Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until further
amended in accordance with the terms thereof and the DGCL. The Merger shall
have the effects set forth in Section 259(a) of the DGCL.

 



 

2.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Prior to the Closing, Merger Sub and the
Company shall prepare and execute, and on the Closing Date they shall cause to
be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate
of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by the
relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware or at such later time as is established by Merger Sub and the
Company and set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

2.3 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 



 

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each of such directors to hold office, subject to the applicable
provisions of the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until the expiration of
the term for which such director was elected and until his or her successor is
elected and has qualified or as otherwise provided by the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their

(i) the term " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ " means the sum of (A) Two
Hundred Eighty-Five Million Dollars ($285,000,000) (the " _Enterprise Value_
"), _plus_ (B) the amount of the Closing Cash, _minus_ (C) the amount of the
Closing Indebtedness, _minus_ (D) the amount of the Company Transaction
Expenses, _plus_ or _minus_ (as applicable) (E) the amount, if any, of the
Purchase Price Adjustment; and

 



 

(ii) the term " _Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration_ " means the sum
of (A) the Aggregate Merger Consideration, _plus_ (B) the aggregate exercise

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Final Merger Consideration_ "
means the Final Common Stock Merger Consideration less the aggregate exercise
price of all Vested Options subject to Option Cancellation Agreements. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any party, each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any Common Shares which are held by any wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company or in the treasury of the Company or held by
Purchaser or Merger Sub, all of which shall cease to be outstanding and be
canceled and none of which shall receive any payment with respect thereto)
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, forthwith cease to exist and be converted into and represent
the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the sum of the Final Merger Consideration,
_minus_ the aggregate amount of all Option Payments, by (y) the number of
Common Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (excluding any Common Shares
which are held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or in the
treasury of the Company or held by Parent or Merger Sub, all of which shall
cease to be outstanding and be canceled and none of which shall receive any

delivered to the Escrow Agent at Closing pursuant to _§ 2.6(b)_ hereof.

 



 

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any party, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Merger Sub, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall remain outstanding and shall be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, so that, after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall be
the holder of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Surviving
Corporations common stock.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, pursuant to the Option Cancellation Agreements,
each outstanding Option shall be canceled as of the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Common Share issuable upon exercise of an Option that
is subject to an Option Cancellation Agreement shall be deemed outstanding for
purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

2.6 _Closing Estimate; Funds Flow and Payments at Closing._

 



 

(a) _Closing Estimate and Funds Flow Statement_. At least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser the

Companys good faith estimate of the amount of the Closing Indebtedness, (iii)
the Companys good faith estimate of the amount of the Company Transaction
Expenses as of the Closing Date, and (iv) the aggregate exercise price of all
Vested Options subject to the Option Cancellation Agreements, which shall
quantify in reasonable detail the items constituting such Closing Cash, such
Closing Indebtedness, such Company Transaction Expenses, and such aggregate
exercise price, if any, and in each case calculated in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Estimated
Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration Payable at Closing_ " means the

(b) _Escrow_. At or immediately following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
deliver or cause to be delivered to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as escrow agent
(the " _Escrow Agent_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
aggregate sum of (x) Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the "
_Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") and (y) Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) (the " _Indemnification Escrow Amount_ "), which shall be
deposited in separate accounts to be known as the " _Purchase Price Adjustment
Escrow Account_ " and the " _Indemnification Escrow Account_ ," each
established pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount shall be
utilized exclusively to fund any adjustment to the Estimated Aggregate Common
Stock Merger Consideration Payable at Closing pursuant to _§ 2.7(e)(i)_ or
_(e)(ii)_ (the " _Purchase Price Adjustment_ ") and the Indemnification
Escrow Amount shall be utilized exclusively to fund any indemnification
obligations of the Stockholders to the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to _§
8.2(a)_ and _§ 8.2(b)_ and to fund any adjustment to the Estimated Aggregate
Common Stock Merger Consideration Payable at Closing pursuant to _§
2.7(e)(ii)_.

 



 

(c) _Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amount_. At or immediately following the
Effective Time, Purchaser shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the
Equityholders Representative the Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amount, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Post-Closing Expense Reserve
Account pursuant to wire transfer instructions set forth on the Closing
Estimate and Funds Flow Statement.

 



 

(d) _Closing Indebtedness_. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be
paid to the holders of the Closing Indebtedness as set forth on the Closing
Estimate and Funds Flow Statement an amount sufficient to repay all such
Indebtedness in accordance with the payoff letters described therein, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to wire transfer instructions
set forth on the Closing Estimate and Funds Flow Statement, with the result
that immediately following the Closing there will be no further monetary
obligations of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any such Closing Indebtedness.

 



 

(e) _Company Transaction Expenses_. At or immediately following the Effective
Time, Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to the Equityholders
Representative all Company Transaction Expenses (other than the Post-Closing
Expense Reserve Amount and the Specified Employer Taxes) evidenced on the
Closing Estimate and Funds Flow Statement, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds pursuant to wire transfer instructions set forth on the
Closing Estimate and Funds Flow Statement, for further payment by the
Equityholders Representative pursuant to the provisions of the Closing
Estimate and Funds Flow Statement. Receipt by the Equityholders
Representative shall constitute payment in full by Purchaser and the Company
of all such Company Transaction Expenses evidenced on the Closing Estimate and
Funds Flow Statement, with no monetary obligations of the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries, or Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect
to any such Company Transaction Expenses.

 



 

(f) _Net Option Closing Payment_. Promptly following the Effective Time on the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each
holder of a

 



      
 

 



 

Vested Option who, prior to the Effective Time, has executed and delivered to
the Equityholders Representative and the Company a counterpart of an Option
Cancellation Agreement (an " _Effective Time Option Holder_ ") the " _Net
Option Closing Payment_ " (as such term is defined in the Option Cancellation
Agreement to which such Effective Time Option Holder is a party) payable to
such Effective Time Option Holder pursuant to such Option Cancellation
Agreement, which payment shall be made on the terms of and subject to the
conditions contained in such Option Cancellation Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Aggregate Net Option Closing Payments_ " means the
aggregate amount of such Net Option Closing Payments payable to the Effective
Time Option Holders pursuant to this _§ 2.6(f)_ and the Option Cancellation
Agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, all calculations of amounts payable by
the Surviving Corporation under the Option Cancellation Agreements shall be
made by the Equityholders Representative and approved by the Surviving
Corporation, such approval to not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned, and such calculations shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties to this Agreement and to the other Transaction Documents.

 



 

(g) _Stock Closing Payment_. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration Payable at Closing_ " means the
Aggregate Merger Consideration calculated using the amounts set forth on the
Closing Estimate and Funds Flow Statement. On the Closing Date upon surrender
by such Stockholder to Purchaser of the certificate(s) representing the Common
Shares held by such Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time (each,
a " _Stock Certificate_ "), or at such later date when a Stockholder
surrenders to the Surviving Corporation its, his or her Stock Certificate(s),
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Stockholder, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of such
Stockholder as set forth on the Closing Estimate and Funds Flow Statement, an
amount (the " _Stockholder Closing Payment_ ") equal to the product of (i) the
Estimated Aggregate Merger Consideration Payable at Closing ( _less_ the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, the Indemnification Escrow Amount,
the Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amount and the Aggregate Net Option Closing
Payments), _multiplied_ _by_ (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of Common Shares owned of record by such Stockholder on the Closing
Date and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of Common Shares
outstanding at the Effective Time (excluding any Common Shares which are held
by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or in the treasury of the
Company or held by Purchaser or Merger Sub, all of which shall cease to be
outstanding and be canceled and none of which shall receive any payment with
respect thereto). Each Stock Certificate shall be accompanied by a duly
completed and executed letter of transmittal, which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Stock
Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Stock
Certificate(s) to Purchaser and contain a certificate of non-foreign status
pursuant to U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B), as
the case may be, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions (but
in no event shall include any restrictive covenants) as Purchaser may
reasonably specify and which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company.
Until so surrendered, each Stock Certificate shall be deemed, for all
corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive upon such surrender
the Merger consideration deliverable in respect thereof to which such Person
is entitled pursuant to this _Article 2_. No interest shall be paid or
accrued in respect of such payments. If the Merger consideration (or any
portion thereof) is to be delivered to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Stock Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it
shall be a condition to the payment of such portion of the Merger
consideration that the Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be

 



      
 

 



 

properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such transfer pay to
the Surviving Corporation any transfer or other Taxes payable by reason of the
foregoing or establish to the satisfaction of Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid. In
the event any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Stock
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock
Certificate the portion of the Merger consideration deliverable in respect
thereof as determined in accordance with this _Article 2_; _provided_ , that
the Person to whom such portion of the Merger consideration is paid shall, as
a condition precedent to the payment or delivery thereof, indemnify Purchaser
and the Surviving Corporation in a manner reasonably satisfactory to them
against any claim that may be made against Purchaser, Merger Sub or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to the Stock Certificate claimed to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

2.7 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the Closing Date, and in any event not later than thirty
(30) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to prepare and deliver to the Equityholders Representative a
statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth: (A) the Surviving
Corporations good faith calculations (the " _Surviving Corporation s
Proposed Calculations_") of (1) the amount of the Closing Cash, (2) the amount
of any Company Transaction Expenses not (x) paid by the Company prior to the
Effective Time, or (y) deducted in connection with the calculation of the
Estimated Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration Payable at Closing, and
(3) the amount of the Closing Indebtedness, and (B) a recalculation of the
Estimated Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration Payable at Closing based
on such amounts. Prior to and following delivery by the Surviving Corporation
of the Closing Statement, the Surviving Corporation shall provide the
Equityholders Representative and its Representatives with prompt and
reasonable access to the books and records of the Surviving Corporation,
Merger Sub and the Company, as the case may be, and any other document or
information reasonably requested by the Equityholders Representative in order
to allow the Equityholders Representative and its Representatives to verify
the accuracy of the Surviving Corporations Proposed Calculations.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Equityholders Representative does not object to the
Surviving Corporations Proposed Calculations by written notice of objection
(the " _Notice of Objection_ ") delivered to the Surviving Corporation within
thirty (30) days after the Equityholders Representatives receipt of the
Closing Statement, such Notice of Objection to set forth in reasonable detail
(A) the Equityholders Representatives alternative calculations (the "
_Equityholders  Representatives Proposed Calculations_") of (i) the amount
of the Closing Cash, (ii) the amount of any Company Transaction Expenses not
(x) paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time, or (y) deducted in
connection with the calculation of the Estimated Aggregate Common Stock Merger
Consideration Payable at Closing, and (iii) the amount of the Closing
Indebtedness, and (B) a recalculation of the Estimated Aggregate Common Stock
Merger Consideration Payable at Closing based on such amounts, the
recalculation of the Estimated Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration
Payable at Closing as set forth in the Surviving Corporations Proposed
Calculations shall be deemed final and binding.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) If the Equityholders Representative delivers a Notice of Objection to the
Surviving Corporation within the thirty (30) day period referred to in _§
2.7(b)_, then (A) any amount of the Surviving Corporations proposed
recalculation of the Estimated Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration
Payable at Closing that is not in dispute on the date such Notice of Objection
is given shall be treated as final and binding, and (B) any dispute with
respect to the Surviving Corporations proposed recalculation of the Estimated
Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration Payable at Closing (all such
disputed amounts with respect to the calculation of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration, the " _Disputed Amounts_ ") shall be resolved as follows:

 



 

(i) The Equityholders Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly endeavor in good faith to resolve the Disputed Amounts listed in the
Notice of Objection. In the event that a written agreement determining the
Disputed Amounts has not been reached within fifteen (15) Business Days after
the date of receipt by the Surviving Corporation from the Equityholders
Representative of the Notice of Objection, the Equityholders Representative
and the Surviving Corporation shall select the Los Angeles office of a
mutually acceptable and nationally recognized independent accounting firm
(such firm, the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to resolve the Disputed
Amounts in accordance with the provisions of this _§ 2.7(c)_. The parties
acknowledge that the Los Angeles office of Deloitte and Touche LLP is a mutually
acceptable firm to be designated as the Independent Accounting Firm.

 



 

(ii) The Independent Accounting Firm shall conduct its own review and
verification of any item set forth on the Closing Statement and shall select
either the Equityholders Representatives Proposed Calculations of the
Disputed Amounts or the Surviving Corporations Proposed Calculations of the
Disputed Amounts or an amount in between the two.

 



 

(iii) The Equityholders Representative and the Surviving Corporation shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting
Firm to render a decision in accordance with this _§ 2.7(c)_, along with a
statement of reasons therefor, within thirty (30) days of the submission of
the Disputed Amounts to the Independent Accounting Firm or a reasonable time
thereafter. The decision of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and
binding upon the Equityholders Representative, the Equityholders, Purchaser
and the Surviving Corporation and the decision of the Independent Accounting
Firm shall constitute an arbitral award that is final, binding and non-
appealable and upon which a judgment may be entered by a court having
jurisdiction thereover.

 



 

(iv) In the event the Equityholders Representative and the Surviving
Corporation submit any Disputed Amounts to the Independent Accounting Firm for
resolution, the Surviving Corporation and the Equityholders Representative
(on behalf of the Equityholders) shall each pay their own costs and expenses
incurred under this _§ 2.7(c)_ and the fees and costs of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the parties as follows:

 



       
 

 



 

(A) if the difference between the absolute value of the Equityholders
Representatives aggregate position with respect to the Disputed Amounts and
the Independent Accounting Firms final determination with respect to the
Disputed Amounts is greater than the difference between the absolute value of
the Surviving Corporations aggregate position with respect to the Disputed
Amounts and the Independent Accounting Firms final determination with respect
to the Disputed Amounts, then the Equityholders, jointly and severally to the
extent of the Post-Closing Expense Reserve Funds and the Indemnification
Escrow Funds, shall be responsible for all of the fees and costs of the
Independent Accounting Firm;

 



 

(B) if the difference between the absolute value of the Equityholders
Representatives aggregate position with respect to the Disputed Amounts and
the Independent Accounting Firms final determination with respect to the
Disputed Amounts is less than the difference between the absolute value of the
Surviving Corporations aggregate position with respect to the Disputed
Amounts and the Independent Accounting Firms final determination with respect
to the Disputed Amounts, then the Surviving Corporation shall be responsible
for all of the fees and costs of the Independent Accounting Firm; and

 



 

(C) if the absolute value of the Equityholders Representatives aggregate
position with respect to the Disputed Amounts and the Independent Accounting
Firms final determination with respect to the Disputed Amounts is equal to
the difference between the absolute value of the Surviving Corporations
aggregate position with respect to the Disputed Amounts and the Independent
Accounting Firms final determination with respect to the Disputed Amounts,
then the fees and costs of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne one-
half by the Equityholders, jointly and severally to the extent of the Post-
Closing Expense Reserve Funds and the Indemnification Escrow Funds, and one-
half by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) The Independent Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator to determine,
based upon the provisions of this _§ 2.7(d)_, only the Disputed Amounts and
the determination of each amount of the Disputed Amounts shall be made in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _§ 2.7(a)_, and in no event shall
the Independent Accounting Firms calculation of any Disputed Amount be (i)
less than the lesser of the amount claimed by either the Surviving Corporation
or the Equityholders Representative, or (ii) greater than the greater of the
amount claimed by either the Surviving Corporation or the Equityholders
Representative.

 



 

(e) Upon the determination, in accordance with _§ §2.7(b)_ or _2.7(d)_ , of
the final calculations of the amounts of (1) the Closing Cash, (2) the Company
Transaction Expenses not (x) paid by the Company prior to the Effective Time,
or (y) deducted in connection with the calculation of the Estimated Aggregate
Common Stock Merger Consideration Payable At Closing, and (3) the Closing
Indebtedness, the Estimated Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration
Payable at Closing shall be recalculated using such finally determined amounts
in lieu of the amounts used in the Closing Estimate and Funds Flow Statement.
The term " _Final_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Common Stock Merger Consideration_ " means the result of such recalculation
of the Estimated Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration Payable at
Closing.

 



 

(i) If the Final Common Stock Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration Payable at Closing (the amount of
such deficiency is referred to herein as the " _Deficiency_ ") and the
Deficiency is less than the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow
Amount, then the Equityholders Representative and Purchaser shall, pursuant
to the Escrow Agreement, direct the Escrow Agent to (A) distribute the amount
of the Deficiency from the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account to or as
directed by the Surviving Corporation, (B) distribute to the Surviving
Corporation (for further distribution to the Effective Time Option Holders)
the aggregate amount of the " _Partial Purchase Price Escrow Distribution
Option Payments_ " (as such term is defined in the Option Cancellation
Agreements) payable to the Effective Time Option Holders pursuant to the
Option Cancellation Agreements, which Partial Purchase Price Escrow
Distribution Option Payments shall be made on the terms of and subject to the
conditions contained in the Option Cancellation Agreements, and (C) distribute
the remaining amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds to the
Equityholders Representative, for further distribution to the Stockholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares (and shall thereafter cause
the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Account to be closed).

 



 

(ii) If the Final Common Stock Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated
Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration Payable at Closing and the amount
of the Deficiency is equal to or greater than the amount of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount, then the Equityholders Representative and Purchaser
shall, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, direct the Escrow Agent to distribute
(x) the entire Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount and (y) a portion of
the Indemnification Escrow Amount equal to the Deficiency remaining after
application of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Amount to or as directed
by the Surviving Corporation (and shall thereafter cause the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Account to be closed). Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchasers sole recourse for payment of the
Deficiency pursuant to this _§ 2.7(e)(ii)_ shall be the Purchase Price
Adjustment Escrow Amount and, to the extent necessary, the Indemnification
Escrow Amount and neither Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Affiliates shall have any direct claim against any
Equityholder in respect thereof.

 



 

(iii) If the Final Common Stock Merger Consideration is greater than the
Estimated Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration Payable at Closing (the
amount of such excess is referred to herein as the " _Positive Adjustment
Amount_ "), then:

 



 

(A) the Equityholders Representative and Purchaser shall, pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement, direct the Escrow Agent to (1) distribute to

 



      
 

 



 

the Surviving Corporation (for further distribution to the Effective Time
Option Holders) the aggregate amount of the " _Purchase Price Escrow
Distribution Option Payments_ " (as such term is defined in the Option
Cancellation Agreements) payable to the Effective Time Option Holders pursuant
to the Option Cancellation Agreements, which Purchase Price Escrow
Distribution Option Payments shall be made on the terms of and subject to the
conditions contained in the Option Cancellation Agreements, and (2) distribute
the remaining amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds to the
Equityholders Representative, for further distribution to the Stockholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares;

 



 

(B) the Surviving Corporation shall pay or cause to be paid to each Effective
Time Option Holder the " _Final Option Payment_ " (as such term is defined in
the Option Cancellation Agreement to which such Effective Time Option Holder
is a party) payable to such Effective Time Option Holder pursuant to such
Option Cancellation Agreement, which Final Option Payment shall be made on the
terms of and subject to the conditions contained in such Option Cancellation
Agreement; and

 



 

(C) the Surviving Corporation shall, within three (3) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Common Stock Merger Consideration, pay or cause to
be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of the
Equityholders Representative, for further distribution to the Stockholders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares, an amount in cash equal to
the Positive Adjustment Amount less the aggregate amount of the Final Option
Payments.

 



 

2.8 _No Further Rights of Transfers_. At and after the Effective Time, each
Stockholder shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of the Company,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law, and no transfer of Common
Shares shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation.
At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the stock ledger of
the Company with respect to the Common Shares shall be closed.

 



 

2.9 _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall have been abandoned pursuant to
_Article 7_, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions set forth in _Article 6_, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at 9:00 A.M., Central Time, at the offices of
Dorsey and Whitney LLP, 50 South Sixth Street, Minneapolis, MN 55402 or such
other place as shall be agreed to by Purchaser and the Equityholders
Representative (or by facsimile, electronic mail or overnight courier delivery
as the parties may agree), as soon as practicable, but in any event, within
three (3) Business Days after the last of the conditions set forth in _Article
6_ is satisfied or waived, other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver
of those conditions, or at such other date, time or place as the parties
hereto shall agree in writing. Such date is herein referred to as the "
_Closing Date._ " Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
proceedings to be taken and all documents to be executed at the Closing shall
be deemed to have been taken, delivered and executed simultaneously, and no
proceeding shall be deemed taken nor documents deemed executed or

 



      
 

 



 

delivered until all have been taken, delivered and executed. For accounting
purposes, the effective time of the Closing shall be deemed to be 12:01 a.m.,
Los Angeles time, on the Closing Date.

 



 

2.10 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers of
the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the
Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right,

acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 3 
Representations and Warranties of the Company**

 



 

A. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser and Merger Sub as
of the date of this Agreement as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Due Organization, Good Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of the
Company, Tri-Star Electronics International and Tri-Star Europe is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Tri-Star Technologies is a
general partnership existing under the laws of the State of California. The
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries has all requisite corporate (or,
in the case of Tri-Star Technologies, partnership) power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted. The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction set
forth on _Schedule 3.1_. _Schedule 3.1_ lists all jurisdictions in which the
property owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or the nature of the business conducted by the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries makes such qualification necessary, except in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good
standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. The Company has made available to Purchaser prior to
the date hereof complete and correct copies of the Companys certificate of
incorporation and the Companys bylaws and the comparable Organizational
Documents of each of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case, as amended and in
effect as of the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, or comparable Organizational Documents.

 



 

3.2 _Authorization; Noncontravention_.

 



 

(a) The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a
party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder, and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation by it of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, have been duly authorized and
approved by the Board. The Stockholders have adopted and approved this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. No other
corporate action on the part of the Company is necessary to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (other than the filing of
appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL). This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Purchaser and Merger Sub,
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against
the Company in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its
enforceability may be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

any corporation, partnership, association or other business organization or
division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if the

and the Company Subsidiaries shall submit to a stockholder vote (along with
adequate disclosure satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii)
of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder) the right of any "
_disqualified individual_ " with respect to the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive any
payment that would constitute a " _parachute payment_ " (within the meaning of
Section 280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) and as to which such individual waives
his or her rights as described in the following sentence in a manner that
satisfies the shareholder approval requirements of Section 280G(b)(5) of the
Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder to the extent necessary to
cause any such payment to not constitute an " _excess parachute payment_ "
within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code. To the extent that any
such " _disqualified individual_ " has the right to receive payments that
could constitute " _parachute payments_ " and elects to waive such rights, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall obtain waivers of
such rights prior to soliciting the vote described in the immediately
preceding sentence such that the vote shall, if successful, establish each
disqualified individuals right to the payment. The Company and the Company
Subsidiaries shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Purchaser a draft of
all shareholder vote related documents, including, but not limited to, any
disclosure documents and disqualified individual waivers. The Company and the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Subsidiaries shall incorporate any reasonable comments that are made
by Purchaser. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in
connection with the preparation of such shareholder vote related documents.

determined as of such date, and (ii) for inaccuracies of representations or
warranties the circumstances giving rise to which do not constitute a Material

disregarded.

 



 

(c) _Closing Certificate_. Purchaser and Merger Sub, respectively, shall have
delivered to the Equityholders Representative a certificate, executed by a

 **ARTICLE 7 
Termination**

 



 

7.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company, Purchaser and Merger Sub;

 



 

(b) by either Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
if (i) any court or other Authority shall have issued, enacted, entered,
promulgated or enforced any Law or Order (that has not been vacated, withdrawn
or overturned) restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and
such Law or Order shall have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , that
the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this _§ 7.1(b)(i)_ shall have used
its commercially reasonable efforts to challenge such Law or Order in
accordance with _§ 5.4_, or (ii) the transactions contemplated hereby have not
been consummated by December 31, 2011 (January 31, 2012 if there is an
Antitrust Delay) (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _§ 7.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be
available to any party whose breach of its obligations under this Agreement
has been the cause of, or resulted in, the inability of such condition to be
satisfied;

 



 

(c) by either Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
if any condition to such partys obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby

 



      
 

 



 

is incapable of being satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _§
7.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of its obligations
under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the inability of
such condition to be satisfied; or

 



 

(d) by the Company if Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Antitrust Authority any formal request for additional information or
documentary material and Purchaser does not notify the Company in writing,

7.2_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Nothing in this _§ 7.2_
shall relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for fraud or willful
and material breach of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive termination of this
Agreement for any reason; _provided_ , that Purchaser will have no further
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement after the Effective Time.

and

 



 

(c) each Stockholder (severally and not jointly) shall indemnify, protect and
defend the Purchaser Indemnitees and hold each of them harmless against any
Losses incurred by them as a result of the breach of any representation or
warranty made by such Stockholder in _Article 3_.

 



 

8.3 _Indemnification by Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation_. Subject to
the other provisions of this _Article 8_ , from and after the Closing,
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation (jointly and severally) shall
indemnify, protect and defend the Equityholders and their Affiliates and their

8.4 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement but
subject to the provisions of _§ 8.4(b)_, the Stockholders shall not be liable
for any Claim for indemnification pursuant to _§ 8.2(a)_ resulting from an
inaccuracy or misrepresentation in or breach of any of the representations and
warranties of the Company, other than a Claim based upon a breach, inaccuracy
or misrepresentation of a Fundamental Representation (to which the Basket
Amount shall not apply), unless and until the aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Stockholders equals or
exceeds One Million Four Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($1,425,000)
(the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which case the Stockholders shall be liable only
for the amount of the Losses in excess of the Basket Amount; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that for purposes of this _§ 8.4(a)_, in determining the amount of
any Losses resulting from or in connection with the breach of any of the
representations and warranties made by the Company in _Article 3_ of this
Agreement, such representations and warranties (except for representations and
warranties contained in _§ 3.5(a)_ and _(b)_ ), shall be read as though none
of them contained any reference to Material Adverse Effect or other
materiality qualifiers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Purchaser and Merger Sub shall not be liable for any Claim for
indemnification pursuant to _§ 8.3_ resulting from an inaccuracy or
misrepresentation in or breach of any of the representations and warranties of
Purchaser and Merger Sub, other than a Claim based upon a breach, inaccuracy
or misrepresentation of a Fundamental Representation (to which the Basket
Amount shall not apply), unless and until the aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from Purchaser and Merger Sub
equals or exceeds the Basket Amount, in which case Purchaser and Merger Sub
shall be liable only for the amount of the Losses in excess of the Basket
Amount; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this _§ 8.4(a)_, in
determining the amount of any Losses resulting from or in connection with the
breach of any of the representations and warranties made by Purchaser and
Merger Sub in _Article 4_ of this Agreement, such representations and
warranties shall be read as though none of them contained any reference to
Material Adverse Effect or other materiality qualifiers.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(other than as set forth in the immediately following proviso), the maximum
aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the
Stockholders for indemnification pursuant to _§ 8.2(a)_, other than Losses
based upon a breach, inaccuracy or misrepresentation of a Fundamental
Representation (to which the liability cap described in this §8.4(b) shall not
apply), shall be the Indemnification Escrow Amount, and the Indemnification
Escrow Amount will be (i) the sole recourse, directly or indirectly, of the
Purchaser Indemnitees for indemnification pursuant to such _§ 8.2(a)_, and
(ii) the primary recourse, directly or indirectly, of the Purchaser
Indemnitees for indemnification pursuant to _§ 8.2(b)_ (it being agreed that
the Purchaser Indemnitees shall have no recourse directly against the
Stockholders pursuant to _§ 8.2(b)_ until there are no remaining
Indemnification Escrow Funds); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or otherwise affect any action based on fraud by any
party. In no event shall any of the Purchaser Indemnitees have recourse to the
Indemnification Escrow Account for

 



      
 

 



 

any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Stockholders in Part

Agreement (other than as set forth in the immediately following proviso), the
maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from
the Purchaser and Merger Sub for indemnification pursuant to _§ 8.3_, other
than Losses based upon a breach, inaccuracy or misrepresentation of a
Fundamental Representation (to which the liability cap described in this
§8.4(b) shall not apply), shall be Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000);
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall limit or
otherwise affect any action based on fraud by any party.

 



 

(c) The representations and warranties of the Company and the Stockholders
contained in _Article 3_ are qualified by, and the Stockholders shall have no
liability in respect of, the facts and circumstances disclosed in the
Schedules to the extent that the nature and scope of the matters arising from
such facts and circumstances is reasonably apparent from such disclosure.

 



 

8.5 _Losses Net of Insurance; Tax Benefits; Etc_. The amount of any Loss for
which indemnification is provided under _§ 8.2_ or _§ 8.3_ shall take into
account any Tax benefits actually received in or before the taxable period
that includes the indemnity payment (solely through a reduction in cash Tax
payments required to be made or an increase in Tax refunds actually received)
and net of any cash Tax costs, in each case, as a result of the Loss or
receipt of an indemnity payment on a claim therefor, and shall be net of (i)
any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party pursuant to any
indemnification by or indemnification agreement with any third party, and (ii)
any insurance proceeds actually received as an offset against such Loss (each
Person named in clauses (i) and (ii), a " _Collateral Source_ ").
Indemnification under this _Article 8_ shall not be available unless the
Indemnified Party first uses commercially reasonable efforts to seek recovery
under all insurance policies. If the amount to be netted hereunder in
connection with a Collateral Source from any payment required under _§ §8.2_
or _8.3_ is determined after payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount
otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified Party under this _Article 8_ ,
the Indemnified Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after
such determination, any amount that the Indemnifying Party would not have had
to pay pursuant to this _Article 8_ had such determination been made at the
time of such payment.

 



 

8.6 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Promptly after the incurrence of any Losses by any Person entitled to
indemnification pursuant to _§ §8.2_ or _8.3_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ "),
including, any claim by a third party described in _§ 8.7_, which might give
rise to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall (x) if the
party (or parties) from which indemnification is sought is a Stockholder (or
are the Stockholders), deliver to the Equityholders Representative, and (y)
if the party from which indemnification is sought is Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation, deliver to the Surviving Corporation (for purposes of
_§ 8.5_, this _§ 8.6_ and _§ 8.7_, the party or parties from which
indemnification is sought are referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a
certificate (a " _Claim Certificate_ ") ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure by the Indemnified Party(ies) to so deliver a Claim Certificate shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party(ies) of their obligations hereunder, except
to the extent that the Indemnified Party(ies) are materially prejudiced by
such failure), which Claim Certificate shall:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) state that the Indemnified Party has paid or anticipates it will incur
liability for Losses for which such Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) specify in reasonable detail (and have annexed thereto all reasonably
available supporting documentation, including any non-privileged
correspondence in connection with any Third Party Claim and, to the extent
applicable, evidence of payment for claimed Losses) each individual item of
Loss included in the amount so stated, the date such item was paid (if
applicable), the basis for any anticipated liability and the nature of the
breach of representation or warranty or breach of covenant or claim to which
each such item is related and any computation or calculation supporting the
amount to which such Indemnified Party claims to be entitled hereunder.

 



 

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall object to the
indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim or claims
specified in any Claim Certificate, the Indemnifying Party shall, within
thirty (30) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such Claim
Certificate, deliver to the Indemnified Party a notice to such effect,
specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such objection and providing all
supporting documentation reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party, and
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall, within the thirty (30)
day period beginning on the date of receipt by the Indemnified Party of such
objection, attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective
parties with respect to each of such claims to which the Indemnifying Party
shall have so objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall succeed in reaching agreement on their respective rights with respect to
any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth such agreement. Should
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party be unable to agree as to any
particular item or items or amount or amounts within such time period, then
the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to submit such dispute to a court of
competent jurisdiction as set forth in _§ 9.9_.

 



 

(c) Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate to which an
Indemnifying Party shall not object in writing within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such Claim Certificate, Claims for Losses covered by a memorandum
of agreement of the nature described in _§ 8.6(b)_, and Claims for Losses the
validity and amount of which have been the subject of judicial determination
as described in _§ 9.9_ or shall have been settled with the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, as described in _§ 8.7_, are hereinafter referred to,
collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_." Within ten (10) Business Days of the
determination of the amount of any Agreed Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall
pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Party an amount equal to the Agreed
Claim by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank account or
accounts designated by the Indemnified Party in a notice to the Indemnifying
Party not less than two (2) Business Days prior to such payment.

 



 

8.7 _Third Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) If a claim by a third party is made against any Indemnified Party with
respect to which the Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnification
hereunder for any Loss under this _Article 8_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the failure by the Indemnified Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party(ies)
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party(ies) of their obligations hereunder,
except to the extent that the Indemnified Party(ies) are materially prejudiced
by such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice to notify the Indemnified Party if the Indemnifying
Party has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled at its own expense to conduct and control
the defense of, but not the settlement of, such Third Party Claim through
counsel of its own choosing on behalf of the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days after receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying
Party has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim or if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim,
then, notwithstanding any provision of this _§ 8.7_ to the contrary, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding any provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim (unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by the Indemnified Party) if (i) the claim for
indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal, fraud or
other governmental Authority proceeding, action, allegation, investigation or
indictment, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party has failed or
is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim.

 



 

(b) Any compromise, settlement or offer of settlement of any Third Party Claim
by the Indemnifying Party shall require the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Unless such consent is obtained, the Indemnifying
Party shall continue the defense of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if the Indemnified Party refuses its consent to a bona fide offer of
settlement that the Indemnifying Party wishes to accept and that involves no
payment of money by the Indemnified Party, and further involves no material
limitation on the future operation of the business, assets or property of the
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, and that releases the Indemnified Party
from all liability in connection with such claim, the Indemnifying Party may
reassign the defense of such claim to the Indemnified Party, who may then
continue to pursue the defense of such matter, free of any participation by
the Indemnifying Party, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party.
In such event, the obligation of the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto
shall not exceed the amount of the offer of settlement that the Indemnified
Party refused to accept plus the reasonable costs and expenses of the
Indemnified Party prior to the date the Indemnifying Party notified the
Indemnified Party of the offer of settlement.

 



 

(c) No Indemnified Party may compromise or settle any Third Party Claim for
which it is seeking indemnification hereunder without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that if the Indemnifying Party does not
elect to conduct the defense and settlement of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with this _§ 8.7_, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in such defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim at the
Indemnifying Partys sole expense.

 



 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate
in, but not control, the defense of any such action or suit through counsel
chosen by the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party
elects not to control or conduct the defense or prosecution of a Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of such
Third Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ the Indemnifying Party nevertheless shall have the right to
participate in the defense or prosecution of any such Third Party Claim and,
at its own expense, to employ counsel of its own choosing for such purpose.

 



 

(e) The parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim, with such cooperation to include (i) the
retention, after receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim, and the provision
to the Indemnifying Party of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to such Third Party Claim, and (ii) the making available of employees
on a mutually convenient basis for providing additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder.

 



 

8.8 _Sole Remedy/Waiver_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
subject to the last sentence of this _§ 8.8_, the remedies provided for in
this _Article 8_ shall be the parties sole and exclusive remedy for any
breach of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and the Company
hereby waives, effective upon the occurrence of the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and
causes of action (including rights of contribution, if any, and claims for
rescission) known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise
in the future, that it may have against any of the Stockholders, the
Equityholders Representative or any of their respective Representatives, or
any member of the board of directors of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
as the case may be, arising under or based upon any federal, state or local
Law (including any such Law relating to environmental matters or arising under
or based upon any securities law, common law or otherwise) for any breach of
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to prevent or restrict the bringing or
maintenance of any such claim or action, or the granting of any such remedy,
to the extent that the same shall have been the result of fraud by any Person.

the party incurring such costs and expenses.

in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute, a
waiver of any other provisions, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver
constitute a continuing waiver.

communications required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be

9.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
contain the entire understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter contained herein and therein and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, oral and written, with respect thereto, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect until
the Closing has occurred, at which time it shall be deemed terminated and of
no further force or effect.

 



 

9.5 _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment_. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Subject to the preceding sentence, except as
set forth in _§ 5.8_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Person other than Purchaser, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Equityholders, the Equityholders Representative or their
respective successors, heirs, personal representatives or permitted assigns,
any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of
each of the other parties; _provided_ , that Purchaser, Merger Sub and, after
the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall each have the right to assign any
of its rights under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, so long as the
assigning party remains liable for such Affiliates obligations hereunder.

 



 

9.6 _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto at any time prior to the Effective Time by their respective boards of
directors; _provided_ , that no amendment that requires stockholder vote under
applicable Law shall be made without such requisite vote. Subject to the
foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and
only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the Equityholders (or the Equityholders Representative on their
behalf), Purchaser and Merger Sub, or in the case of a waiver, by the party
against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof

 



      
 

 



 

preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or privilege.

 



 

9.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the several parties hereto in separate counterparts
(including by means of telecopied signature pages or signature pages in "pdf"
or similar format sent as an attachment to an electronic mail message), each
of which shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument.

 



 

9.8 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Mail Attachment_. This Agreement and
any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this
Agreement, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of a facsimile machine or as an attachment to an electronic
mail message in "pdf" or similar format, shall be treated in all manner and
respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person. At the request of any party hereto or to any such
agreement or instrument, each other party hereto or thereto shall re-execute
original forms thereof and deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto
or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile
machine or electronic mail attachment in "pdf" or similar format to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or as an
attachment to an electronic mail message as a defense to the formation of a
contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.

 



 

9.9 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_. THIS
AGREEMENT AND THE LEGAL RELATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT
REGARD TO THE CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES THEREOF. THE STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS
LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER
ANY AND ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY,
ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE PARTIES CONSENT TO AND AGREE TO SUBMIT
TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY
WAIVES AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT IN ANY SUCH DISPUTE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY CLAIM THAT (A) SUCH PARTY IS NOT PERSONALLY
SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS, (B) SUCH PARTY AND SUCH PARTYS
PROPERTY IS IMMUNE FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS ISSUED BY SUCH COURTS OR (C) ANY
LITIGATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS IS BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM. THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE THAT MAILING OF PROCESS OR OTHER
PAPERS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN THE MANNER PROVIDED
IN _§ 9.3_, OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS MAY BE PERMITTED BY LAW, SHALL BE VALID
AND SUFFICIENT SERVICE THEREOF AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTIONS TO SERVICE
ACCOMPLISHED IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN THIS _§ 9.9_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT SUCH PARTY MAY
LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING
ARISING HEREUNDER.

 



      
 

 



 

9.10 _Severability_. It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto that
the provisions of this Agreement be enforced to the fullest extent permissible
under the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction in which
enforcement is sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this
Agreement shall be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, prohibited or unenforceable for any reason, such provision, as to
such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision
in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such provision
could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be invalid, prohibited or
unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such jurisdiction, be so
narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any
other jurisdiction.

 



 

9.11 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
Accordingly, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

9.12 _Attorney s Fees_. In the event any suit or other legal proceeding is
brought for the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that the prevailing party or parties shall be entitled to
recover from the other party or parties upon final judgment on the merits
reasonable attorneys fees, including attorneys fees for any appeal, and
costs incurred in bringing and/or defending such suit or proceeding.

 



 

9.13 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as set forth in _§ 8.8_ and otherwise in
this Agreement, no remedy made available by any of the provisions of this
Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy, and each and every
remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy
given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.

 



 

9.14 _Conflict of Interest_. If the Equityholders or the Equityholders
Representative so desire, and without the need for any consent or waiver by
the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, Greenberg Traurig, LLP is permitted to
represent the Equityholders and/or the Equityholders Representative after the
Closing in connection with any matter, including without limitation anything
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any disagreement
or dispute relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
after the Closing, Greenberg Traurig, LLP is permitted to represent the
Equityholders, the Equityholders Representative, any of their agents and
affiliates, or any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation,
transaction or dispute (" _dispute_ " includes litigation, arbitration or
other adversary proceeding) with Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or, any
Company Subsidiary or any of their respective agents or Affiliates under or
relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
and any related matter. Upon and after the Closing, the Surviving Corporation
and each of the Company Subsidiaries shall cease to have any attorney-client
relationship with Greenberg Traurig, LLP, unless and to the extent Greenberg
Traurig, LLP is specifically engaged in writing by the Surviving Corporation
or any Company Subsidiary to represent the Surviving Corporation or any
Company Subsidiary after the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

and either such engagement involves no conflict of interest with respect to
the Equityholders or the Equityholders Representative, or the Equityholders
or the Equityholders Representative (as applicable) consent in writing at the
time to such engagement. Any such representation of the Surviving Corporation
or any Company Subsidiary by Greenberg Traurig, LLP after the Closing will not
affect the foregoing provisions hereof. For example, and not by way of
limitation, even if Greenberg Traurig, LLP is representing the Surviving
Corporation after the Closing, Greenberg Traurig, LLP is permitted
simultaneously to represent the Equityholders and/or the Equityholders
Representative in any matter, including any disagreement or dispute relating
hereto. Furthermore, Greenberg Traurig, LLP is permitted to withdraw from any
representation of the Surviving Company or any Company Subsidiary in order to
be able to represent or continue so representing the Equityholders or the
Equityholders Representative, even if such withdrawal causes the Surviving
Company or any Company Subsidiary or Purchaser additional legal expense (such
as to bring new counsel "up to speed"), delay or other prejudice.

 



 

9.15 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
guarantees the payment and performance of all obligations of Purchaser and
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, including the payment of all amounts
due to the Equityholders as provided herein in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, the Option Cancellation Agreements and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10 
Appointment of Equityholders Representative**

 



 

10.1 _Appointment_. The Equityholders hereby constitute, appoint and empower
effective from and after the date hereof, Brockway Moran and Partners Fund II,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, as the Representative of the
Equityholders hereunder (in such capacity, the " _Equityholders 
Representative_"), for the benefit of the Equityholders and the exclusive
agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of each Equityholder, in
connection with and to facilitate the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which shall include the power and authority: (i) to

Written Consent) in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby as the Equityholders Representative, in its
sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable, (ii) to collect, hold and
disburse the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Funds, the Indemnification
Escrow Funds and the Post-Closing Expense Reserve Funds in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement, (iii) as the Equityholders Representative, to
enforce and protect the rights and interests of the Equityholders and to
enforce and protect the rights and interests of such Persons arising out of or
under or in any manner relating to this Agreement and the transactions
provided for herein (including, without limitation, in connection with any and
all claims for indemnification brought under _Article 8_), and to take any
and all actions which the Equityholders Representative believes are necessary
or appropriate under this Agreement for and on behalf of the Equityholders
including, consenting to, compromising or settling any such claims, conducting
negotiations with Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Representatives regarding such claims, and, in connection therewith, to (A)
assert any claim or institute any action, proceeding or investigation, (B)
investigate, defend, contest or litigate any claim, action, proceeding or
investigation initiated by Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any other
Person, or by any Authority against the Equityholders Representative and/or
any of the Equityholders, and receive process on behalf of any or all

 



      
 

 



 

Equityholders in any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation and
compromise or settle on such terms as the Equityholders Representative shall
determine to be appropriate, and give receipts, releases and discharges with
respect to, any such claim, action, proceeding or investigation, (C) file any
proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the Equityholders Representative may
deem advisable or necessary, (D) settle or compromise any claims asserted
under this Agreement and (E) file and prosecute appeals from any decision,
judgment or award rendered in any such action, proceeding or investigation, it
being understood that the Equityholders Representative shall not have any
obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have any liability for any
failure to take any such actions, (iv) to refrain from enforcing any right of
the Equityholders arising out of or under or in any manner relating to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such failure to act on the part of
the Equityholders Representative, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, shall be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the
Equityholders Representative or by the Equityholders unless such waiver is in
writing signed by the waiving party or by the Equityholders Representative,
(v) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other agreements,
guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions,
certificates, stock powers, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do
any and all things and to take any and all action that the Equityholders
Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or
proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (vi) to engage special counsel, accountants
and other advisors and incur such other expenses on behalf of the
Equityholders in connection with any matter arising under this Agreement.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT TO THE CONTRARY, THE
EQUITYHOLDERS REPRESENTATIVE SHALL HAVE NO POWER OR AUTHORITY TO ACT FOR OR
ON BEHALF OF AN STOCKHOLDER IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM FOR INDEMNIFICATION
THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF _§ 8.2(b)_.

 



 

10.2 _Investment of Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amount_.

 



 

(a) Until the release of the Post-Closing Expense Reserve Funds pursuant to _§
10.3_, the Equityholders Representative shall invest and reinvest the Post-
Closing Expense Reserve Amount solely (a) in direct obligations of the United
States of America, obligations for which the full faith and credit of the
United States is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest,
commercial paper of an issuer organized under the Laws of a state of the
United States of America rated of the highest quality by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc., or Standard and Poors Ratings Group, or certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of a United States
commercial bank having at least $1,000,000,000 in assets (collectively, "
_Permitted Investments_ "), or (b) in money market funds which are invested in
Permitted Investments. If necessary to pay any expenses or satisfy any
distributions under _§ 10.3_, the Equityholders Representative may sell or
liquidate, in its sole discretion, any one or more investments prior to
maturity and the Equityholders Representative shall not be liable to the
Equityholders or any of them for any loss or penalties resulting from or
relating to such sale or liquidation.

 



 

(b) Each Equityholder shall be entitled to receive its, his or her Pro Rata
Share of any interest or other income earned on the Post-Closing Expense
Reserve Amount and any such income shall be distributed to the Equityholders
upon the release of the Post-Closing

 



      
 

 



 

Expense Reserve Amount pursuant to the last sentence of _§ 10.3(b)_ with
respect to periods thereafter. For purposes of income tax reporting, the
Equityholders Representative will allocate any such interest or other income
accrued or paid on the Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amount to the
Equityholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares and each such
Equityholder shall treat and report such interest or other income as income on
all Tax Returns filed by such Equityholder.

 



 

10.3 _Expense Reimbursement; Indemnification; Release of Post-Closing Expense
Reserve Funds_.

 



 

(a) The Equityholders Representative shall be entitled to receive
reimbursement from, and be indemnified by, the Equityholders (severally and
not jointly) for certain expenses, charges and liabilities as provided below.
In connection with this Agreement, and in exercising or failing to exercise
all or any of the powers conferred upon the Equityholders Representative
hereunder, (i) the Equityholders Representative shall incur no responsibility
whatsoever to any Equityholder by reason of any error in judgment or other act
or omission performed or omitted hereunder, excepting only responsibility for
any act or failure to act which represents gross negligence or willful
misconduct, and (ii) the Equityholders Representative shall be entitled to
rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or other independent experts
experienced in the matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or
omission of the Equityholders Representative pursuant to such advice shall in
no event subject the Equityholders Representative to liability to any
Equityholder.

 



 

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amount has
been taken into account for purposes of calculating the Aggregate Net Option
Closing Payments and the Estimated Aggregate Common Stock Merger Consideration
Payable at Closing. Accordingly, the Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amount shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Equityholders at the Closing in accordance with their respective Pro Rata
Shares.

 



 

(c) The Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amount (together with any interest or
other income earned on the Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amount) shall be
disbursed from time to time after the Closing Date as determined by the
Equityholders Representative in its sole discretion in payment of any fees
and expenses incurred by the Equityholders Representative for the benefit of
the Equityholders in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the fees and expenses of accountants, attorneys
and other agents and professional advisers in connection with any such matter,
and such disbursements shall be borne by each Equityholder pro rata in
accordance with such Equityholders Pro Rata Share. Unless otherwise
determined by the Equityholders Representative in its sole discretion, on the
date which is thirty (30) days after the first anniversary of the Closing, all
Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amounts (together with any interest or other
income earned on the Post-Closing Expense Reserve Amount) remaining on such
date shall be released by the Equityholders Representative and distributed to
the Equityholders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, pursuant to
written instructions delivered to the Equityholders Representative by each
Equityholder or, if no such instructions have been received from any such
Equityholder, by check mailed to such Equityholders last known address.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Each Equityholder shall indemnify, severally and not jointly, based on
such Equityholders Pro Rata Share, the Equityholders Representative against
all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, obligations, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and the
amount of any judgment against them, of any nature whatsoever (including, but
not limited to, any and all expense whatsoever reasonably incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending against any litigation, commenced or
threatened or any claims whatsoever), arising out of or in connection with any
claim, investigation, challenge, action or proceeding or in connection with
any appeal thereof, relating to the acts or omissions of the Equityholders
Representative hereunder. The foregoing indemnification shall not apply in the
event of any action or proceeding which finally adjudicates the liability of
the Equityholders Representative hereunder for its gross negligence or
willful misconduct. In the event of any indemnification hereunder, upon
written notice from the Equityholders Representative to the Equityholder as
to the existence of a deficiency toward the payment of any such
indemnification amount, each Equityholder shall promptly deliver to the
Equityholders Representative full payment of its, his or her Pro Rata Share
of the amount of such deficiency.

 



 

10.4 _Other Provisions Relating to the Equityholders  Representative_.

 



 

(a) All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the
Equityholders Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Effective
Time and/or any termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to rely upon
all actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Equityholders Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, all of which actions or omissions shall be legally
binding upon the Equityholders. Neither Purchaser nor any Affiliate will have
any liability to any Equityholder, in each case arising out of the acts or
omissions of Equityholders Representative, any disputes among Equityholders
or with Equityholders Representative.

 



 

(c) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an interest
and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or
liquidation of any Equityholder and (ii) shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, and any action taken by the Equityholders Representative pursuant to
the authority granted in this Agreement shall be effective and absolutely
binding on each Equityholder notwithstanding any contrary action of or
direction from such Equityholder, except for actions or omissions of the
Equityholders Representative constituting gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

 



 

(d) Each of the Company, Merger Sub and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
the Equityholders Representative is a party to this Agreement solely to
perform certain administrative functions in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, each of the Company,
Merger Sub and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the Equityholders
Representative shall have no liability to, and shall not be liable for any
Losses of, any of the Company, Merger Sub or Purchaser or to any Purchaser
Indemnitee in connection with any obligations of the Equityholders
Representative under this Agreement or otherwise in respect of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent such Losses
shall be proven to be the direct result of gross

 



      
 

 



 

negligence or willful misconduct by the Equityholders Representative in
connection with the performance of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

[ _Signatures Appear on Following Page_ ]

 



       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Stockholders, Parent and the Equityholders Representative have caused this
Agreement to be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly
authorized, all as of the date first above written.
