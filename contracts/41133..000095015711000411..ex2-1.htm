ARTICLE 2

  

The Merger

  

  

Section 2.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
Connecticut Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation").

  

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 9, the closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, 450
Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, as soon as possible, but in any
event no later than two Business Days after the date the conditions set forth
in Article 9 (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of those conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the
extent permissible, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefit of
such conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other
date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree.

  

  

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Connecticut Secretary of the State and make all other
filings or recordings required by Connecticut Law in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "Effective Time")
as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Connecticut Secretary of
the State (or at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of
merger).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 33-820 of Connecticut Law.

  

  

Section 2.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

  

  

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(b), Section 2.02(c) or
Section 2.04, each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive (i) $11.00 in
cash, without interest (the "Cash Consideration"), and (ii) a Contingent Cash
Consideration Payment (together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger
Consideration");

  

  

(b) each share of Company Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned
by Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto;

  

  

(c) each share of Company Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company
or Parent (other than Merger Subsidiary) immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary
owns the same percentage of the Surviving Corporation immediately following
the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned of the Company immediately prior
to the Effective Time; and

  

  

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and, together
with the shares described in Section 2.02(c), shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint Computershare Trust Company, N.A., or if Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. is not willing to so act, another agent that is reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging
for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company
Stock (the "Certificates") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent,
as needed, the Cash Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates
and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no
event later than three Business Days after the Effective Time, Parent shall
send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of
Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of
the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

  

  

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share. Until so
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

  

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this Article 2.

  

  

(e) Any portion of the Cash Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of
Company Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.03 prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger
Consideration, in respect of such shares without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Stock immediately prior to such time
when such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) Any portion of the Cash Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.04 in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be returned
to Parent, upon demand.

  

  

Section 2.04. Dissenting Shares. If the stockholders of the Company are
entitled to appraisal rights under Connecticut Law, then, notwithstanding
Section 2.02, shares of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares of Company Stock canceled in
accordance with Section 2.02(b) and held by a holder who has not voted in
favor of approval of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who
has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with
Connecticut Law (such shares being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting
Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses such holder's appraisal rights under Connecticut Law with
respect to such shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of the appraised
value of such shares in accordance with Connecticut Law; provided that if,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise
loses such holder's right to appraisal pursuant to Connecticut Law, such
shares of Company Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of
the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with Section 2.02(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of
such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
shares of Company Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to Connecticut Law that relates to such demand, and Parent shall
have the opportunity and right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands under Connecticut Law consistent with
the obligations of the Company thereunder. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 2.05. Company Equity Awards. (a) At or immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Stock outstanding
under any Company Stock Plan (a "Company Stock Option") that has an exercise
price per share of Company Stock underlying such Company Stock Option (the
"Option Exercise Price") that is less than the Cash Consideration (each such
Company Stock Option, an "In-the-Money Company Stock Option"), whether or not
exercisable or vested, shall be converted into the right to receive, (i) an
amount in cash determined by multiplying (A) the excess of the Cash
Consideration over the Option Exercise Price of such In-the-Money Company
Stock Option by (B) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such In-
the-Money Company Stock Option (such amount, the "In-the-Money Company Stock
Option Cash Consideration") and (ii) a Contingent Cash Consideration Payment
for each share of Company Stock subject to such In-the-Money Company Stock
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay the In-the-Money Company Stock Option Cash
Consideration at or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no
event later than ten Business Days after the Effective Time). Contingent Cash
Consideration Payments in respect of In-the-Money Company Stock Options shall
be subject to the same terms and conditions as apply to Contingent Cash
Consideration Payments in respect of Company Stock generally.

  

  

(b) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option
that has an Option Exercise Price that is equal to or greater than the Cash
Consideration (each such Company Stock Option, an "Out-of-the-Money Company
Stock Option"), whether or not exercisable or vested, shall be converted into
the right to receive a Contingent Cash Consideration Payment for each share of
Company Stock subject to such Out-of-the-Money Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Contingent Cash Consideration
Payments in respect of Out-of-the-Money Company Stock Options shall be subject
to the same terms and conditions as apply to Contingent Cash Consideration
Payments in respect of Company Stock generally.

  

  

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each share of Company Stock
granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions under any Company Stock
Plan (each, a "Company Restricted Share") that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full and become free of such
restrictions as of the Effective Time and, at the Effective Time, shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 2.02(a) and under the same terms and conditions as apply to the
receipt of the Merger Consideration by holders of Company Stock generally.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each restricted share unit
with respect to shares of Company Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan
(each, a "Company RSU") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive (i) an amount in cash equal
to (A) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Cash
Consideration (such amount, the "Company RSU Cash Consideration") and (ii) a
Contingent Cash Consideration Payment for each share of Company Stock subject
to such Company RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to pay the Company RSU Cash Consideration at
or reasonably promptly after the Effective Time (but in no event later than
ten Business Days after the Effective Time). Contingent Cash Consideration
Payments in respect of Company RSUs shall be subject to the same terms and
conditions as apply to Contingent Cash Consideration Payments in respect of
Company Stock generally.

  

  

(e) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of any kind
consisting of shares of Company Stock that may be held, awarded, outstanding,
payable or reserved for issuance under any Company Stock Plan or other
Employee Plan or otherwise, other than Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Shares and Company RSUs (collectively, the "Company Awards"), shall
be converted into (i) an obligation of the Surviving Corporation to pay to the
holder of such Company Award an amount in cash equal to (A) the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (B) the Cash Consideration (such amount, the
"Company Award Cash Consideration") and (ii) the right of the holder of such
Company Award to receive a Contingent Cash Consideration Payment for each
share of Company Stock subject to such Company Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time. The Company Award Cash Consideration shall be paid or
distributed within ten Business Days following the earliest date which would
not result in adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code to the
holder of such Company Awards. Contingent Cash Consideration Payments in
respect of Company Awards shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as
apply to Contingent Cash Consideration Payments in respect of Company Stock
generally.

  

  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof administering any Company Stock Plan) shall
adopt such resolutions or take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting,
providing for the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.05. The Company
shall provide that, following the Effective Time, no holder of any Company
Stock Option, Company Restricted Share, Company RSU or Company Award shall
have the right to acquire any equity interest in the Company or the Surviving
Corporation in respect thereof.

  

  

(g) The holders of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company
RSUs and Company Awards shall have the right to enforce, and shall be
beneficiaries with respect to, the provisions of this Section 2.05.

Section 2.06. Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. If the
Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so
withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Stock,
Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company RSUs or Company
Awards, as applicable, in respect of which the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

  

  

Section 2.07. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated
by this Article 2.

incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (b) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 4.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a

Representations and Warranties of Parent

  

  

Parent represents and warrants to the Company that:

  

  

Section 5.01. Corporate Existence and Power. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all
corporate powers and all governmental licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals required to carry on its business as currently
conducted, except for those powers, licenses, authorizations, permits,
consents and approvals the absence of which would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent. Parent has heretofore made available to the Company complete and
correct copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary as currently in effect. Since the date of its incorporation,
each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and each wholly-owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary of Parent that is a direct or indirect parent of Merger Subsidiary
(each, a "Holdco") has not engaged in any activities other than in connection
with or as contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with arranging any
financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Parent
or any Holdco owns beneficially and of record all of the outstanding capital
stock of Merger Subsidiary and each Holdco.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

  

Section 5.02. Corporate Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance
by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby are
within the corporate powers of Parent and Merger Subsidiary and have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action. Assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary, enforceable against
each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary in accordance with its terms (subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general
principles of equity).

  

  

Section 5.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby require no action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority, other than (i) the filing of a certificate of merger with respect
to the Merger with the Connecticut Secretary of the State and appropriate
documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which Parent is
qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable requirements of
the HSR Act and Foreign Antitrust Laws, (iii) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the 1934 Act and any other state or federal securities laws,
(iv) compliance with any applicable rules of the NYSE, (v) any action or
filing to comply with the CTA and (vi) any actions or filings the absence of
which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

  

Section 5.04. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement, as applicable, and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby do not and will not (i) contravene, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, (ii) assuming compliance with the
matters referred to in Section 5.03, contravene, conflict with or result in a
violation or breach of any provision of any Applicable Law, (iii) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03, require any consent
or other action by any Person under, constitute a default, or an event that,
with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default,
under, or cause or permit the termination, cancellation, acceleration or other
change of any right or obligation or the loss of any benefit to which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any agreement or
other instrument binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or other similar
authorization by which any asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound
or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of each of clauses (ii)
through (iv), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

  

  

Section 5.05. Disclosure Documents. The information supplied by Parent or
Merger Subsidiary for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not, on the date
the Proxy Statement, and any amendments or supplements thereto, is first
mailed to the stockholders of the Company or at the time of the Company
Stockholder Approval, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.05 shall not apply
to statements or omissions included or incorporated by reference in the Proxy
Statement based upon information supplied by the Company or any of its
Representatives specifically for use or incorporation by reference therein.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

33  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 5.06. Financing. (a) Parent has delivered to the Company complete and
correct copies of (i) a fully executed commitment letter (the "Debt Commitment
Letter") from Fortress Credit Corp. confirming its commitment to provide
Parent with debt financing in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (the "Debt Financing") and (ii) fully executed commitment letters (the
"Equity Commitment Letters," and together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the
"Financing Commitment Letters") from each of the parties listed on Annex II
hereto confirming the respective counterparties' commitments to provide Parent
with equity financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(the "Equity Financing," and together with the Debt Financing, the
"Financing").

  

  

(b) The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and is a valid
and binding obligation of Parent and the other parties thereto. Each of the
Debt Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and is a valid and binding
obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties
thereto. Parent or Merger Subsidiary has fully paid any and all commitment or
other fees in connection with the Financing Commitment Letters that are
payable on or prior to the date hereof. As of the date hereof, none of the
Financing Commitment Letters have been amended or modified in any respect, no
such amendment or modification is contemplated and the respective commitments
contained therein have not been withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in
any respect. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected
to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary
or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other party thereto under any Financing
Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the
full amount of the Financing other than the conditions precedent set forth in
the Financing Commitment Letters, and Parent has no reason to believe that any
term or condition of closing of the Financing that is required to be satisfied
will not be satisfied, or that the Financing will not be made available to
Parent on the date of the Closing. As of the date hereof, there are no
Contracts to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party that contain any
Additional Financing Terms. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing are in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Merger upon the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and pay all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement.

  

  

Section 5.07. Limited Guaranty. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the duly executed Limited
Guaranty. The Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect and constitutes a
valid and binding obligation of each Guarantor, enforceable against each
Guarantor in accordance with its terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and other laws
affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of equity). No
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part
of any Guarantor under the Limited Guaranty.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

34  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 5.08. Solvency. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions set forth
in Sections 9.01 and 9.02, and after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Financing and the payment of the aggregate
Merger Consideration, (b) the accuracy of the representations and warranties
contained in Article 4, (c) the accuracy of the estimates, projections or
forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries made available to Parent, (c)
payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and (d) payment of all related fees
and expenses, the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective
Time and immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent," when used with
respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the
amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of
such date, exceed (A) the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are
generally determined in accordance with Applicable Law governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (B) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its existing debts
(including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and
mature, (ii) such Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged following such date and (iii) such Person will be
able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as
they mature.

  

  

Section 5.09. Certain Arrangements. There are no Contracts or commitments to
enter into Contracts upon terms agreed on or prior to the date hereof (a)
between Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Guarantors or any of their Affiliates,
on the one hand, and any director, officer or employee of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, or (b) pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to approve this Agreement or the
Merger or agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

  

  

Section 5.10. Ownership of Company Securities. Neither Parent nor Merger
Subsidiary nor any of their affiliates or associates (as defined in Section
33-843 of Connecticut Law) is the beneficial owner (as defined in Section
33-843 of Connecticut Law) of any Company Securities or Company Subsidiary
Securities or holds any rights to acquire any Company Securities or Company
Subsidiary Securities except pursuant to this Agreement.

until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Article 10, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit
any of its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission of any

Shop Period Start Date, (A) the Company shall, and shall cause any of its
Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause
to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations,
if any, with any Third Party and its Representatives conducted prior to the
date hereof with respect to any Acquisition Proposal and (B) the Company shall
promptly request that each such Third Party, if any, that has executed a
confidentiality agreement within the 12-month period prior to the date hereof
in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Third Party
by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No later than one
Business Day after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify
Parent in writing of (1) the identity of each Excluded Party, (2) the material
terms and conditions of such Excluded Party's Acquisition Proposal as of the

Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that an Acquisition Proposal received by
the Company or any of its Representatives from such Excluded Party prior to
the No-Shop Period Start Date constitutes a Superior Proposal.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Subject to Sections 6.03(d) and 6.03(e), the Board of Directors of the
Company shall not (i) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent the Company Board Recommendation (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal)
(any of the foregoing in this clause (i), an "Adverse Recommendation Change";
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, none of (A) the determination by
the Board of Directors that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, (B) the disclosure by the Company of such determination or (C) the
delivery by the Company of the notice required by the last sentence of Section
6.03(b) shall in and of themselves constitute an Adverse Recommendation
Change), or (ii) exempt any transaction from the requirements of Section
33-841 or 33-844 of Connecticut Law.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 6.03(b) or Section 6.03(c)
to the contrary, if at any time after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company or any of its
Representatives has received a written Acquisition Proposal from any Third
Party that the Board of Directors of the Company reasonably believes could
lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company, directly or indirectly through
its Representatives, may (i) engage in negotiations or discussions with such
Third Party and its Representatives and (ii) furnish to such Third Party or
its Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided
that the Company shall make available to Parent any material non-public
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that is made available
to such Third Party which was not previously made available to Parent prior to
or substantially concurrently with the time it is made available to such Third
Party.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, at
any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, the Board of Directors of the Company
may make an Adverse Recommendation Change; provided that, if the Company is
making an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to any fact, event,
change, development or set of circumstances other than an Acquisition Proposal
(which shall be governed by Section 6.03(h)), then the Board of Directors
shall not make such Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company has (i)
provided to Parent at least three Business Days' prior written notice that it
intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the facts
underlying the decision by the Board of Directors of the Company to take such
action and (ii) during such three Business Day period, if requested by Parent,
engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such
a manner that obviates the need for such Adverse Recommendation Change.

  

  

(f) In addition, nothing contained herein shall prevent the Board of Directors
of the Company from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the 1934 Act with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal; provided that any such action taken or statement made
that relates to an Acquisition Proposal shall not be deemed to be an Adverse
Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors of the Company reaffirms the
Company Board Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such
action or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with Applicable Law (including its fiduciary duties).

  

  

(g) From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, (i) the Company shall notify
Parent promptly (but in no event later than 36 hours) after receipt by the
Company (or any of its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal (other
than any Acquisition Proposal received from any Excluded Party), which notice
shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions
of, any such Acquisition Proposal and (ii) the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed promptly (but in no event later than 36 hours) after any
material developments, discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition
Proposal (other than any Acquisition Proposal received from any Excluded
Party) and shall provide to Parent promptly (but in no event later than 36
hours) after receipt thereof copies of all correspondence and other written
materials sent or provided to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
describe any material terms or conditions of any Acquisition Proposal (other
than any Acquisition Proposal received from any Excluded Party).

  

  

(h) Further, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to an Acquisition Proposal (or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(d)(i)), unless (i) the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company promptly notifies
Parent in writing, at least three Business Days before taking such action, of
the determination of the Board of Directors of the Company that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and of its intention to
take such action, attaching the most current version of the proposed agreement
under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the
identity of the Third Party making such Superior Proposal and (iii) the Board
of Directors of the Company (A) shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to this Agreement, the Financing Commitment Letters and the Limited
Guaranty proposed in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a binding
Contract if accepted by the Company and (B) shall have determined that such
Acquisition Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
revisions were to be given effect (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new written notification from the Company
and a new three Business Day period under this Section 6.03(h)).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(i) As used in this Agreement:

  


 

  

(i) "Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement" means a confidentiality agreement
that contains provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to the
Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement; provided that
such confidentiality agreement may contain a less restrictive or no standstill
restriction, in which case the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed to be
amended to contain only such less restrictive provision, or to omit such
provision, as applicable.

  


 

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal for
at least a majority of the outstanding shares of Company Stock or all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of the Company on terms that the
Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith by a majority vote,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, and
taking into account all relevant terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, including any conditions to consummation, the timing of the
transaction compared to the Merger and, if a cash transaction (whether in
whole or in part), whether financing is then fully committed or determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company to be available, is more
favorable and makes available greater aggregate value to the Company's
stockholders than the Merger (taking into account any proposal by Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.03(h)).

  

  

Section 6.04. Tax Matters. (a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make or change any Tax
election, change any annual tax accounting period, adopt or change any method
of tax accounting, file any material amended Tax Returns or claims for Tax
refunds, enter into any closing agreement, surrender any material Tax claim,
audit or assessment, surrender any right to claim a material Tax refund,
offset or other reduction in Tax liability, consent to any extension or waiver
of the limitations period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment or take or
omit to take any other action, if any such action or omission would have the
effect of materially increasing the Tax liability or reducing any Tax asset of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and is not in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice.

  

  

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall establish or cause to be
established in accordance with GAAP on or before the Effective Time an
adequate accrual for all Taxes due with respect to any period or portion
thereof ending prior to or as of the Effective Time.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added
and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with the Merger (including any real property transfer tax and
any similar Tax) shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation when due, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax
returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and,
if required by Applicable Law, the Surviving Corporation shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax returns and
other documentation.

  

  

Section 6.05. Access to Information; Restructuring. (a) From the date hereof
until the Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall (i) upon reasonable advance written notice from
Parent, give to Parent and its Representatives access during normal business
hours to the offices, properties, books and records of such party, (ii)
furnish to Parent and its Representatives such existing financial and
operating data and other existing information as such Persons may reasonably
request and (iii) instruct its Representatives to reasonably cooperate with
Parent in its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this Section
6.05(a) (A) shall not relate to the Restructuring (which is the subject of
Section 6.05(b)) and (B) shall be conducted under supervision of appropriate
personnel of the Company as reasonably necessary and in such manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business and ongoing operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the activities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to Section 6.03(a).

  

  

(b) (i) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, use
reasonable efforts to provide information reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with planning and preparation for the proposed restructuring (the
"Restructuring") of the Company to occur following the Closing that is
described in Section 6.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; provided that
(A) such provision of information does not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business and ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or the activities of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to
Section 6.03(a) and (B) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be
obligated to take any actions to implement any part of the Restructuring on or
prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(ii) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) incurred and documented by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with the provision of information by the Company and its
Subsidiaries contemplated by this Section 6.05(b) and shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the planning,
preparation or implementation of any part of the Restructuring.

  

  

(c) Each of the Company and Parent shall designate one or more representatives
(each, an "Access Representative") to coordinate access, information and
cooperation pursuant to this Section 6.05. Each and every request by Parent
for access, information or cooperation shall be made by Parent's Access
Representative to the Company's Access Representative (each such request, an
"Access Request"). Except for (i) any Access Request or (ii) any contact or
category of contact expressly permitted by the terms of an Access Request
approved by the Company's Access Representative, none of Parent and its
Representatives shall contact any of the Company or its Representatives.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, any of Parent or its Representatives
may contact the Company's outside legal counsel or financial advisor.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

43  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.05, neither the
Company nor its employees, counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other
authorized representatives shall be required to provide access, information or
cooperation to the extent (i) such access, information or cooperation includes
any valuation of the Company or (ii) the Company determines in good faith that
not providing such access, information or cooperation is necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements or other confidentiality obligations or
Applicable Law or to address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege
concerns.

  

  

Section 6.06. Financing Cooperation. (a) The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use their
reasonable best efforts to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to use their reasonable best efforts to, provide all
cooperation that is customary in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing as may be reasonably requested in writing by Parent (provided that

the business and ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries),
including (i) participation in a reasonable number of meetings, due diligence
sessions, lender presentations and sessions with rating agencies, (ii)
assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,

(iii) furnishing Parent and its Debt Financing sources with (A) such pertinent
and customary information (other than financial information), to the extent
reasonably available to the Company, regarding the Company and its

the Debt Financing and (B) historical audited and unaudited financial
statements as filed with the SEC, financial data as may be reasonably

ARTICLE 7

  

Covenants of Parent

  

  

Parent agrees that:

  

  

Section 7.01. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall take all action
necessary to cause Merger Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

  

  

Section 7.02. Voting of Shares. Parent shall vote or cause to be voted all
shares of Company Stock beneficially owned by it or any of its Subsidiaries in
favor of approval of this Agreement at the Company Stockholder Meeting.

  

  

Section 7.03. Indemnification and Insurance. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do the following:

  

  

(a) For at least six years following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former officers
and directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified
Person") in respect of acts or omissions in their capacities as officers,
directors, employees or agents (including fiduciaries with respect to employee
benefit plans) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions with respect to the
adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby) to the fullest extent permitted by Connecticut Law or any
other Applicable Law.

  

  

(b) For at least six years following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect provisions in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries (or in such
documents of any successor to the business of the Surviving Corporation or any
of its Subsidiaries) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and
advancement of expenses that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in
existence on the date of this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time,
any agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries regarding elimination of liability, indemnification or
advancement of expenses shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation, shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, or if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancelable extension of
the directors' and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing
directors' and officers' insurance policies and the Company's existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period or time at or prior to the Effective Time (including claims with
respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Company's existing policies; provided that the Company shall give
Parent a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of such "tail"
insurance policy and the Company shall give good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent with respect thereto; and provided that the total
amount payable for such "tail" insurance policy shall not exceed 250% of the
amount per annum payable by the Company for its current fiscal year (which
amount is set forth in Section 7.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule)
(such maximum amount, the "Maximum Tail Premium") and if the total amount
payable for such "tail" insurance policy exceeds the Maximum Tail Premium,
then the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a total amount payable not exceeding the Maximum Tail Premium.

  

  

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys assets
equal to 50% or more of the consolidated assets of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or to which 50% or more of the consolidated revenues or earnings
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation are attributable or 50% or more of any
class of equity or voting securities of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the applicable successor, assign or transferee shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.03 (including this Section 7.03(d));
provided that, in the case of a transfer pursuant to clause (ii),
notwithstanding such assumption, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
remain obligated under this Section 7.03.

  

  

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.03 shall be in
addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under
Connecticut Law or any other Applicable Law, under any agreement of any
Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise.
These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. The obligations
of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.03 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of
any Indemnified Person without the consent of such Indemnified Person.

  

  

Section 7.04. Employee Matters. (a) Until April 30, 2012, with respect to
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective
Time ("Company Employees") who continue with the Surviving Corporation, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide compensation and
employee benefits to each Company Employee that, taken as a whole, have a
value that is substantially comparable in the aggregate (excluding any value
attributable to equity-based compensation and frozen defined benefits plans)
to those provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided that, following April 30, 2012, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, in consultation with the Surviving Corporation's then
management, review the compensation and employee benefits provided to
employees of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (including the
Company Employees) in a manner consistent with which the Company reviewed such
compensation and employee benefits prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.04(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
assume, honor and continue until April 30, 2012 or, if sooner, until all
obligations thereunder have been satisfied, all of the Company's change-in-
control, employment, severance, retention and termination plans, policies,
programs, agreements and arrangements set forth in Section 7.04(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, in each case, as in effect at the Effective
Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in
combination with any other event), without any amendment or modification,
other than any amendment or modification required to comply with Applicable
Law or with the consent of the applicable Company Employee; provided that,
following April 30, 2012, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, in
consultation with the Surviving Corporation's then management, review the
Surviving Corporation's severance, retention and termination plans, policies,
programs and arrangements in a manner consistent with which the Company
reviewed such plans, policies, programs and arrangements prior to the
Effective Time.

  

  

(c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates
(including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes,
including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting,
benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies, each Company Employee's
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with
any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such
Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates; provided, however, that such service need not be recognized to the
extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

  

  

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates in which Company Employees (and their
eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the
Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Employee Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall
recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-payments,
deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or
her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time
occurs for purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and co-payment
limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be
eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time.

  

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.06, nothing in this Section
7.04 shall create any right in any Person, including any employees, former
employees, any participant in any Employee Plan or any beneficiary thereof,
nor create any right to continued employment with Parent, Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates.

  

  

Section 7.05. Financing. (a) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Financing Commitment Letters, and shall not enter
into any Contract that contains Additional Financing Terms (other than an
amendment or modification of the Financing Commitment Letters that is
permitted by this Section 7.05), and shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision under, the
Financing Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification or waiver (i)
reduces (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of the
Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount unless (A) the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing is
increased by a corresponding amount and (B) after giving effect to any of the
transactions referred to in clause (A) above, the representation and warranty
set forth in Section 5.08 shall be true) or (ii) imposes new or additional
conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the conditions to
the Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any other provision of
the Financing Commitment Letters in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to (A) delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or
satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the date of the Closing or
(B) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Financing Commitment Letters (provided
that, subject to compliance with the other provisions of this Section 7.05,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary may amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add
additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners and agents). Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement.

  

  

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use its reasonable best efforts
(i) to maintain in full force and effect the Financing Commitment Letters,
(ii) to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the
Debt Commitment Letters on the terms and conditions contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters (or on terms no less favorable to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary than the terms and conditions in the Debt Commitment Letters),
(iii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding in the Debt
Commitment Letters and such definitive agreements thereto and in the Equity
Commitment Letter and to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing,
including using its reasonable best efforts (including, with respect to the
Debt Financing sources, through litigation pursued in good faith) to cause the
lenders and the other persons committing to fund the Financing to fund the
Financing at the Closing, (iv) to enforce its rights (including, with respect
to the Debt Financing sources, through litigation pursued in good faith) under
the Financing Commitment Letters and (v) to comply with its obligations under
the Financing Commitment Letters. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing and provide to the Company copies of the material
definitive agreements for the Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give the Company prompt
notice (A) of any breach or default by any party to any of the Financing
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of which
Parent or Merger Subsidiary becomes aware, (B) of the receipt of (x) any
written notice or (y) other written communication, in each case from any
Financing source with respect to any (1) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Commitment
Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of
the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties
to any of the Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to
the Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the
amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing and (C) if at any time for any
reason Parent or Merger Subsidiary believes in good faith that it will not be
able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and
conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the
Financing Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing. As promptly as practicable, but in any event within two Business
Days of the date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Subsidiary a written
request therefor, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the immediately preceding sentence. Upon the
occurrence of any circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B) or (C) of the
second preceding sentence or if any portion of the Debt Financing otherwise
becomes unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund an amount
sufficient to consummate the Merger upon the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and pay all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and their respective Representatives pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain in replacement thereof alternative financing from alternative sources
in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
to the extent possible with other terms and conditions not materially less
favorable to Parent and Merger Subsidiary (or their Affiliates) than the terms
and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and in any event with
terms and conditions that are reasonably likely to be satisfied to permit the
closing of the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Parent shall deliver to
the Company complete and correct copies of all commitment letters and material
definitive agreements pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have
committed to provide any portion of the Debt Financing. Parent and Merger
Subsidiary acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Financing, or any
alternative financing, is not a condition to Closing.

and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the arrangement of,
obtaining the commitment to provide or obtaining any financing for such

Merger Subsidiary would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the
Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay any amount due to
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section 11.04, it
shall also pay any costs and expenses incurred by the other party in
connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement that results in a
judgment against the paying party for such amount, together with interest on
the amount of any unpaid fee, cost or expense at the publicly announced prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such fee, cost or expense was required to

payment of an amount equal to the Parent Termination Fee from Parent or the
Guarantors pursuant to the Limited Guaranty in respect thereof shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries and stockholders
against Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Guarantors and any of their respective
former, current and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling
persons, stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates,
members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees (collectively, the
"Parent Related Parties") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of
the Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
(whether intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or otherwise and (ii)
upon payment of such amount none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, but subject to Parent's rights set forth in
Section 11.04(e) and 11.13, (A) Parent's right to receive payment from the
Company of an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee pursuant to Section
11.04(b) and, if applicable, the Parent Expenses pursuant to Section 11.04(d)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Related Parties against
the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current
and future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling persons,
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members,
managers, general or limited partners or assignees (collectively, "Company
Related Parties") for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder
(whether intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or otherwise and (B)
upon payment of such amount(s), none of the Company Related Parties shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt,
(1) under no circumstances will the Parent Related Parties be liable for
monetary damages in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee (and
any amounts payable to the Company pursuant to Sections 6.05(b)(ii), 6.06(b)
and 11.04(e)) whether to the Company or any other Company Related Party and
(2) while the Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in
accordance with Section 11.13 and the payment of the Parent Termination Fee
under Section 11.04(c), under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and money damages,
including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.

be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes
of) (a) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of
the Company that are contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement
and (b) any other representations and warranties (or covenants) of the Company
that are contained in this Agreement if the relevance of such reference as an
exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and
warranties (or covenants) is reasonably apparent on its face.

  

  

Section 11.06. Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. (a) The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except as provided in Article 2 and Section 7.03, no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  

  

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer, by operation of law
or otherwise, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without
the consent of each other party hereto, except that Parent or Merger
Subsidiary may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of its
Affiliates at any time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person;
provided that such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger
Subsidiary of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any
obligation of any other party hereto or due to Parent or Merger Subsidiary.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this 
 Section 11.06(b) shall be null and void.

Section 11.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with (a) the laws of the State of Connecticut with
respect to matters, issues and questions relating to the duties of the Board
of Directors of the Company or Merger Subsidiary or to general corporation law
including requirements for the validity of the Merger and (b) the laws of the
State of Delaware with respect to all other matters, issues and questions,
without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of
Delaware.

  

  

Section 11.08. Jurisdiction. The parties hereto agree that any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether brought by any party or any of its Affiliates or against any
party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought in the Delaware Chancery
Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action
or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. The parties hereto
agree that a final trial court judgment in any such suit, action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law; provided, however, that
nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-
judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court
judgment.

  

  

Section 11.09. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

  

  

Section 11.10. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

Section 11.11. Entire Agreement; No Other Representations and Warranties. (a)
This Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Equity Commitment Letter and the Limited
Guaranty, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to
the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 4, each
of Parent and Merger Subsidiary acknowledges that neither the Company nor any
Person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information made available to Parent
or Merger Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor any other Person will have or be subject to
any liability or indemnification obligation to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or
any other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, or Parent's or Merger Subsidiary's use of, any such information,
including any information, documents, projections, forecasts or other material
made available to Parent or Merger Subsidiary in certain "data rooms" or
management presentations in expectation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, unless, and then only to the extent that, any such information
is expressly included in a representation or warranty contained in Article 4.

  

  

(c) Except for the representations and warranties contained in Article 5, the
Company acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any other
Person on behalf of Parent or Merger Subsidiary makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or Merger Subsidiary
or with respect to any other information made available to the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

Section 11.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

  

  

Section 11.13. Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take
such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the
immediately following sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
described in Section 11.08 without proof of damages or otherwise, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this
Agreement, (b) the provisions set forth in Section 11.04(i) are not intended
to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a
breach of this Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or
otherwise impair in any respect any party's right to specific enforcement and
(c) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
it is explicitly agreed that the right of the Company to seek an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing
Parent's obligation to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the
Merger (but not the right of the Company to such injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable remedies for obligations other than with
respect to the Equity Financing) shall be subject to the requirements that (i)
the conditions set forth in Sections 9.01 and 9.02 (other than conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied on the
date the Closing should have been consummated pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) the
Debt Financing (including any alternative financing that has been obtained in
accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section 7.05) has been
funded in accordance with the terms thereof or will be funded in accordance
with the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed that if the Equity
Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions that
are within its control to cause the Closing to occur. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief on the basis that the other parties
hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section
11.13 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. If, prior to the End Date, any
party brings any suit, action or proceeding, in each case in accordance with
Section 11.08, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, the End Date shall automatically
be extended by (A) the amount of time during which such suit, action or
proceeding is pending, plus 20 Business Days or (B) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such suit, action or proceeding, as
the case may be.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual agreements herein,
the Company, the initial Committee Members and the Paying Agent hereby agree
as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 

  


 ESCROW

  

  

SECTION 1.01. Escrow Account. (a) Simultaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Paying Agent shall establish the Escrow
Account to hold all funds accepted or held by the Paying Agent pursuant to
this Agreement. No funds shall be released from the Escrow Account, except in
accordance with this Agreement.

  

  

(b) Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Paying Agent for
deposit into the Escrow Account, an amount in cash equal to the Reimbursable
Funding Amount less an amount equal to the Pre-Closing Expenses.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, an amount in cash equal to
the Pre-Closing Recoveries Amount, if any, to the Paying Agent for deposit
into the Escrow Account.

  

  

(d) Promptly upon (and in no event later than five Business Days after)
receipt thereof, the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, an
amount in cash equal to each of the Recoveries to the Paying Agent for deposit
into the Escrow Account.

  

  

SECTION 1.02. Investment; Earnings Account. (a) The Paying Agent shall invest
the Escrow Assets as directed in writing by the Committee, solely in the
following: (i) obligations issued by the United States of America or any
agency or instrumentality thereof with a maturity of not more than 365 days
and (ii) money market funds substantially all of whose funds are invested in
the foregoing.

  

  

(b) All Earnings shall be paid into a sub-account of the Escrow Account (the
"Earnings Account") and the Paying Agent shall reinvest such Earnings in the
same manner as the Escrow Assets are directed to be invested by the Committee
pursuant to Section 1.02(a).

  

  

(c) If at any time the Committee deems it necessary that some or all of the
investments constituting Escrow Assets or Earnings be redeemed or sold in
order to raise cash proceeds necessary to comply with the provisions of this
Agreement, the Committee shall direct the Paying Agent to effect such
redemption or sale, in such manner and at such time as the Committee directs.

  

  

SECTION 1.03. Escrow Expenses. The Paying Agent shall (a) disburse such
portion of the Escrow Assets or Earnings as directed in writing by the
Committee to pay Escrow Expenses and (b) maintain a record of such
disbursements; provided that all Escrow Expenses shall be paid out of the
Escrow Assets until such time as the Escrow Assets are exhausted before any
Escrow Expenses shall be paid out of Earnings.

  

  

SECTION 1.04. Escrow Funding. Following the initial funding of the
Reimbursable Funding Amount pursuant to Section 1.01(b), the Committee may
request that the Company deliver additional funds into the Escrow Assets, in
such amounts as it shall request, subject to the following: (a) the Committee
may not request additional funds unless the Escrow Assets are valued at less
than $250,000 at the time of the Committee's request, (b) the Committee may
not request an amount of additional funds that would result in the Escrow
Assets being valued at more than $500,000 immediately following delivery of
such additional funds and (c) in no event shall the Company be required to
provide additional funds after the Transition Date or to the extent that the
aggregate additional funding pursuant to this Section 1.04, when taken
together with the initial funding of the Reimbursable Funding Amount pursuant
to Section 1.01(b), would exceed the Reimbursable Funding Amount Cap. The
Company shall promptly deliver, or cause to be delivered, the amounts
requested under, and subject to the conditions of, this Section 1.04 to the
Paying Agent in cash, and the Reimbursable Funding Amount shall be increased
to reflect such additional funding. For the avoidance of doubt, any amounts
deducted from Recoveries pursuant to Section 4.05 shall not serve to increase
the Reimbursable Funding Amount Cap.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

A-2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 1.05. Tax Treatment of Escrow. The Company shall be treated as the
owner of the Escrow Account for tax purposes.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  


 CCCPs

  

  

SECTION 2.01. No Certificates. The CCCPs shall not be evidenced by a
certificate or other instrument.

  

  

SECTION 2.02. Registration by the Paying Agent. (a) The Committee, the Company
and the Paying Agent may deem and treat the registered holder (the "Holder")
of a CCCP as the absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and none of the
Committee, the Company and the Paying Agent shall be affected by any notice to
the contrary.

  

  

(b) The Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Paying Agent in
such form as the Company receives from its transfer agent (or other agent
performing similar services for the Company), the names and addresses of the
Holders within five Business Days of the Effective Time.

  

  

(c) The Company shall cause to be kept at the Paying Agent's principal office
a register (the "CCCP Register") in which the Paying Agent shall provide for
the registration of the CCCPs. The CCCPs shall be registered in the names and
addresses of, and in the denomination as set forth in, the applicable letter
of transmittal accompanying the shares of Company Stock surrendered by the
holder thereof in connection with the Merger pursuant to the Merger Agreement.
A Holder may make a written request to the Paying Agent or the Company to
change such Holder's address of record on the CCCP Register. The written
request must be duly executed by the Holder. Upon receipt of such written
request by the Paying Agent or the Company, the Paying Agent shall promptly
record the change of address on the CCCP Register. The Paying Agent shall
provide a copy of the CCCP Register to the Company upon request.

  

  

SECTION 2.03. Rights of CCCP Holder. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be construed as conferring upon any Holder, by virtue of being a Holder of a
CCCP, the right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as stockholders in
respect of the meetings of stockholders or the election of directors of the
Company or any other matter, or any rights of any kind or nature whatsoever as
a stockholder of the Company, either at law or in equity. The rights of a
Holder are limited to those expressed in this Agreement.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

A-3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 2.04. Non-transferability. The CCCPs and any interest therein
(including beneficial ownership through a broker, dealer, custodian bank or
other nominee) shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered
or in any other manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part,
directly or indirectly, other than through a Permitted Transfer and, in the
case of a Permitted Transfer, only in accordance with Section 2.05. Each
Holder, by virtue of its acceptance of a CCCP, shall be deemed to have agreed
to not sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or in any other manner
transfer or dispose of, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, such CCCP
or any interest therein other than through a Permitted Transfer in accordance
with Section 2.05. In addition, each Holder, by virtue of its acceptance of a
CCCP, shall be deemed to have agreed to not facilitate or recognize any
attempt by any beneficial owner of such CCCP, including any former street
holder of Company Stock or any broker, dealer, custodian bank or other nominee
of such a street holder to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, encumber or in any
other manner transfer or dispose of, in whole or in part, directly or
indirectly, an interest in such CCCP other than through a Permitted Transfer.
A "Permitted Transfer" shall mean (a) the transfer of a CCCP (or any interest
therein) on death by will or intestacy; (b) transfer by instrument to an inter
vivos or testamentary trust in which the CCCP (or any interest therein) is to
be passed to beneficiaries upon the death of the trustee; (c) transfers made
pursuant to a court order of a court of competent jurisdiction (such as in
connection with divorce, bankruptcy or liquidation); (d) if the Holder (or
beneficial owner of a CCCP) is a partnership or limited liability company, a
distribution by the transferring partnership or limited liability company to
its partners or members, as applicable; or (e) a transfer made by operation of
law (such as a merger).

  


 

  

SECTION 2.05. Transfer of CCCPs. (a) Subject to the restrictions on
transferability set forth in Section 2.04, the Paying Agent shall, from time
to time, register the transfer of any outstanding CCCPs upon the CCCP
Register, upon delivery to the Paying Agent of a written instrument or
instruments of transfer and other requested documentation in a form
satisfactory to the Company and the Paying Agent, duly executed by the
registered Holder or Holders thereof or by the duly appointed legal
representative thereof or by a duly authorized attorney, such signature to be
guaranteed by a participant in a recognized Signature Guarantee Medallion
Program. A request for a transfer of a CCCP shall be accompanied by such
documentation establishing satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
2.04 as may be reasonably requested by the Company (including opinions of
counsel, if appropriate). Upon receipt of documentation reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, the Company shall authorize the Paying Agent to
permit the transfer of a CCCP. The Paying Agent shall not permit the transfer
of a CCCP until it is so authorized by the Company. No transfer of a CCCP
shall be valid until registered on the CCCP Register and any transfer not duly
registered on the CCCP Register will be void ab initio. All transfers of CCCPs
registered on the CCCP Register shall be the valid obligations of the Company,
representing the same rights to receive cash as the CCCPs transferred
previously entitled the transferor to receive, and shall entitle the
transferee to the same benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held
by the transferor prior to such transfer. The CCCP Register will show one
position for Cede and Co (as nominee of DTC) which represents all the shares of
Company Stock held by DTC on behalf of the street holders of the shares of
Company Stock as of the Effective Time and the Paying Agent will have no
responsibility whatsoever directly to the street holders with respect to
Permitted Transfers. With respect to any payments to be made under Article V
below, the Paying Agent will accomplish the payment to the street holders by
sending one lump payment to DTC, who will then be required to distribute the
payments to brokers and stockholders as of the Effective Time. The Paying
Agent will have no responsibilities whatsoever with regards to distribution of
payments to the street holders directly.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

A-4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer of CCCPs.
The Paying Agent shall have no duty or obligation to take any action under
this Section which requires the payment by a Holder of a CCCP of applicable
taxes or charges unless and until the Paying Agent is satisfied that all such
taxes and charges have been paid.

  

  

ARTICLE III

  


 CCCP COMMITTEE

  

  

SECTION 3.01. Establishment. Each Holder, by virtue of its acceptance of a
CCCP, shall be deemed to have consented and agreed to (i) the establishment of
a CCCP Committee (the "Committee"), consisting of four members ("Committee
Members") and having the powers, authority and rights set forth in this
Agreement and (ii) the appointment of [●], [●] and [●] as the initial
Committee Members appointed by the Holders (the initial "Specified Committee
Members") and the appointment of [●] as the initial Committee Member appointed
by the Company (the initial "Company Committee Member").

  

  

SECTION 3.02. Authority. (a) Subject to Section 3.03, the Committee shall have
full power and authority to prosecute, appeal, negotiate, resolve, settle,
compromise or otherwise pursue any Claims, in whole or in part, on behalf and
in the name of the Company, in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, including by litigation in trial or appellate courts, arbitration,
alternative dispute resolution, negotiation, settlement or compromise
(collectively, the "Pursuit" of Claims), including such power and authority to
(i) initiate any Claims (including determining the timing thereof and the
strategy therefor) (A) against any of the Permissible Parties (any such
Claims, "Permitted Claims") and (B) otherwise with the unanimous approval of
the Committee Members (including the Company Committee Member)(any such
Claims, "Other Claims"), (ii) direct and supervise all matters involving
litigation of any Claims (including trial strategy and planning and settlement
strategy), (iii) appear before and conduct affairs with arbitrators, mediators
and other such professionals on behalf and in the name of the Company
necessary or appropriate to enable the Committee to Pursue any Claims, (iv)
appear in court and file pleadings and execute any documents on behalf and in
the name of the Company necessary or appropriate to enable the Committee to
Pursue any Claims and (v) agree to the settlement or compromise of any Claim,
including the grant of any Permitted License in connection therewith, subject
to the consent right set forth in Section 4.04; provided that the Committee
shall keep the Company Member reasonably informed of any material developments
in, and consult with the Company Member prior to making any material decisions
with respect to, the Pursuit of any Claims.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

A-5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) The Committee shall have full power and authority to withdraw all or part
of any Claims and terminate the Pursuit thereof.

  

  

(c) The Committee shall have full power and authority to retain advisors,
including counsel, accountants, financial advisors, experts, consultants,
investigators and other agents (collectively, "Advisors"), in connection with
the Pursuit of Claims or the withdrawal or termination thereof and to advise
the Committee Members with respect to the rights and obligations of the
parties under this Agreement, including such power and authority to (i) direct
and supervise all such Advisors (including Outside Counsel in all matters
contemplated by the Retainer Letter) and (ii) determine the amount and method
of compensation to be paid to such Advisors (including the settlement of any
disputes regarding such compensation); provided that the Committee shall
obtain the acknowledgment of each Advisor retained after the date hereof that
the sole recourse for such Advisor's fees and expenses shall be (A) first to
the Escrow Assets until such time as the Escrow Assets are exhausted or
finally distributed to the Holders pursuant to Article V and (B) then to the
Earnings until the Earnings are exhausted. The Company shall not pay any fees
or expenses of any such Advisor (including Outside Counsel pursuant to the
Retainer Letter) without the prior approval of the Committee.

  

  

(d) The Committee shall have full power and authority to direct the investment
of the Escrow Assets and Earnings, subject to Section 1.02, and the payment of
the Escrow Expenses and Escrow Payouts by the Paying Agent, including such
power and authority to determine the timing and amount of any interim Escrow
Payouts prior to the Claims End Date. Without limiting the generality of the
Committee's authority, prior to the Claims End Date, the Committee may
determine that all or a portion of any Recoveries should be retained in the
Escrow Account to fund Pursuit of additional Claims rather than included in an
interim Escrow Payout prior to the Claims End Date.

  

  

(e) The Committee shall have full power and authority to take such action as
the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to enforce the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement. If a court of competent jurisdiction renders a
final non-appealable judgment against the Company in respect of any suit
brought by the Committee to enforce the obligations of the Company under this
Agreement, then the Company agrees to pay all legal fees and expenses that the
Committee may reasonably incur (which may include any reasonable contingency
fees) as a result of any litigation commenced by the Committee regarding the
validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this
Agreement binding upon the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement, legal fees and expenses paid by the Company pursuant to this
Section 3.02(e) shall not be reimbursable to the Company.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

A-6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 3.03. Other Claims. At any time after the Committee elects to Pursue
any Other Claim, the Company may elect, by written notice to the Committee, to
control the Pursuit of such Other Claim, in which case the Company shall have
the power and authority to Pursue such Other Claim as if it were the Committee
under Sections 3.02(a), 3.02(b) and 3.02(c) (excluding the proviso of the
first sentence and the second sentence thereof) and to hire Advisors of its
choosing; provided that (a) the Committee shall have the power and authority
to retain its own Advisors in respect of the Pursuit of such Other Claim and
to pay any fees and expenses of such Advisors as Escrow Expenses, (b) the
Company shall keep the Committee reasonably informed of any material
developments in, and consult with the Committee prior to making any material
decisions with respect to, the Pursuit of such Other Claim, (c) the Company
shall not use Escrow Assets or Earnings to Pursue such Other Claim and (d) the
Company shall not amend the Retainer Letter or any other arrangement with an
Advisor in respect of any Claim, other than Other Claims it has elected to
control.

  

  

SECTION 3.04. Actions. The Committee may act only with the concurrence of a
majority of the Committee Members; provided, however, that the Committee may,
by resolution adopted by a majority of the Committee Members, designate a
Chairman or other Committee Member to act as the administrative Committee
Member and delegate to the Chairman or such other Committee Member such
authority as the Committee may determine and provided further that any
election to Pursue any Other Claim may be made only with the unanimous
approval of the Committee Members.

  

  

SECTION 3.05. Compensation. Each Committee Member is entitled to compensation
for service as a Committee Member as set forth in Exhibit A.

  

  

SECTION 3.06. Replacement of Committee Members. (a) Any Specified Committee
Member may be removed for cause only at any time upon the written election of
the Holders of not less than a majority of the then outstanding CCCPs. Any
Company Committee Member may be removed at any time upon written notice by the
Company.

  

  

(b) If any Specified Committee Member shall be removed, resign, die or become
incapacitated or shall otherwise become unable or unwilling to act as a
Committee Member hereunder, the two remaining Specified Committee Members
shall appoint a successor, or, if there is only one remaining Specified
Committee Member, such remaining Specified Committee Member shall appoint two
successor Specified Committee Members, or, if there are no remaining Specified
Committee Members, the Company shall appoint three successor Specified
Committee Members at least one of whom is an attorney experienced in
intellectual property litigation and none of whom are employees or Affiliates
of the Company or any of its Affiliates. If any Company Committee Member shall
be removed, resign, die or become incapacitated or shall otherwise become
unable or unwilling to act as a Committee Member hereunder, the Company shall
appoint a successor Company Committee Member. Every successor appointed under
this Section 3.05(b) shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and
the Paying Agent an instrument accepting such appointment and a joinder to
this Agreement, and thereupon such successor shall be vested with the same
powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named
as the Committee Member such successor is succeeding without further act or
deed.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

A-7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Any Committee Member may also be a Holder or an officer, director,
employee or Affiliate of a Holder and in such case will continue to have all
the rights of a Holder to the same extent as if he or she were not a Committee
Member.

  

  

SECTION 3.07. Liability; Indemnification. (a) Each Committee Member undertakes
to perform only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement
and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement
against any Committee Member. No Committee Member shall be liable, responsible
or accountable in damages or otherwise for any Loss (including Losses that are
costs and expenses of defense of claims, as incurred) incurred by reason of
having been a Committee Member or resulting from administration of any Claims
or the Escrow Account or any decision, action or failure to act, except to the
extent that any such Loss shall have been finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to have been primarily caused by the bad faith or
willful misconduct of such Committee Member. Each Holder, by virtue of its
acceptance of a CCCP, shall be deemed to have consented and agreed to release
and forever discharge each Committee Member from and against any and all
liabilities, responsibilities and claims for damages or otherwise for any Loss
incurred by reason of having been a Committee Member or resulting from
administration of any Claims or the Escrow Account or any decision, action or
failure to act, except to the extent that any such Loss shall have been
finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been primarily
caused by the bad faith or willful misconduct of such Committee Member.

  

  

 

(b) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Committee Member
against any Loss incurred by reason of having been a Committee Member or
resulting from administration of any Claims or the Escrow Account or any
decision, action or failure to act, except to the extent that any such Loss
shall have been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to
have been primarily caused by the bad faith or willful misconduct of such
Committee Member. The Company shall advance payments in connection with its
indemnification obligations under this Section 3.07(b) upon request of any
Committee Member; provided that such Committee Member shall have delivered to
the Company a written undertaking to repay any amount advanced in the event it
is subsequently determined in a final non-appealable judgment rendered by a
court of competent jurisdiction that such Loss was primarily caused by the bad
faith or willful misconduct of such Committee Member. The rights of each
Committee Member under this Section 3.07(b) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to which such Committee Member may be
entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise. These rights are
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Committee Member. The
obligations of the Company under this Section 3.07(b) shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any
Committee Member without the consent of such Committee Member and shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and the removal or resignation of
any Committee Member.

  

  

 

  

 

 

 

  

 

A-8  

  

 

 

 

  

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding Section 3.07(b), all Losses indemnified pursuant to
Section 3.07(b) (including amounts advanced pursuant to the second sentence
thereof) shall be deemed to be Escrow Expenses and shall be paid out (i) first
from the Escrow Assets until such time as the Escrow Assets are exhausted or
finally distributed to the Holders pursuant to Article V and (ii) then from
the Earnings until the Earnings are exhausted, before the Company shall be
obligated to make any payments pursuant to Section 3.07(b); provided that
should any Claim Proceeds be received after the Company has made any payments
pursuant to Section 3.07(b) due to exhaustion of the Escrow Assets and
Earnings, the Company shall be entitled to reimbursement of an amount in cash
equal to such payments from such Claim Proceeds.

  

 

  

ARTICLE IV 
 

  

CERTAIN COVENANTS

  

  

SECTION 4.01. Cooperation. (a) The Company shall (i) provide the Committee and
its Advisors with such access as the Committee reasonably deems necessary to
Pursue the Claims, at normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to the
Company's books and records (including electronic and archived documents and
files) and the Company's facilities and to current employees and Advisors of
the Company, including in connection with testimony in litigation and factual
investigation, and (ii) make its employees and Advisors available to provide
assistance and expertise at such times and in such places, including in
connection with depositions conducted outside the United States, as the

the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), the Company only shall be required
to provide such access and make its employees and Advisors available to the
extent and in such manner as does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company shall cooperate
and render assistance in obtaining such access as the Committee reasonably
deems necessary to Pursue the Claims to former employees and Advisors of the
Company, including in connection with testimony in litigation and factual
investigation, provided that the Company only shall be required to provide
such cooperation and assistance to the extent and in such manner as does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by current or former
employees or Advisors of the Company (but in no event any compensation
expenses of current employees of the Company) in connection with the
Committee's access to them shall be reimbursed as Escrow Expenses.

  

  

(b) The Company shall (i) maintain in place any litigation document retention
policies that exist as of the Effective Time and (ii) implement and maintain

consent of the Committee, in the name of the Company and without further
consent or action by the Company or its Affiliates.

  

  

SECTION 4.03. Pursuit of Claims. The Company and its Affiliates shall not take

Claims. The Company and its Affiliates shall not disclose any non-public
information with respect to any Claims to any third parties except (i) to
Advisors of the Company and its Affiliates who are advised of the confidential
nature of such information and agree to abide by this Section 4.03 in respect
of such non-public information, (ii) to the extent such disclosure is
compelled by any governmental authority or applicable law or (iii) to the
extent such information becomes part of the public domain without breach of
this Section 4.03 by the Company or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

SECTION 4.04. Settlements. (a) No settlement or compromise of any Permitted
Claim or any Other Claim Pursued by the Committee shall require any consent or
action by the Company or its Affiliates, unless such settlement or compromise
would result in (i) the payment of any amount in cash by the Company, (ii) the
creation of a material ongoing obligation of the Company and its Affiliates or
(iii) a materially adverse admission of fact regarding the Company and its
Affiliates, other than the granting of a Permitted License. If the consent of
the Company shall be so required, such consent, including any release by the
Company or its Affiliates as may be required by the other party to such
settlement or compromise in connection with such settlement or compromise,
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  

  

(b) The settlement or compromise of any Other Claim Pursued by the Company
shall be subject to the consent of the Committee, such consent not to be

shall be required in connection with (i) any settlement or compromise of such
Other Claim in connection with the settlement or compromise of any claim,
cross-claim or counterclaim against the Company, or (ii) the withdrawal of all
or part of such Other Claim and termination of the Pursuit thereof, in each
case, not involving receipt of any consideration (other than such settlement
or compromise) by the Company.

entitled to deduct from any Claim Proceeds received after the Effective Time
in respect of Permitted Claims (any such Claim Proceeds, "Post-Closing
Permitted Claim Proceeds") the following amounts prior to depositing the
balance of such Post-Closing Permitted Claim Proceeds into the Escrow Account:
