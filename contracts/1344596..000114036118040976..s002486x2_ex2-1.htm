It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to <u>Section 7.1</u>, subject to this <u>Section 8.13</u>, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including the obligation of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger if such party is required to do so hereunder, including the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under <u>Section 5.16(d)</u>, and including the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to fully enforce the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter against the Sponsor to the fullest extent permissible under this <u>Section 8.13</u> and the Equity Commitment Letter, subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter) without posting a bond or other undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. The pursuit of specific performance by any party at any time will not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to which such party may be entitled. If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent to consummate the Transactions pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent, and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged breach, the Company may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach on behalf of its stockholders. The parties acknowledge that the provisions contained in this <u>Section 8.13</u> are reasonable and necessary to protect the legitimate interests of the Company and constitute a material inducement to the Company to enter into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the rights of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters under the terms thereof, and in any case subject to and not in limitation of <u>Section 8.15</u>, none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or its and their direct and indirect stockholders shall have any rights or claims (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) against any Parent Financing Source, solely in their respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Debt Financing.</p>
