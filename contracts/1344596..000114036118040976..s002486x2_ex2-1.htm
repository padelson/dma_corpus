1.1 _The Merger_.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the NDBCA, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue

property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are referred to herein as the "
_Transactions_ ". Parent and the Company agree that for U.S. federal income
tax purposes the Merger shall be treated as a stock purchase, whereby Parent
purchases all of the Company Shares.

  

  

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the filing of the Articles of Merger
and without the necessity of further action by the Company or any other
Person, the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be

_Exhibit C_ hereto, and as so amended and restated shall be the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended
as provided therein or by applicable Law. In addition, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation shall take all necessary action such that, at the
Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as
to read in its entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit D_ hereto, and as so
amended shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the necessity
of further action by the Company or any other Person, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time or such other individuals
designated by Parent as of the Effective Time shall become the directors of
the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office, from and after the Effective
Time, in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time or such other individuals designated by Parent as of the
Effective Time shall become the officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to
hold office in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors shall have been duly
elected, designated or qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation.

  

 

\- 2 -  

  

(d) If, at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation,
as applicable, as a result of, or in connection with, the Transactions or
otherwise to carry out this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, then the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either the Company or Merger
Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments and
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements.

  

  

1.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern time, at the offices of
Thompson Hine LLP, 335 Madison Avenue, 12th Floor, New York, NY 10017, on the
fifth (5th) Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted by Law) of all of the applicable conditions set forth in _Article 6_
so long as such conditions remain satisfied or waived on such fifth (5th)
Business Day (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions at the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) if the Marketing
Period has not ended as of such date, then the Closing shall not occur until
the date following such satisfaction or waiver that is the earlier of (x) any
Business Day during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no
less than five (5) Business Days' prior notice to the Company (it being agreed
that such notice may be conditioned upon the simultaneous completion of the
Debt Financing, and it being further agreed that if such Debt Financing is not
completed for any reason at any time, such notice shall automatically be
deemed withdrawn) and (y) five (5) Business Days after the final day of the
Marketing Period; and (b) notwithstanding the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in _Article 6_ , this Agreement may be terminated
pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 7.1_ such that the parties hereto
shall not be required to effect the Closing, regardless of whether the final
day of the Marketing Period shall have occurred prior to such termination. The
actual date on which the Closing is to occur pursuant to this _Section 1.2_ is
referred to as the " _Closing Date_." On the Closing Date, Merger Sub or the
Company shall cause articles of merger (including a plan of merger) (the "
_Articles of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of North Dakota in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
NDBCA and shall make all other filings required under the NDBCA in connection
with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Articles of
Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
North Dakota, or such later date and time as is agreed upon by the parties
hereto and specified in the Articles of Merger (such date and time hereinafter
referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.3 _Escrows_.

  

  

(a) Parent and the Company will use their respective best efforts to enter
into the Escrow Agreement and cause the Escrow Agent to establish the Escrow
Accounts promptly following the execution of this Agreement, including by
submitting all KYC information requested by the Escrow Agent (i) if reasonably
practicable, on the same day as it is requested, or (ii) otherwise, as
promptly as possible (which establishment, for the avoidance of doubt, is to
occur in advance of any Escrow Amounts being deposited with the Escrow Agent).

  

  

(b) _Deposit Escrow Accounts_.

  

  

(i) _Initial Deposit Escrow_. On or prior to 5:00pm on the Initial Deposit
Escrow Deadline, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, Fifty Five
Million Dollars ($55,000,000.00) (the " _Initial Deposit Escrow Amount_ ") in
immediately available funds with the Escrow Agent into an escrow account (the
" _Initial Deposit Escrow Account_ ") established pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(ii) _Subsequent Deposit Escrow_. On or prior to 5:00pm on the Subsequent
Deposit Escrow Deadline, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, an
amount equal to the excess (if any) of (A) Seventy Five Million Dollars
($75,000,000.00) over (B) the balance (if any) of the Breach Escrow Account at
the time of such deposit (such excess, the " _Subsequent Deposit Escrow
Amount_ " and, together with the Initial Deposit Escrow Amount, the " _Deposit
Escrow Amounts_ ") in immediately available funds with the Escrow Agent into
an escrow account (the " _Subsequent Deposit Escrow Account_ " and, together
with the Initial Deposit Escrow Account, the " _Deposit Escrow Accounts_ ")
established pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(c) _Breach Escrow Account_. In the event that any Breach Escrow Election
Notice is delivered to Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with _Section
7.4(a)_ , then, on or prior to the Breach Escrow Deposit Deadline with respect
to such Breach Escrow Election Notice, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited, an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) One Hundred Thirty
Million Dollars ($130,000,000.00) over (ii) the balance (if any) of the
Deposit Escrow Accounts at the time of such deposit (such excess, the "
_Breach Escrow Amount_ " and, together with the Deposit Escrow Amounts, the "
_Escrow Amounts_ ") in immediately available funds with the Escrow Agent into
an escrow account (the " _Breach Escrow Account_ " and, together with the
Deposit Escrow Accounts, the " _Escrow Accounts_ ") established pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger Sub,
collectively, shall not be required to deposit, or cause to be deposited, into
the Escrow Accounts, more than $130,000,000 in the aggregate.

  

  

(e) In the event that this Agreement is terminated, then, on the six-month
anniversary of the date of such termination (the " _Escrow Release Date_ "),
Parent and the Company shall execute a joint written instruction directing the
Escrow Agent to make a cash payment to Parent equal to the full balance of the
Escrow Accounts, less the aggregate amounts asserted in respect of any claims
that have been submitted by the Company against Parent or the Sponsor prior to
the Escrow Release Date that remain pending as of the Escrow Release Date.
Following the final non-appealable determination of such pending claims, (i)
the amount that is finally determined to be due to the Company in respect of
such claims shall be paid from the Escrow Accounts to the Company and (ii) the
remaining balance of the Escrow Accounts shall be paid to Parent, and Parent
and the Company shall execute a joint written instruction directing the Escrow
Agent to make such disbursement.

Article 2 
  CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

  

  

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

(a) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each of the foregoing, a " _Company Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Company Shares_ "), other than Company Shares to be
cancelled or converted pursuant to _Sections 2.1(b)_ or _(c)_ or Dissenting
Shares, shall be converted into and thereafter represent the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration without interest, subject to any required
withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section 2.4_ , upon surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_. As
of the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with _Section 2.2_.

  

  

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Parent and Merger Sub Owned Shares_.
Each Company Share held by the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise),
Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiaries, in each case, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect
thereof.

  

  

(c) _Merger Sub Equity Interests_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation, with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and
after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock of
Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of shares
of common stock of the Surviving Corporation into which they were converted in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

  

 

\- 5 -  

  

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

  

  

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity and
terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Company) for the purpose of delivering or causing to be delivered to
each holder of Company Shares the Per Share Merger Consideration that such
holder shall become entitled to receive with respect to each Company Share
held by such holder pursuant to the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). The
Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying
Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, (x) Parent and the Company shall
execute a joint written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to make,
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, a cash payment to the Paying
Agent equal to the full balance of the Escrow Accounts and (y) Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited (including, via clause (x) above), cash in
an amount equal to the Aggregate Merger Consideration with the Paying Agent
(such cash deposited with the Paying Agent, collectively, the " _Payment Fund_
"), which holders of Company Shares (other than Company Shares to be cancelled
or converted pursuant to _Sections 2.1(b)_ or _(c)_ or Dissenting Shares)
shall be entitled to at the Effective Time upon due surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates) or Book-Entry
Company Shares. The Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders
of the Company Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such investments
shall be in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States government or
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor's Corporation, respectively. Earnings from such investments shall be
payable to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs, and no part
of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company Shares.

  

  

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

  

  

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), the Paying
Agent shall mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, a holder of record of Company Shares represented by certificates (the "
_Certificates_ "), which Company Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to
this Agreement: (A) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall
include any certifications Parent may reasonably request relating to any
withholding obligations of Parent under the Code or other applicable Tax Law,
and shall otherwise be in such form as Parent and the Paying Agent shall
reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in
_Section 2.2(e)_ ) in exchange for payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each Company Share. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in _Section 2.2(e)_ )
to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, and such other
documents as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions, the
holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration for each Company Share formerly represented by such Certificates
(without interest and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.4_ ), and any Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration is to
be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established
to the satisfaction of Parent and the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes
either have been paid or are not required to be paid. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until
surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Agreement, except for
Certificates representing Company Shares that are Dissenting Shares, which
shall be deemed to represent the right to receive the Dissenting Stockholder
Consideration.

(ii) _Book-Entry Company Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Shares
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Company Shares_ ") shall be required
to deliver a Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Company
Shares held through The Depository Trust Company, an executed letter of
transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. In lieu
thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Company Shares held
through The Depository Trust Company whose Company Shares were converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration at the Effective Time
pursuant to this Agreement shall, upon receipt of an "agent's message" in
customary form by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence of transfer or
surrender as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be entitled to receive,
and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver to The Depository
Trust Company or its nominee as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each such Book-Entry
Company Share pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_ (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.4_ ), and
such Book-Entry Company Shares of such holder shall be cancelled. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3)
Business Days after the Effective Time), the Paying Agent shall mail to each
Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Book-Entry Company Shares not held through The Depository Trust Company:
(A) a letter of transmittal, which shall include any certifications Parent may
reasonably request relating to any withholding obligations of Parent under the
Code or other applicable Tax Law and be in such form as Parent and the Paying
Agent shall reasonably agree; and (B) instructions for returning such letter
of transmittal in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon
delivery of such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in proper
form, in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, the holder
of such Book-Entry Company Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each such Book-Entry
Company Share pursuant to the provisions of this _Article 2_ (without interest
and after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.4_ ), and such Book-Entry Company Shares shall forthwith be
cancelled. Payment and delivery of the Per Share Merger Consideration with
respect to Book-Entry Company Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose
name such Book-Entry Company Shares are registered. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Company
Shares. Until paid or surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry
Company Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Agreement, except for Book-Entry Company Shares
representing Company Shares that are Dissenting Shares, which shall be deemed
to represent the right to receive the Dissenting Stockholder Consideration.

  

 

\- 7 -  

  

(c) _Transfer Books ; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Company Shares that represented ownership of
Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Company Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

(d) _Termination of Fund ; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any portion of
the funds in the Payment Fund (including any proceeds of any investments
received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares on the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time will be returned to Parent or an
Affiliate thereof designated by Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who
has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares for the Per
Share Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_ prior to such
time shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Per Share Merger
Consideration, without interest and subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law, in respect of such holder's surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares and in compliance with the
procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_. Any portion of the Payment Fund remaining
unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Company Shares
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or
become property of, any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of Parent or an Affiliate thereof
designated by Parent, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective
Affiliates will be liable to any holder or former holder of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Company Shares for any Per Share Merger Consideration from the
Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any portion of the Payment Fund
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_ in respect of
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Parent or an Affiliate thereof
designated by Parent, upon demand.

  

 

\- 8 -  

  

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificates
to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Per Share Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_. Parent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per Share
Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in a reasonable sum as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

  

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.3_ ), Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Company
Shares cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ ) and held by a holder
who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement, and who is
entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Company Shares
in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with, Section 10-19.1-87
and Section 10-19.1-88 of the NDBCA (such Company Shares, the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and cease to exist,
and the holders of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the rights granted to them under Section 10-19.1-87 of
the NDBCA (the " _Dissenting Stockholder Consideration_ "). If any such holder
fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or loses his right to
appraisal under Section 10-19.1-87 and Section 10-19.1-88 of the NDBCA or
other applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the Dissenting
Stockholder Consideration in respect of such Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest and subject to
any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with this
_Article 2_ and shall not thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. The
Company shall give Parent prompt written notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Company Shares, any waiver or withdrawal of any such
demand, and any other demands, notices or instruments served pursuant to the
NDBCA and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the Dissenting
Stockholder Consideration for such Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have
the opportunity and right to participate in and control all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or compromise, any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing, except to the extent required by
applicable Law.

  

 

\- 9 -  

  

2.4 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, the Treasury Regulations or any other provision of
applicable Law. Any amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment shall
be timely remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority and, when so remitted,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made. If any of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company become aware that any amount
is required to be withheld from the Per Share Merger Consideration (other than
pursuant to Section 1471, 1472 or 3406 of the Code), it shall promptly notify
the other parties to this Agreement. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to
notify the Company and the Significant Stockholder of any amounts required to
be withheld or deducted from the Per Share Merger Consideration and remitted
to any Taxing Authority (other than pursuant to Section 1471, 1472 or 3406 of
the Code), including providing the applicable provision of Law pursuant to
which such withholding is required to be made at least ten (10) Business Days
before any such withholding.

  

  

2.5 _Certain Adjustments_. In the event that, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Company Shares
shall occur as a result of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of Equity Interests
convertible into or exchangeable for Company Shares), recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar event, the
Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
event and to provide to holders of Company Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that nothing in
this _Section 2.5_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize the Company to take
any such action or effect any such change that it is not otherwise authorized
or permitted to take pursuant to this Agreement (including _Section 5.1_ ).

  

  

2.6 _Treatment of Company SARs_. At the Effective Time, each stock
appreciation right granted under the Company Share Plan (each, a " _Company
SAR_ ") that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive from Parent or
its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) the following, subject
to _Section 2.4_:

  

  

(a) On the first regularly scheduled payroll date occurring more than five
Business Days after the Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment (without
interest and less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment) equal to, with respect to the portion, if any, of each Company
SAR that is vested in accordance with its terms at or prior to Closing (the "
_Vested SAR Portion_ "), the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Per
Share Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise or base price per Company
Share subject to such Vested SAR Portion and (ii) the total number of Company
Shares underlying such Vested SAR Portion.

  

  

(b) Any Company SAR which has an exercise or base price per Company Share that
is greater than or equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration and any Company
SAR (or any portion thereof) that is unvested in accordance with its terms at
Closing shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration or
payment.

  

  

(c) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company Board and the
Compensation Committee of the Company, as applicable, shall adopt any
resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to terminate the Company
Share Plan and to effectuate the treatment of the Company SARs pursuant to
this _Section 2.6_.

other Transactions.

Shares and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share (the
" _Preferred Stock_ "). As of the date hereof, (i) 19,083,878 Company Shares
were issued and outstanding, all of which were validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and were free of preemptive or similar rights, purchase options,
calls, rights of first refusal or similar rights and (ii) 2,268,419 Company
Shares were held in treasury. As of the date hereof, no shares of Preferred

outstanding Equity Interests of the Company, (B) no Equity Interests of the

Subsidiaries, there are no other options, calls, warrants or other rights,
agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the
issued or unissued Equity Interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party.

  

 

\- 13 -  

  

(b) _Section 3.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of each Subsidiary of the Company and for each such Subsidiary,
its jurisdiction of organization, entity type, and outstanding number and type
of Equity Interests. Each of the outstanding Equity Interests of each of the
Company's Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and all such Equity Interests are (i) owned by the Company or
another wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) free and clear of all
Liens and (iii) not subject to any voting or other similar Contract with
respect to the voting of such Equity Interests.

name of the holder of such Company SAR, (ii) the number of Company Shares
subject to such Company SAR, (iii) the grant date of such Company SAR, (iv)
the exercise or base price, and (v) the vesting schedule (including whether
the vesting will be accelerated by the execution of this Agreement by the
Company or the consummation by the Company of the Transactions or by
termination of employment following the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions) applicable to such Company SAR. All Company SARs have been
granted having a per-share exercise or base price at least equal to the fair
market value of the referenced equity on the date of grant, and have not
otherwise been subject to "modification" or "extension" within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code and associated U.S. Treasury Department guidance. All
grants of Company SARs were validly issued and properly approved by the
Company Board (or compensation committee or other designee thereof) in
accordance in all material respects with the applicable Company Share Plan and
applicable Laws, including the applicable requirements of the NASDAQ and the
NDPTCA. Neither the grant of nor the vesting of any SARs (whether as a
consequence of the execution of this Agreement by the Company or the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions or by termination of
employment following the consummation by the Company of the Transactions or
otherwise) shall cause such SARs to be deemed a "poison pill" with respect to
the Company or any Subsidiary for purposes of the NDPTCA. The treatment of
Company SARS under this Agreement complies (i) in all material respects with
applicable Laws and (ii) in all respects with the terms and conditions of the
Company Share Plan and the applicable Company SAR agreements.

furnished or filed since January 1, 2017 and prior to the date hereof,

prior to the date hereof, as of the date of such amendment or superseding
filing), none of the Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a

procedures (as such terms are defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) designed to ensure that material information relating to the
Company, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the chief executive
officer and the chief financial officer of the Company by others within those

Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is

in the rules and forms of the SEC.

  

  

(d) The Company has established and maintains a system of internal controls
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the

for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, including policies and
procedures that are designed to (i) require the maintenance of records that in
reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company and its Subsidiaries are being made only in
accordance with appropriate authorizations of management and the Company Board
and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

 

\- 15 -  

  

(e) Since the earlier of (i) January 1, 2018 and (ii) the date of the
Company's management's and its auditors most recently completed evaluation of
the Company's internal controls over financial reporting prior to the date
hereof, neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
Company's independent auditors has identified or been made aware of (A) any
significant deficiency or any material weakness in the system of internal
accounting controls utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries, which has
not been subsequently remediated, or (B) any fraud that involves the Company's
management or other employees who have a role in the preparation of financial
statements or the internal accounting controls utilized by the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any

are, and since January 1, 2016 have been, in compliance with all Laws

the Company's and its Subsidiaries' businesses as currently conducted or
materially impair or materially delay the Closing. All such Permits and
Approvals are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to materially affect the Company's and its Subsidiaries' businesses
as currently conducted or materially impair or materially delay the Closing.
The Company has not received any written notification of a suspension,
cancellation, non-renewal or adverse modification of any Permits or Approvals
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the Knowledge of the Company no
such suspension, cancellation, non-renewal or adverse modification is pending,

upon the giving of notice or passage of time or both, would permit,
revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or termination
of any Permits and Approvals that are currently in effect, in each case, the
loss of which would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
materially affect the Company's and its Subsidiaries' businesses as currently
conducted or materially impair or materially delay the Closing. Neither the
Company, nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice within the
past three (3) years of any investigation or review by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the Company or its or its Subsidiaries' businesses and
operations, other than investigations or reviews (x) conducted in connection

Material Adverse Effect or materially impair or materially delay the Closing.
To the Company's Knowledge, no investigation or review is threatened, nor has
any Governmental Entity indicated in writing any intention to conduct the
same, other than investigations or reviews (x) conducted in connection with
ordinary license renewal procedures and/or (y) the outcome of which would not,

Material Adverse Effect or materially impair or materially delay the Closing.

with respect to loss, damage or unauthorized access, use, modification or
breach of security of Personal Information maintained by or on behalf of any

(c) As of the date hereof, each of the Financing Commitment Letters is in full
force and effect and is a legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
Parent (to the extent party thereto) and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the
other parties thereto, in each case subject to the Enforceability Exceptions.
Assuming due and valid execution by each other party thereto (in the case of
the Debt Commitment Letters only), each of the Financing Commitment Letters is
enforceable against the parties thereto in accordance with its terms, subject
to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof, none of the Financing
Commitment Letters have been amended, supplemented or modified in any respect,
and the respective commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn,
terminated, rescinded or otherwise modified in any respect, nor, to Parent's
Knowledge, is any such amendment, supplement, modification, withdrawal,
termination or rescission currently contemplated or the subject of discussions
(other than to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
other similar entities who had not executed a Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date hereof, in each case, as contemplated by and in accordance with such Debt
Commitment Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any such added lender,
lead arranger, bookrunner, syndication agent or other similar entity is a
Qualified Bank, and (ii) in no event shall the addition of any such lender,
lead arranger, bookrunner, syndication agent or other similar entity reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on the Closing Date
(including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) from that contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters (unless, in
each case, the amount of the Equity Financing has been increased by a
corresponding amount, or the Company has given its prior written consent
thereto)). As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or material breach
on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of the Parent, any other party
thereto under any Financing Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, Parent
is not aware of any fact, event or other occurrence that makes any of the
representations and warranties of Parent in any Financing Commitment Letter
inaccurate in any material respect. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies directly or indirectly related to the funding of the full amount
of the Financing (including any flex provisions) other than the conditions
precedent set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters and, as of the date
hereof, Parent has no reason to believe that it will not be able to satisfy
any term or condition of closing of the Financing that is required to be
satisfied as a condition of the Financing, or that the full amount of the
Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. Other than
the Financing Commitment Letters, there are no side letters or other
Contracts, arrangements or understandings (written or oral) directly or
indirectly related to the Financing (except for customary fee letters,
engagement letters relating to the Debt Financing and non-disclosure
agreements, none of which impact the conditionality, timing or amount of the
Financing) which could adversely impact the timing or availability of the
Financing, including without limitation, by providing for additional or
different conditions to the timing or availability of the Financing not
otherwise contained in the Financing Commitment Letters. There is no condition
to the Financing the satisfaction of which would prevent the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 hereof, and there is no
condition set forth in Sections 6.1, 6.2, or 6.3 hereof the satisfaction of
which would prevent the satisfaction of a condition to the Financing. Upon the
funding of the Financing in accordance with and subject to its terms and
conditions (including after giving effect to any pricing flex that results in
OID, if exercised), the aggregate proceeds of the Financing, together with
other unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand of Parent on the Closing
Date, are, and will be, in an amount sufficient to (i) consummate the Closing
upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) pay all other amounts
payable by Parent or its Affiliates pursuant to the other Ancillary Agreements
to which any such Person is a party, (iii) pay all related fees and expenses
of Parent and its Affiliates and Representatives, and (iv) to the extent any
other amounts are required to be paid by the Parent on the Closing Date to
consummate the Transactions, pay all such other amounts (including refinancing
or repayment of any debt contemplated by this Agreement). As of the date
hereof, Parent or its Affiliates have fully paid, or caused to be paid, any
and all commitment fees and any and all other fees and expenses, in each case
as are required to be paid on or before the date hereof pursuant to the terms
of the Financing Commitment Letters.

  

  

4.8 _Ownership of Merger Sub_. When Merger Sub is formed and at the Effective
Time, all of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of Merger Sub will be
owned directly or indirectly by Parent. Merger Sub is being formed solely for
purposes of the Merger.

  

 

\- 39 -  

  

4.9 _Brokers_. Neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent nor any of their
respective officers or directors on behalf of Parent or such Subsidiary of
Parent has employed any financial advisor, broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any financial advisory, broker's fees, commissions or finder's
fees in connection with any of the Transactions.

Lease Agreements in the ordinary course of business that are not, individually
or in the aggregate, in excess of $100,000, and that do not modify the term or
rates payable under any Lease Agreement; or

  

  

(xxiii) authorize or enter into any Contract, or otherwise make any
commitment, to do any of the foregoing.

5.2 _Access to Information ; Confidentiality; Title and Survey_.

  

  

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_ , the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to: (i) provide to Parent and
its Representatives reasonable access during normal business hours in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business conducted by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, upon prior notice to the Company, to the
Company Real Property and to the officers, employees, properties, offices and
other facilities of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and to the books
and records thereof (including for purposes of conducting non-invasive
environmental assessments) and (ii) promptly furnish such information
concerning the business, properties (including the Company Real Property),
Contracts, assets and liabilities of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required to (or to cause any of its
Subsidiaries to) afford such access or furnish such information to the extent
that the Company reasonably believes that doing so would: (A) result in the
loss of attorney-client privilege (but the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a manner that does not
result in a loss of attorney-client privilege), or (B) breach, contravene or
violate any applicable Law.

  

  

(b) Parent agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
Representatives not to, prior to the Effective Time, use any information
obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ for any competitive or other purpose
unrelated to the consummation of the Transactions. The confidentiality
agreement, dated as of November 2, 2017, by and between the Company and ITE
Management L.P. (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), shall apply with respect to information
furnished under this _Section 5.2_ by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives, and Parent agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions
thereof as if it was an original signatory thereto.

  

  

(c) Parent may order (i) title reports and/or owner's and/or lender's title
insurance policies from a nationally recognized title company (the " _Title
Company_ ") with respect to any of the Company Owned Real Property, (ii)
surveys of the Company Owned Real Property from one or more licensed
surveyors, and (iii) other reports or documents in respect of the Company Real
Property customarily obtained by purchasers of real property, including,
without limitation, environmental reports, property condition reports, and/or
zoning reports (collectively, the " _Title Documents_ "). The Company and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts in cooperating with
Parent, the Title Company, the surveyors, and any other service providers in
connection with Parent's efforts to obtain the Title Documents, including by
providing access to such Company Owned Real Property (subject to this _Section
5.2_ ), and providing documentation in the possession or control of the
Company and its Subsidiaries related to the Company Owned Real Property to the
extent same is reasonably requested by Parent and/or the Title Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , Company's prior written consent shall be required for
any environmental investigations which involve invasive or destructive testing
of the Company Owned Real Property or any portion thereof.

  

 

\- 45 -  

  

5.3 _No Solicitation_.

  

  

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_ , from and after the
date hereof until the Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_ , the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives not to, on
behalf of the Company, directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit,
facilitate or knowingly encourage any Acquisition Proposal or the making or
submission thereof or the making of any proposal that could reasonably be
expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) participate in any
negotiations regarding, or furnish any Third Party any non-public information
relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to cease immediately and cause to be terminated, and shall not
authorize or knowingly permit any of its or their Representatives to continue,
any and all existing activities, discussion or negotiations, if any, with any
Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third
Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of non-public information in
respect of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on
behalf of the Company and its Affiliates to return or destroy (and confirm
destruction of) all such information. Except as expressly permitted by this
_Section 5.3_ , from and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, or,
if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_ ,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) adopt, approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, withhold or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation, (iii) if an
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed, fail, within three (3) days
of the request of Parent, to publicly recommend against such Acquisition
Proposal in accordance with _Section 5.3(e)_ , (iv) approve, authorize, cause
or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or other similar agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal
(a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (v) resolve or agree to do any of
the foregoing (any action set forth in the foregoing _clauses (i)_ through
_(v)_ of this sentence, a " _Change of Board Recommendation_ ").

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_ ,
if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Written Consent
Effective Time (i) the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal from a Third Party that did not result from a violation of _Section
5.3(a)_ and the Company, its Affiliates and its and their Representatives are
not in willful and material breach of this _Section 5.3_ and (ii) the Company
Board (or a duly authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith, based
on information then available and after consultation with outside counsel and
based on financial analyses believed to be reasonable by the Company Board,
that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would be reasonably expected to
result in, a Superior Proposal and the failure to take such action would be
reasonably expected to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties to
the Company's stockholders under applicable Law or the Agreed Upon Standard,
then the Company may (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal, its
Representatives and potential sources of financing pursuant to (but only
pursuant to) one or more Acceptable Confidentiality Agreements; _provided_
that the Company shall promptly (within 24 hours) provide Parent any non-
public information concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is
provided to such person or its Representatives unless such information has
been previously provided or made available to Parent and (y) participate in
discussions or negotiations with the Third Party making such Acquisition
Proposal regarding such Acquisition Proposal.

  

 

\- 46 -  

  

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for
non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries made
in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or request for access to the
business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries made in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, which notice
shall identify the Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and include a
copy of such Acquisition Proposal (or, where such Acquisition Proposal was not
submitted in writing, a reasonably detailed written description of such
Acquisition Proposal including its material terms and conditions), and whether
the Company has furnished non-public information to, or entered into
negotiations or discussions with, such Third Party. Without limiting the
foregoing, the Company shall keep Parent promptly informed (and in any event
within 24 hours) in all material respects of the status of, and any material
communications relating to, such Acquisition Proposal (including any change in
the price or other material terms thereof) and shall provide to Parent within
24 hours after receipt thereof all copies of any material correspondence and
written materials received by the Company from the Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not
take any action that would prohibit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
from complying with their respective obligations under this _Section 5.3_.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_ ,
if (i) the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from
a Third Party that does not result from a violation of _Section 5.3(a)_ and
such Acquisition Proposal has not been withdrawn, (ii) the Company, its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives are not in willful and material
breach of this _Section 5.3_ , and (iii) the Company Board (or any duly
authorized committee thereof) determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel and based on financial analyses believed to be
reasonable by the Company Board, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal and failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable
Law or the Agreed Upon Standard, the Company Board may at any time prior to
the Written Consent Effective Time, effect a Change of Board Recommendation
with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, subject to the requirements of this
_Section 5.3(d)_. For the avoidance of doubt, except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Written Consent, a Change of Board Recommendation shall have
no effect on the effectiveness of the Written Consent. The Company shall not
be entitled to effect a Change of Board Recommendation pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(d)_ unless:

  

  

(i) the Company shall have provided to Parent at least five (5) Business Days'
prior written notice (such period and any period commenced by a new written
notice delivered pursuant to the last sentence of _Section 5.3(d)(iii)_ , the
" _Notice Period_ ") of the Company's intention to take such actions, which
notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, the basis for such Change of Board
Recommendation, the identity of the Third Party making such Superior Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal, and shall include
a copy of the applicable Company Acquisition Agreement and any other material
documents with respect thereto;

  

  

(ii) during the Notice Period, if requested by Parent, the Company shall have,
and shall have caused its Representatives to have, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent and its Representatives regarding any amendments or
modifications to this Agreement proposed by Parent and intended to cause the
relevant Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

  

  

 

\- 47 -  

  

  

(iii) at the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee thereof) shall have considered in good faith any proposed
amendments or modifications to this Agreement, including a change to the price
terms hereof and thereof and the other agreements contemplated hereby that may
be offered by Parent (the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 6:00
p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the Notice Period and shall have
determined in good faith after a consultation with outside legal counsel that
the Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal if such
Proposed Changed Terms were to be given effect (except that the Company Board
(or a duly authorized committee thereof) may have regard to whether the terms
of the Financing are sufficient to fund the Proposed Changed Terms). In the
event of any change to the price terms or any other material revision or
amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal, then the Company shall be
required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to again comply with
the requirements of this _Section 5.3(d)_ (which shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_ ) with respect to such new written notice.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board
from (i) disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act; (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company if the Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof)
determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal counsel that
the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to breach its
fiduciary duties or violate applicable Law; or (iii) issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that in each
case of _clause (i)_ , _clause (ii)_ and _clause (iii)_ , the Company Board
does not include any statement that itself would be a Change of Board
Recommendation; _provided_ further that Parent may request for the Company to
publicly recommend against an Acquisition Proposal.

  

  

(f) The Company acknowledges and agrees that any violation of the restrictions
set forth in this _Section 5.3_ by any of its Affiliates or their
Representatives acting on behalf of the Company or its Affiliates shall be
deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by the Company.

  

  

5.4 _Written Consent; Preparation of Information Statement_.

  

  

(a) In connection with the Written Consent, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to comply, and shall comply in all material respects, with the NDBCA
and the NDPTCA, including Section 10-35-20 thereof, the Company Charter and
the Company Bylaws.

  

  

(b) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days of the date hereof), the Company shall prepare
and file with the SEC a written information statement of the type contemplated
by Rule 14c-2 of the Exchange Act containing the information specified in
Schedule 14C under the Exchange Act concerning the Written Consent, the Merger
and the Transactions (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the "
_Information Statement_ ") and shall use reasonable best efforts to have the
Information Statement cleared by the SEC promptly. Each of the Company and
Parent shall furnish all information concerning such Person to the other as
may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Information Statement. The Company shall promptly notify
Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Information Statement and shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Information Statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing or mailing the Information Statement (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and (ii) shall
consider for inclusion in such document or response all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent and its counsel.

  

 

\- 48 -  

  

(c) The Company agrees that the Information Statement will comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and shall
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that none of the information included or
incorporated by reference in the Information Statement will, at the date the
Information Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of
the Company, or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, except that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to
statements made in the Information Statement based on information supplied in
writing by or on behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation
by reference therein. Parent agrees to use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that none of such information will, at the date the Information Statement is
filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company, or at the
time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. If, at any time prior
to the date that is twenty (20) days after the Information Statement is first
mailed to the Company's stockholders, any information relating to the Company,
Parent or any of its Affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
the Company or Parent which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Information Statement, so that the Information Statement
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

  

  

(d) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Information
Statement to be (i) filed with the SEC in definitive form as contemplated by
Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act and (ii) mailed to the stockholders of the
Company, in each case as promptly as practicable after, and in any event
within two (2) days after, the latest of (A) confirmation from the SEC that it
has no further comments on the Information Statement, (B) confirmation from
the SEC that the Information Statement is otherwise not to be reviewed or (C)
expiration of the ten (10) day period after filing in the event the SEC does
not review the Information Statement.

5.5 _Appropriate Action ; Consents; Filings_.

  

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary, proper or advisable under
this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
Transactions as promptly as practicable, including all necessary actions or
non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals, Orders and authorizations from
Governmental Entities (including, without limitation, those in connection with
the HSR Act). The parties agree that the use of "reasonable best efforts" in
this _Section 5.5_ shall include taking any and all steps necessary to obtain
approval of the consummation of the Transactions by any Governmental Entity
responsible for antitrust matters, including taking all steps necessary to
avoid or eliminate each and every legal impediment under any applicable
antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other
Person so as to enable the parties hereto to close the Transactions as
promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event prior to the Outside
Date, including (1) proposing, negotiating, accepting, committing to and
effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of either party or its Subsidiaries' assets,
properties or businesses; (2) the entrance into, or the amendment,
modification or termination of, any Contracts or other arrangements; and (3)
other remedies in order to obtain such approvals and to avoid the entry of,
and to avoid the commencement of litigation or other Proceedings seeking the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other applicable Law in any suit or other Proceeding,
which would otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the Transaction. In addition, Parent and the Company will, and
will cause each of their Subsidiaries to, defend through litigation on the
merits so as to enable the parties hereto to close the Transaction as promptly
as reasonably practicable (and in any event prior to the Outside Date) any
claim asserted in court or an administrative or other tribunal by any
Governmental Entity or other Person under applicable Laws to avoid entry of,
or to have vacated or terminated, any Order (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) or other applicable Law that would prevent or materially delay the
Closing from occurring as promptly as reasonably practicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, such litigation shall in no way
limit the obligations of the parties to comply with their obligations under
the terms of this _Section 5.5_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, no party will be required to agree to any sale,
transfer, license, separate holding, divestiture or other disposition of, or
to any prohibition of or any limitation on the acquisition, ownership,
operation, effective control or exercise of full rights of ownership, or other
modification of rights in respect of, any assets or businesses or other remedy
that is not conditioned on the consummation of the Transaction.

  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall furnish to each other party such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing. Subject to applicable Law
relating to the exchange of information, outside counsel for the Company and
Parent shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each shall consult with the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Subsidiaries, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Transactions. In exercising the foregoing rights, each
of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.
Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the
Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Transactions, including promptly
furnishing each such other party with copies of notices or other written
substantive communications received by such party or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity and/or Third Party with respect to
such Transactions, and, to the extent practicable under the circumstances,
shall provide the other party and its counsel with the opportunity to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
substantive filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the
Transactions. With respect to the matters in this _Section 5.5_ , Parent shall
in any event control the strategy and process relating to all approvals under
any antitrust or competition Law so long as Parent reasonably consults in
advance with the Company and considers in good faith the views of the Company
with respect thereto.

  

 

\- 50 -  

  

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company
and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, make or
cause to be made all required HSR Act notifications within five (5) Business
Days after the date of this Agreement, to the extent required. If the Company
or Parent receives a request for information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions (including, but not
limited to, such requests with respect to the HSR Act), then such party shall
in good faith make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other parties, a response which is, at a minimum,
in substantial compliance with such request.

  

  

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article 7_ , unless prohibited by applicable Law, each party
shall give prompt notice to the other parties if any of the following occur:
(a) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any Person
alleging that the consent or approval of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Transactions; (b) receipt of any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Entity or the NASDAQ (or any other
securities market) in connection with the Transactions; or (c) such party
becoming aware of the occurrence of an event that could prevent or delay
beyond the Outside Date the consummation of the Transactions or that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions to the Merger set
forth in _Article 6_ being incapable of satisfaction. The making of such a
notice (in and of itself) pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not affect any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement and any failure to give such notice (in and of itself)
shall not be taken into account in determining whether the conditions set
forth in _Article 6_ have been satisfied or give rise to any right of
termination set forth in _Article 7_.

  

  

5.7 _Public Announcements_. So long as this Agreement is in effect, none of
the Company or Parent and Merger Sub (or any of their respective Affiliates)
shall issue any press release or make any public statement with respect to the
Transactions or this Agreement without the prior written consent of each other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), except (a) as may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable U.S. securities exchange, NASDAQ or Governmental
Entity to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best
efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release
or announcement in advance of such issuance, or (b) with respect to any press
release or other public statement by the Company permitted by _Section 5.3_.
Each of the parties may issue a press release announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transaction; _provided_
that each such press release shall not be issued prior to the approval of each
other party hereto. The Company shall file a Current Report on Form 8-K with
the SEC attaching its press release and a copy of this Agreement as an
exhibit.

  

 

\- 51 -  

  

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time and for the period ending on the date
that is six (6) months from the Effective Time (or, if earlier, until the
termination of such Continuing Employee's employment), Parent shall (i)
provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to
provide to each employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Effective Time who remains employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporation) following the Effective Time (each a "
_Continuing Employee_ ") base compensation that is not less favorable than the
base compensation provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) provide or cause its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Corporation, to provide benefits (including target annual cash bonus
opportunity but excluding equity-based or equity-linked compensation or
benefits, and excluding any pension or other retiree benefits) to each
Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, have a value that is substantially
comparable in the aggregate as such benefits provided to similarly-situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries, or provided to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, as determined by Parent in
its discretion; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to Continuing
Employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements, compensation
and benefits shall be provided in accordance with the applicable collective
bargaining agreements.

  

  

(b) With respect to benefit plans maintained by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, for all purposes, including
determining eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accruals
(including any vacation and paid time off accruals), each Continuing
Employee's service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as reflected
in the Company's records, shall be treated as service with Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation where length of service
is relevant; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized
or credited (i) to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of coverage or benefits, (ii) with respect to a newly established
plan for which prior service is not taken into account or with respect to any
equity-based compensation, or (iii) to the extent that such recognition would
result in benefit accruals with respect to any defined benefit plan.

  

  

(c) Parent shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) to take reasonable best efforts to, waive, or cause to be waived,
any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, evidence of insurability,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in which Continuing
Employees (and their covered family members) will be eligible to participate
from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting
periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company
Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, to take reasonable best
efforts to recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all co-
payments / co-insurance, deductibles, out-of-pocket maximums and similar
expenses incurred by each Continuing Employee (and his or her covered family
members) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for
purposes of satisfying such year's deductible and out-of-pocket maximum under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which such Continuing Employee (and
family members) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

  

 

\- 52 -  

  

(d) From and after the Effective Time through the end of the calendar year
2018, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and
continue the Company's Management Incentive Plan for Fiscal Year 2018 (the "
_2018 MIP_ ") as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with its terms. Parent shall pay, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to pay, to eligible Company Employees cash bonuses under the 2018
MIP for calendar year 2018 in the ordinary course (and at the time ordinarily
paid) based on actual results for such year.

  

  

(e) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.9_ , the provisions of this
_Section 5.8_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee (including any Continuing Employee), director or
consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or
dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 5.8_ shall
create such rights in any such individuals. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall: (i) guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude
the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their respective
Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Continuing Employee at any time
and for any reason; (ii) the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to continue any Company Plan or other employee benefit plans,
programs or Contracts or prevent the amendment, modification or termination
thereof following the Closing; or (iii) amend any Company Plans or other
employee benefit plans, programs or Contracts.

  

  

(f) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall timely satisfy any required
notifications and/or consent requirements of any works councils or other labor
or employee organizations, as may be required under applicable Law or any
collective bargaining or similar labor agreement, in each case in connection

5.9 _Indemnification_.

  

  

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall
advance expenses as incurred ( _provided_ that the Indemnitee to whom expenses
are advanced provides an undertaking, in customary form, to repay such amounts
if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification for such matter), to the extent
provided in (i) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar
Organizational Documents of any Subsidiary of the Company in effect as of the
date of this Agreement or (ii) any indemnification Contract of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement that is
listed on _Section 5.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, to each present and
former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries and each of
their respective employees who serves as a fiduciary of a Company Plan (in
each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, an " _Indemnitee_ " and,
collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, settlements, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to any act or omission by such Indemnitee
relating to his or her position with the Company or its Subsidiaries,
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including in connection with this
Agreement or the Transactions. In the event of any such Proceeding, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof,
and each Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the Surviving Corporation
in the defense of any such Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that it is
understood and agreed that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be
able to control the defense of any such Proceeding as it relates to any member
of the Company Board.

  

 

\- 53 -  

  

(b) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect of,
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions) existing as of the
Effective Time in favor of an Indemnitee as provided in (i) the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar Organizational Documents of any
Subsidiary of the Company in effect as of the date of this Agreement and (ii)
any indemnification Contract of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
effect as of the date of this Agreement listed on _Section 5.9_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms. For a period of no less than six
(6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect the
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions in favor
of an Indemnitee as provided in (i) the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or
similar Organizational Documents of any Subsidiary of the Company in effect as
of the date of this Agreement and (ii) any indemnification Contract of the
Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of this Agreement listed
on _Section 5.9_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, and shall not amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately before the
Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to
exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any
Proceeding pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

  

  

(c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained for the benefit of those persons that are directors and officers
of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date,
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Closing Date (the "
_D andO Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not
less favorable in the aggregate than the existing directors' and officers'
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy of the Company,
or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
coverage that is then available; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of
300% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentence shall be
deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and
officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions.
Nothing in this _Section 5.9(c)_ will require Parent to duplicate coverages
that have been procured by the Company prior to the Closing Date.

  

 

\- 54 -  

  

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause proper provision to
be made so that such successor or assignee shall expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.

  

  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such
individual may have under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or similar
Organizational Documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement or in any
indemnification Contract of the Company or its Subsidiaries in effect as of
the date of this Agreement listed on _Section 5.9_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter. From and after the Effective Time, the obligations of Parent under
this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 5.9_
applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable
Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such
termination or modification (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 5.9_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 5.9_ ).

  

  

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers' insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification
provided for in this _Section 5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims under such policies.

  

  

5.10 _Parent Agreements Concerning Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all actions
necessary or advisable to cause Merger Sub to perform its covenants,
agreements and obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the terms
hereof. Parent shall, promptly following execution of this Agreement, approve
and adopt this Agreement in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub and
deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent
approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub.

  

  

5.11 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Law becomes applicable to the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, or if the Company has or is deemed to have
adopted or otherwise become subject to any "anti-takeover provision" as such
term is defined in North Dakota Century Code Section 10-35-26 sub. 2., then
the Company and the Company Board shall grant such approvals and take all
commercially reasonable actions as may be necessary so the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to render such Takeover Law or "anti-takeover
provision" inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
Transactions.

  

 

\- 55 -  

  

5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause the Transactions and any other
dispositions of Company Shares (including derivative securities with respect
to Company Shares) resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act
with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-5 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

  

  

5.13 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall notify Parent and keep Parent
informed of, and cooperate with Parent in connection with, and give Parent
reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of, any
stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors and officers
relating to the Transactions, including the Merger and the Transactions ("
_Transaction Litigation_ "), and no such settlement of any Transaction
Litigation shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Parent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Company shall promptly notify Parent of any Transaction Litigation and shall
keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed with respect to the status
thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.13_, any
Proceeding relating to Dissenting Shares shall be governed by _Section 2.3_.

  

  

5.14 _NASDAQ Listing and SEC Registration_. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent to cause the Company Shares
to cease to be listed on the NASDAQ and to be deregistered under the Exchange
Act as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time.

  

  

5.15 _Company Indebtedness_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, timely deliver all notices and take all other administrative
actions required to facilitate (i) the termination of commitments, repayment
in full of all outstanding loans or other obligations, after the repayment in
full and the required filing of such documentation as may be required with
Surface Transportation Board of the United States and the Registrar General
Canada, release of any Liens securing such loans or obligations and guarantees
in connection therewith, and replacement of or cash collateralization of any
issued letters of credit in respect of, the Credit Facilities on or before the
Closing Date and (ii) to the extent reasonably requested in writing by Parent

compliance with _Section 5.1(b)(ix)_ (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ") in form and
substance customary for transactions of this type, from the Persons, or the
applicable agent on behalf of the Persons, to which such Indebtedness is owed,

costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys' fees)
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates or Representatives in connection with the cooperation of the
Company and the Subsidiaries contemplated by this _Section 5.16_ , in each
case, except, but only to the extent that, any such costs or expenses result
from the bad faith or willful misconduct of the Company, its Subsidiaries or
their respective Affiliates and Representatives, as applicable. Nothing
contained in this _Section 5.16_ or otherwise shall require the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to be an issuer or guarantor with respect to the Debt
Financing prior to the Closing. All non-public or other confidential
information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries provided to Parent or
its Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.16_ shall be kept confidential
by them in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except for
disclosure to potential lenders and investors and their respective

\- 61 -  

  

(d) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to,
obtain and consummate the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described
in or contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters (including any flex
provisions applicable to any Debt Commitment Letter) on or before the Closing
Date, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) negotiate
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters, or on other terms
reasonably acceptable to Parent and not in violation of this _Section 5.16_ ,
so that such agreements are in effect no later than the Closing Date (which
definitive financing agreements shall not (1) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Debt Financing to be funded on the Closing Date (including by increasing
the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount (except OID resulting
from the exercise of any pricing flex)) from that contemplated in the Debt
Commitment Letters (unless, in each case, the amount of the Equity Financing
has been increased by a corresponding amount), (2) amend, modify or supplement
the conditions or contingencies to, or impose new or additional conditions to,
or expand any existing condition to, the Debt Financing from that contemplated
in the Debt Commitment Letters, in each case in a manner that would reasonably
be expected to make it less likely that the Debt Financing will be funded on
the Closing Date, (3) materially delay funding of the Debt Financing or make
funding of the Debt Financing less likely to occur at the Closing, or (4)
impose additional material obligations on the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or their respective Affiliates prior to Closing); (ii) satisfy on a timely
basis all conditions applicable to such Debt Financing in such definitive
agreements (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any such conditions that
cannot be satisfied as a direct result of any failure of the Company to
materially comply with its obligations under this _Section 5.16_ or the
failure of the conditions set forth in _Section 6.3_ to be satisfied); (iii)
maintain in full force and effect the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance
with the terms and subject to the conditions thereof until the Debt Financing
is consummated; and (iv) comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment
Letters and any definitive agreements related to the Debt Financing to the
extent the failure to comply with such obligations would adversely impact the
amount or timing of the Debt Financing or the availability of the Debt
Financing at the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , if Parent has raised
through alternative sources (an " _Alternative Financing_ ") funds sufficient
to consummate the Transactions, Parent shall have no obligation to arrange any
such Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in such Debt
Commitment Letters or otherwise so long as (A) Parent shall promptly notify
the Company of any such Alternative Financing together with a written
certificate to the Company that the terms of _Section 4.7_ shall apply
_mutatis mutandis_ to such Alternative Financing as if it were the Debt
Financing and (B) the terms and conditions of such Alternative Financing (x)
that are applicable prior to or relate to the conditions to the Closing are
not materially less favorable to the Company than the original Debt Financing
and (y) would not reasonably be expected to prevent, impede, or cause any
material delay in the consummation of the Merger as compared to the Debt
Financing. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing, or if applicable
any Alternative Financing, becomes unavailable, Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
arrange to obtain promptly bridge financing, alternative debt financing or
equity financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient, together
with other financial resources of Parent including unrestricted cash and cash
equivalents on hand of Parent on the Closing Date (if any), to meet Parent's
obligations to pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration, refinance certain
outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance
with _Section 5.15_ and pay all fees and expenses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, it is understood and agreed that commercially
reasonable efforts of Parent contemplated by this _Section 5.16(d)_ shall be
deemed to require Parent to bring Proceedings involving litigation against any
source of any Debt Financing, or if applicable any Alternative Financing, and
otherwise to fully enforce its rights and the counterparties' obligations
under the Debt Commitment Letters and definitive agreements related to the
Debt Financing, or if applicable any Alternative Financing, in a timely and
diligent manner by all available means to cause the lenders under the Debt
Financing, or if applicable any Alternative Financing, to fund in accordance
with their respective commitments. Parent shall provide to the Company copies
of the Debt Commitment Letters, any amendments thereto, and the definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing, or if applicable any
Alternative Financing, within a reasonable time prior to the execution thereof
and shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of material developments in respect of the financing process
relating thereto. In the event that Parent seeks to enforce its rights under
the Debt Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements entered into in
connection therewith and/or cause the financing sources to fund the Debt
Financing, or if applicable any Alternative Financing (any such action, a "
_Financing Action_ "), then Parent shall (x) keep the Company reasonably
informed of the status of the Financing Action and (y) at the reasonable
request of the Company, shall make Parent's employees and Representatives
available to discuss the status of, and developments with respect to, the
Financing Action; provided that nothing herein shall require Parent to provide
any information with respect to any Financing Action that would reasonably be
expected to result in the loss of any attorney-client privilege (but only if
such privilege is asserted in good faith). Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable, provide to the Company copies of all executed documents
(including all fee letters and engagement letters ( _provided_ that the fee
amounts, flex provisions and other economic terms (other than any such term
that would (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or (y) impose
any additional conditions or other contingencies (or otherwise amend, modify
or expand any conditions or other contingencies in a manner adverse to Parent)
or adversely affect the timing or availability of the funding of the Debt
Financing) may be redacted in a customary manner) relating to the Debt
Financing.

  

 

\- 62 -  

  

(e) Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Equity
Financing at or prior to the Closing in accordance with its terms. Parent
shall not permit, without the prior written consent of the Company, any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any termination, rescission or
withdrawal of, or any waiver of any provision or remedy under, the Equity
Commitment Letter in a manner that would reasonably be expected to: (i) delay
or prevent the Closing, (ii) modify the conditions contained in the Equity

would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially impair or delay the
Closing).

  

  

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent shall
have the right from time to time to amend, modify, waive or replace all or any
portion of the Debt Financing; _provided_ that no such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement, as applicable, shall, without the prior
written consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld) be permitted to the extent it would
reasonably be expected to (i) delay, materially impair or prevent the Closing,
(ii) modify the conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (the "
_Financing Conditions_ ") or create any new condition to the Financing or the
Alternative Financing, as applicable (other than the Financing Conditions as
in effect on the date hereof) in a manner that is adverse to Parent, (iii)
reduce the aggregate net cash proceeds of the Debt Financing, (iv) change the
date for termination and/or expiration of any Debt Commitment Letter to an
earlier date or (v) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Debt Commitment Letters or other
documentation relating to the Debt Financing prior to the Closing. Without the
prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not permit any assignment
of rights or obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters or other
documentation relating to the Debt Financing or, with respect to the Debt
Financing, consent to the addition of additional lenders or agents if such
addition would permit a reduction in the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing (it being agreed that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent
Financing Sources may syndicate the Debt Financing as contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters and Parent may amend the Debt Commitment Letters to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other similar
entities who had not executed such Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of
this Agreement, in each case, as contemplated by and in accordance with such
Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any such added
lender, lead arranger, bookrunner, syndication agent or other similar entity
is a Qualified Bank, and (ii) in no event shall the addition of any such
lender, lead arranger, bookrunner, syndication agent or other similar entity
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing to be funded on the Closing
Date (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) from that contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters (unless, in
each case, the amount of the Equity Financing has been increased by a
corresponding amount, or the Company has given its prior written consent
thereto).

(h) Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice: (i) of any material
breach or default (or any event that, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or
default) by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter (or any related fee letter
or engagement letter), or other documentation relating to the Debt Financing,
of which Parent becomes aware; (ii) of the receipt of any written notice from
any party (including future parties) to the Debt Commitment Letters (or any
related fee letter or engagement letter), or other documentation relating to
the Debt Financing, with respect to any actual or potential material breach,
default, withdrawal, termination or repudiation of any provisions of any Debt
Commitment Letter (or any related fee letter or engagement letter), or other
documentation relating to the Debt Financing, or any material dispute or
disagreement between parties to any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing (including any Financing Commitment Letter or any related fee letter
or engagement letter) with respect to the obligation to fund the Debt
Financing or the amount of the Debt Financing to be funded at the Closing or
any other event or condition that would reasonably be expected to cause a
condition to the Debt Commitment Letters (or any related fee letter or
engagement letter), or other documentation relating to the Debt Financing, not
to be satisfied; (iii) if at any time for any reason Parent believes in good
faith that all or any portion of the Debt Financing will not be able to be
obtained on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by any of the Debt Commitment Letters; (iv) if for any reason any
portion of the Debt Financing actually becomes unavailable on the terms, in
the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters
(including future parties); and (v) of any amendment or modification relating
to (A) the Equity Financing or the Equity Commitment Letter that does not
require consent pursuant to _Section 5.16(e)_ and (B) the Debt Commitment
Letters that does not require consent under this Agreement; _provided_ that
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to
disclose any information pursuant to this sentence only to the extent that (x)
such information is subject to attorney-client or similar privilege (but only
if such privilege is asserted in good faith) or (y) the disclosure of which
would be prohibited or restricted by applicable Law. Parent shall promptly
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in _clauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ or _(v)_

replacement does not require a consent solicitation of the noteholders under
the Longtrain III Facility.

warranties of Merger Sub in the Joinder shall be incorporated in full into
this Agreement by reference (and shall be deemed to be made as if Merger Sub
was an original party to this Agreement) and (z) the Joinder shall be governed

force and effect as modified by the Joinder as a valid and binding agreement

(A) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ or (B) by either the Company or

transfer of immediately available funds, the Company Termination Fee.

restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or Law preventing or making
illegal the consummation of the Merger relates to a failure to obtain the
necessary clearances, approvals or authorizations under the HSR Act or (B)
pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ as a result of the failure to satisfy the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_ , or (ii) by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_ , then Parent shall pay to the Company,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

(c) In the event that (i) the Company delivers a Breach Escrow Election Notice
to Parent in accordance with _Section 7.4(a)_ and (ii) (A) the Company
terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(j)_ or (B) (1) this
Agreement is terminated thereafter for any other reason and (2) there has not

Company, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, or cause to be paid
to the Company (including via _Section 7.4(c)_ ), the Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parent Termination Fee may not be paid
more than once.

  

  

(e) Each of the parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) each of the
Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a penalty, but
is liquidated damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent or
the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which the Company
Termination Fee or the Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable for
the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without these
agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. In the
event that the Company shall fail to pay the Company Termination Fee when due,
or Parent shall fail to pay the Parent Termination Fee when due, such party
shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable costs and expenses actually
incurred or accrued by such party (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel) in connection with any action taken to collect payment of such
amounts, together with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in the Wall Street Journal,

paid to the date of actual payment.

expressly permitted by _Section 8.13_ , and (ii) the Company's rights as a
third party beneficiary under the Equity Commitment Letter, the Company's

pursuant to _Section 7.2_ (solely against Parent and each of Merger Sub and
the Sponsor to the extent provided in the Guarantee and, to the extent
permitted by the proviso set forth in _Section 7.2_ ), shall constitute the
exclusive remedies of the Company against Parent, Merger Sub, the Sponsor, the
Parent Financing Sources or any of their respective former, current or future
general or limited partners, stockholders, equity holders, controlling Person,
members, managers, agents, Representatives, Affiliates or assignees
(collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") for all losses or damages
suffered as a result of the failure of the Transactions to be consummated (for
any reason or for no reason or otherwise) or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder or under the Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter, any
certificate or other document delivered in connection herewith or therewith or
otherwise or in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to have
been made in connection herewith or therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) under no circumstances will the
Company be entitled to, and in no event shall the Company seek to recover,
monetary damages from any Parent Related Party (other than Parent, Merger Sub
or the Sponsor pursuant to the Guarantee), (ii) in no event shall the Company
be entitled to seek or obtain any consequential damages that were not
reasonably foreseeable or special or punitive damages from any Parent Related
Party and (iii) in no event shall any amounts recovered from Parent or Merger

Guarantee). For the avoidance of doubt, in no case shall the Company be
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance pursuant to _Section

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement (or the Joinder, as applicable), (ii) such breach would reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially impair the Closing and (iii) the Company
does not terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(g), then the Company shall
be entitled to deliver a written notice to Parent and Merger Sub triggering
the Breach Escrow Account (the " _Breach Escrow Election Notice_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not be permitted to deliver more than
one Breach Escrow Election Notice.

  

 

\- 71 -  

  

  

(b) In the event that (i) Parent has deposited the Breach Escrow Amount into
the Breach Escrow Account in accordance with _Section 1.3(b)_ and (ii) Parent
confirms in writing that it is willing to attempt in good faith to consummate
the Transactions, then the Company shall support and cooperate with Parent in
connection therewith in a manner that is consistent with the other obligations
of the Company hereunder, including by confirming in writing its irrevocable
commitment to waive the breach of this Agreement that gave rise to the
obligation to deposit the Breach Escrow Amount into the Breach Escrow Account,
such waiver to be effective at the Closing (subject to the occurrence
thereof).

Termination Fee under _Section 7.3(c)_ , Parent and the Company shall execute
a joint written instruction directing the Escrow Agent to make a cash payment

7.5 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may
be amended by the agreement of the Company and Parent by action taken by or on
behalf of their respective boards of directors (or equivalent governing
bodies) at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,

8.11 _Governing Law ; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

  

  

(a) This Agreement and all claims and causes of action based upon, arising out
of or in connection herewith shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to Laws that may be
applicable under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware ( _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Merger, the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
the Company and the internal corporate affairs of the Company shall in each
case be governed by North Dakota law); _provided_ , _however_ , each of the
parties hereto (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates) agrees that any claim,
controversy or dispute of any kind or nature (whether based upon contract,
tort or otherwise) to which a Parent Financing Source is a party and that is
in any way related to any Debt Commitment Letter, this Agreement, the
Transactions or the Financing, including but not limited to any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New

extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
laws of another jurisdiction, _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that any matter to which a Parent
Financing Source is a party that is related to a Company Material Adverse
Effect, the interpretation of representations and warranties under this

accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws

\- 92 -  

  

(b) Each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such Court does not have

effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such Proceeding in any such court, and (iv) waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such Proceeding in any such court. Each of the parties
agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and
may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section 8.3_.
Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement
to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, and in all cases subject to _Section 8.15_ , each of the parties

dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any Debt Commitment Letter,
the commitments contained therein or the performance thereof or the Debt
Financing contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York in the County of New York
(and the appellate courts thereof), and (y) that the provisions of _Section
8.11(c)_ (relating to the waiver of jury trial) shall apply to any such

parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any right such
party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation (whether in Law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise) directly or
indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to any Debt Commitment
Letter, the commitments contained therein or the performance thereof or the
Debt Financing contemplated thereby.

  

 

\- 93 -  

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARENT FINANCING SOURCES, THE DEBT
COMMITMENT LETTERS AND/OR THE DEBT FINANCING IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY PROCEEDING
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, THE TRANSACTIONS OR THE
FINANCING, THE PARENT FINANCING SOURCES, THE DEBT COMMITMENT LETTERS AND/OR
THE DEBT FINANCING. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.11(c)_.

  

  

8.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

8.13 _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

  

  

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies
provided herein will be deemed cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any
other remedy conferred hereby, or at law or in equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. The parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties do not perform their respective obligations under
the provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as
are required of them hereunder to consummate the Financing and other
Transactions) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such
provisions. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to the valid termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , subject to this _Section 8.13_ ,
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(including the obligation of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the Merger if such party is required to do so hereunder, including the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under _Section 5.16(d)_ , and including
the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger Sub to fully enforce the
terms of the Equity Commitment Letter against the Sponsor to the fullest
extent permissible under this _Section 8.13_ and the Equity Commitment Letter,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter) without
posting a bond or other undertaking, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. The pursuit of
specific performance by any party at any time will not be deemed an election
of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy to
which such party may be entitled. If a court of competent jurisdiction has
declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent to consummate the
Transactions pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against
Parent, and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged breach,
the Company may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach
on behalf of its stockholders. The parties acknowledge that the provisions
contained in this _Section 8.13_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of the Company and constitute a material inducement to
the Company to enter into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing and
subject to the rights of the parties to the Debt Commitment Letters under the
terms thereof, and in any case subject to and not in limitation of _Section
8.15_ , none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or its and their direct
and indirect stockholders shall have any rights or claims (whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise) against any Parent Financing Source, solely in their
respective capacities as lenders or arrangers in connection with the Debt
Financing.

  

 

\- 94 -  

  

(b) It is explicitly agreed that the Company shall have the right to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedies in connection
with enforcing Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger
and cause Parent and Merger Sub to enforce Sponsor's obligation to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded only in the event that each of the following
conditions has been satisfied: (i) the Marketing Period has ended and the
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied
on the Closing, provided that each such condition is capable of being
satisfied at Closing) at the time the Closing would have occurred but for the
failure of Parent and Merger Sub to complete the Closing by the date that the
Closing is required to have occurred, (ii) the Debt Financing (or any
Alternative Financing contemplated by _Section 5.16(d)_ ) is available to be
funded at the Closing and has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if
the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has
irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (x) all conditions to the
Company's obligations to consummate the Closing set forth in _Section 6.1_ and
_Section 6.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that
by their nature can only be satisfied on the Closing, provided that each such
condition is capable of being satisfied at Closing) and (y) if specific
performance is granted and the Financing is funded, then the Closing will
occur.

  

  

8.14 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or
otherwise, the parties hereto agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, that no Non-Recourse Party in
respect of such parties shall have any liability under this Agreement (it
being understood that if any individual party hereto is a Non-Recourse Party
in respect of another individual party hereto, this limitation shall not be
read to affect any such liability of such individual party itself); provided,
however, that nothing herein shall limit the obligations of any Non-Recourse
Party under any Ancillary Agreement to which such Non-Recourse Party is party,
including, without limitation, the Guarantee or the Equity Commitment Letter,
even if the basis for obligations thereunder relate to or arise from
obligations hereunder.

  

 

\- 95 -  

  

8.15 _Financing Source Matters_. Each of the parties hereto agree that the
Parent Financing Sources (including any Non-Recourse Parties in respect
thereof) shall not have any liability or obligation (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute or otherwise) to the Company,
or any of its former, current or future officers, directors, managers,
employees, member, partners, agents and other representatives and Affiliates
and their direct and indirect security holders (collectively, the " _Company-
Related Parties_ "), and the Company hereby waives on behalf of the Company-
Related Parties, and the Company-Related Parties collectively are hereby
deemed to waive, any rights and claims (whether in contract or in tort, in law
or in equity, or granted by statute or otherwise) for any liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever arising under, out
of, in connection with or related in any manner to this Agreement or any Debt
Commitment Letter or based on, in respect of or by reason of this Agreement or
any Debt Commitment Letter or the negotiation, execution, performance (whether
willfully, intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise) or breach thereof, or
in respect of any oral representation made or alleged to be have been made in
connection herewith or therewith; and no Company-Related Party shall seek or
be entitled to recover any money damages (including consequential, special,
indirect or punitive damages, or damages on account of a willful and material
breach) or obtain any equitable relief from or with respect to any Parent
Financing Source; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 8.15_ shall limit
the liability or obligations of the Parent Financing Sources to Parent (and
its successors and assigns) and/or the other parties to the Debt Financing
under the Debt Commitment Letters (or any fee letters referred to therein).

Merger Agreement) shall be merged with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the surviving corporation thereafter (the " _Merger_ ");

  


 

  

WHEREAS, the adoption of the Merger Agreement requires the written consent or

VOTING AGREEMENT

  


 

  

SECTION 2.1 _Agreement to Vote_. The Stockholder hereby agrees that, during
the Voting Period, the Stockholder shall, and the Beneficial Owners agree that
they shall cause the applicable holder of their Subject Shares to, (a) if a
meeting of stockholders of the Company is held, appear at the meeting, in
person or by proxy, and vote (or cause to be voted), and if an action is to be

or by operation of Law) with respect to, or consent to or permit, a Transfer

action inconsistent with this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Each Stockholder Party agrees

Section 8. _Indemnification_ :

authorized or permitted by applicable law any person (his heirs, executors and
administrators) who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to
any threatened, pending or completed civil, criminal, administrative,
arbitration, or investigative proceeding, including without limitation a
proceeding by or in the right of the Corporation, by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while
serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director or officer or in any other capacity
for another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, against all expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,
penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in connection with such proceeding if, with respect to
the acts or omissions of such person, such person (i) acted in good faith,
(ii) received no improper personal benefit, (iii) with respect to any criminal
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful, and
(iv) reasonably believed that the conduct was in the best interest of the
Corporation (or if, at the Corporation's request, such person served for
another organization, reasonably believed that the conduct was not opposed to
the best interest of the Corporation). The termination of any proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere
or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person
did not satisfy the criteria of the preceding sentence.

  


 

  

The Corporation may indemnify any person who is or was an employee or agent of
the Corporation, or any person who is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as an employee or agent or in any other capacity of another
corporation, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, in the manner and to
the extent that it shall indemnify any director or officer under this Section
8.

  


 

  

(b) _Determination of Indemnification_. Any indemnification under Section 8(a)
(unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as
authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of
the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances
because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
Section 8(a). Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors
by a majority of a quorum, not counting any directors who are at the time
parties to the proceeding for determining either a majority or the presence of
a quorum, (ii) if a quorum under clause (i) of this Section 8(b) cannot be
obtained, by a majority of a committee or by a majority of a committee of the
Board of Directors, consisting solely of two or more directors not at the time
parties to the proceeding, duly designated to act in the matter by a majority
of the full Board of Directors, including directors who are parties, (iii) by
a special legal counsel, or (iv) as otherwise provided by the North Dakota
Business Corporation Act or the North Dakota Publicly Traded Corporations Act,
as applicable.

  

 

D-10  

 

  

(c) _Right to Indemnification_. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Section 8, to the extent that a director or officer of the Corporation has
been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding referred to in Section 8(a), or in defense of any claim, issue or
matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including
attorney's fees) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection
therewith.

  


 

  

(d) _Advance of Expenses_. Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal
proceeding may be paid by the Corporation on behalf of a director, officer,
employee or agent in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding as authorized by the Board of Directors in the specific case upon
(i) receipt of written affirmation by the person of a good-faith belief that
the applicable criteria for indemnification have been satisfied and a written
undertaking by the person to repay all amounts so paid or reimbursed by the
Corporation, if the ultimate determination is that the criteria for
indemnification have not been satisfied, and (ii) after a determination that
the facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude
indemnification.

  


 

  

(e) _Indemnification Not Exclusive_. The indemnification provided by this
Section 8 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which any
person seeking indemnification may be entitled under any law, any agreement,
the Articles of Incorporation, any vote of shareholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise, both as to action in such person's official capacity
and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a person.

  


 

  

(f) _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf
of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted
against such person and incurred by such person in any such capacity, or
arising out of such person's status as such, whether or not the Corporation
would have the power to indemnify such person against liability under the
provisions of this Section 8.

  


 

  

(g) _Continuity_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided for
in this Section 8 shall, unless otherwise provided when authorized or
ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation and shall inure to the benefit of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.
