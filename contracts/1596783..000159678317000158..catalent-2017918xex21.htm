ARTICLE III

Purchase and Sale of Company Interests

Section 3.1 Purchase and Sale of Company Interests. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer shall purchase
from Seller, and Seller shall sell, transfer and assign to Buyer, free and
clear of all Liens, the Company Interests. The Company Interests purchased and
sold pursuant to this Section 3.1 shall constitute one hundred percent (100%)
of the outstanding Equity Securities of the Company.

Section 3.2 Purchase Price; Payments at the Closing.

(a)The purchase price to be paid by Buyer to Seller for the Company Interests
shall be nine hundred fifty million dollars ($950,000,000) (the "Base Purchase
Price"), subject to adjustment as provided in this Article III (the Base
Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to Section 3.3 and Section 3.4, the
"Purchase Price").

(b)Not fewer than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, Seller shall
deliver to Buyer a written statement (the "Closing Date Statement") setting
forth Seller's good faith estimate of the Closing Date Working Capital
("Estimated Closing Date Working Capital"), and either (i) the amount, if any,
by which such estimate exceeds Target Working Capital (any such amount, an
"Estimated Working Capital Excess") or (ii) the amount, if any, by which such
estimate 

is less than Target Working Capital (any such amount, an "Estimated Working
Capital Deficit"). The Closing Date Statement shall also include Seller's good
faith estimate of Closing Date Cash (the "Estimated Closing Cash Amount"),
Closing Date Indebtedness (the "Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount") and
Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Closing Date Company
Transaction Expenses"). The Closing Date Statement shall describe in
reasonable detail the nature of such estimates, including the basis for the
specific items involved and the dollar amounts thereof.

(c)At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller the Closing
Consideration Amount. "Closing Consideration Amount" means the Base Purchase
Price, less (i) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, less (ii) the Subsequent Payment
Amount, less (iii) the Exclusivity Payment Amount, less (iv) the amount of any
Estimated Working Capital Deficit, plus (v) the Estimated Closing Cash Amount,
less (vi) the Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount, less (vii) the Estimated
Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses. The Closing Consideration Amount
shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by Seller. Such account shall be designated no fewer than three (3)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(d)At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Pay-Off Amount as
set forth in the Pay-Off Letters (including all amounts necessary to discharge
Indebtedness guaranteed by the Company in connection with the Parent Credit
Agreement), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
designated in the Pay-Off Letters.

(e)At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Company
Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing Date Statement to the payees
thereof, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts
designated in advance by each payee thereof, as set forth on the Closing Date
Statement.

(f)From 11:59 P.M. on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and until
the consummation of the Closing, the Company shall not (i) use any Company
Cash to pay any Company Transaction Expenses, pay any distributions or to
repay any Indebtedness or (ii) incur any Indebtedness.

Section 3.3 Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination.

(a)After the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and, within ninety (90) days after
the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller, a statement setting forth Buyer's
determination of (i) Closing Date Working Capital, (ii) Closing Date Cash,
(iii) Closing Date Indebtedness and (iv) Closing Date Company Transaction
Expenses, which statement shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of
such determination, including the basis for the specific items involved and
the dollar amounts thereof (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Statement").

(b)If Seller disagrees in good faith with the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement within
thirty (30) days after delivery of the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement,
which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of such
disagreement, including the specific items involved and the dollar amounts
thereof (a "Purchase Price Dispute Notice"). During such thirty (30) day
period, Seller shall be 

permitted reasonable access to the Company's Books and Records and
Representatives for the purpose of reviewing the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement during normal business hours in a manner so as to not unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of the Company. For purposes of
clarity, a statement to the effect that Seller objects to, or disagrees with,
the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement without specifying the items required
to be set forth in a Purchase Price Dispute Notice, shall not constitute a
valid Purchase Price Dispute Notice. Once delivered, Seller may not modify or
amend the Purchase Price Dispute Notice except to waive all or any portion of
such disagreement. If Seller does not deliver a valid Purchase Price Dispute
Notice within such thirty (30) day period, the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement, as delivered by Buyer to Seller, shall be the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement. If Seller delivers a valid Purchase Price Dispute Notice
within such thirty (30) day period, then such disputed amounts (the "Disputed
Amounts") shall be resolved pursuant to Section 3.3(c).

(c)Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any Disputed
Amounts and, if the parties are able to resolve all Disputed Amounts, the
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as modified to reflect such resolution,
shall be the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. If Buyer and Seller
are unable to resolve all Disputed Amounts within thirty (30) days after
delivery of a Purchase Price Dispute Notice, then the Disputed Amounts may be
referred by either Buyer or Seller for final determination to
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (such firm, or another firm determined pursuant to
this Section 3.3(c), the "Accounting Arbitrator") within fifteen (15) days
after the end of such thirty (30) day period. If neither party refers the
Disputed Amounts to the Accounting Arbitrator within the applicable fifteen
(15) day period, then the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as delivered by
Buyer to Seller, shall be the final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. If
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has any material relationship with Buyer, Seller or
any of their respective Affiliates, or is otherwise unwilling or unable to
serve, Buyer and Seller shall jointly appoint as the Accounting Arbitrator a
different nationally or regionally recognized firm of independent certified
public accountants, which does not have any material relationship with Buyer,
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates. If Buyer and Seller are unable
to agree upon an alternative Accounting Arbitrator within fifteen (15) days
after the conclusion of the thirty (30) day period initially specified above,
then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be an accounting firm of national
standing designated by the American Arbitration Association in New York, New
York (which does not have any material relationship with Buyer, Seller or any
of their respective Affiliates). The Accounting Arbitrator shall consider only
those Disputed Amounts which Buyer and Seller have been unable to resolve. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall make its determination based solely on
presentations and supporting materials provided by Buyer and Seller, and not
pursuant to any independent review. Buyer and Seller shall contemporaneously
provide copies to one another of all written submissions to the Accounting
Arbitrator and shall be permitted to attend (and shall receive reasonable
advance written notice of) any meeting with or presentations to the Accounting
Arbitrator. Buyer and Seller shall each use reasonable best efforts to make
their presentations as promptly as practicable following submission to the
Accounting Arbitrator of the disputed items (but in no event later than
fifteen (15) days after engagement of the Accounting Arbitrator), and Buyer
and Seller shall each be entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to
the presentation of the other party and any questions and requests of the
Accounting Arbitrator. In deciding any matter or item in dispute, the
Accounting Arbitrator (A) shall be bound by the provisions of this Section
3.3(c) and (B) shall not assign a value to any particular item greater than
the greatest value for such 

item claimed by either Buyer or Seller, or less than the lowest value for such
item claimed by either Seller or Buyer, in each case as presented to the
Accounting Arbitrator. No party shall disclose to the Accounting Arbitrator,
and the Accounting Arbitrator shall not consider for any purpose, any
settlement discussions or settlement offer made by any party, unless otherwise
agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller. The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver
to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within sixty
(60) days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution
of such Disputed Amounts. The findings and determinations of the Accounting
Arbitrator as set forth in its written report shall be deemed final,
conclusive and binding upon the parties. The parties shall be entitled to seek
to have a judgment entered on such written report of the Accounting Arbitrator
in any court of competent jurisdiction. Upon the decision of the Accounting
Arbitrator, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as adjusted to the extent
necessary to reflect the Accounting Arbitrator's decision, shall be the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Arbitrator shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based on the inverse of the percentage
that the Accounting Arbitrator's determination (before such allocation) bears
to the Disputed Amount as originally submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator.
For example, should the items in dispute total an amount equal to one thousand
dollars ($1,000) and the Accounting Arbitrator awards six hundred dollars
($600) in favor of Seller's position, sixty percent (60%) of the costs of its
review would be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and forty percent (40%) of
the costs would be borne by Seller, on the other hand.

Section 3.4 Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment.

(a)In the event that the Closing Date Working Capital as reflected on the
Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement is greater than the Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to the
difference; provided that, if the (i) Estimated Closing Date Working Capital
was less than Target Working Capital as of the Closing Date and (ii) Closing
Date Working Capital as reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement is equal to or greater than Target Working Capital, then the amount
paid by Buyer to Seller under this Section 3.4(a) shall not exceed the
difference between the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital and the Target
Working Capital. In the event that Closing Date Working Capital as reflected
on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement is less than the Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital, Buyer shall be entitled to payment from Seller
of such difference or, without duplication, out of the Adjustment Escrow
Account, and if the Adjustment Escrow Account is depleted in connection with
the foregoing or the other payments made pursuant to this Section 3.4(a), the
remainder of such amount from Seller; provided that, if the (i) Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital was equal to or greater than Target Working
Capital as of the Closing Date and (ii) Closing Date Working Capital as
reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement is less than Target
Working Capital, then the amount paid by Seller to Buyer under this Section
3.4(a) shall equal the difference between the Target Working Capital and the
Closing Date Working Capital as reflected on the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement. In the event that the Closing Date Working Capital as
reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement is equal to the
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, no adjustment will be due. For the
avoidance of doubt, if both the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital and the
Closing Date Working Capital as reflected on the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment 

Statement are equal to or greater than the Target Working Capital, no
adjustment shall be required pursuant to this Section 3.4(a).

(b)In the event that the Closing Date Cash as reflected on the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement is greater than the Estimated Closing Cash Amount,
Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to the difference. In the event that
the Closing Date Cash as reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement is less than the Estimated Closing Cash Amount, Buyer shall be
entitled to a payment from Seller or, without duplication, out of the
Adjustment Escrow Account, and if the Adjustment Escrow Account is depleted in
connection with the foregoing or the other payments made pursuant to this
Section 3.4, the remainder of such amount from Seller. In the event that the
Closing Date Cash as reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement is equal to the Estimated Closing Cash Amount, no adjustment will be
due.

(c)In the event that the Closing Date Indebtedness as reflected on the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement is greater than the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness Amount, Buyer shall be entitled to a payment from Seller or,
without duplication, out of the Adjustment Escrow Account, and if the
Adjustment Escrow Account is depleted in connection with the foregoing or the
other payments made pursuant to this Section 3.4, the remainder of such amount
from Seller. In the event that the Closing Date Indebtedness as reflected on
the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement is less than the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness Amount, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to the
difference. In the event that the Closing Date Indebtedness as reflected on
the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement is equal to the Estimated
Closing Indebtedness Amount, no adjustment will be due.

(d)In the event that the Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses as
reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement are greater than
the Estimated Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses, Buyer shall be
entitled to a payment from Seller or, without duplication, out of the
Adjustment Escrow Account, and if the Adjustment Escrow Account is depleted in
connection with the foregoing or the other payments made pursuant to this
Section 3.4, the remainder of such amount from Seller. In the event that the
Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses as reflected on the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement are less than the Estimated Closing Date Company
Transaction Expenses, Buyer shall pay Seller an amount equal to the
difference. In the event that the Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses as
reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement are equal to the
Estimated Closing Date Company Transaction Expenses, no adjustment will be
due.

(e)Any amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.4 shall be paid within two
(2) Business Days after final determination of the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in advance by the party receiving the payment. If Buyer is
entitled to any payment, on the one hand, and Seller is also entitled to any
payment, on the other hand, in each case pursuant to this Section 3.4, then
such payments shall be netted against each other for purposes of determining
the aggregate net amount payable to Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the
other hand, as applicable. 

(f)Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, agree to treat any
payment made pursuant to this Section 3.4 as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

Section 3.5 Escrowed Portion of the Purchase Price; Subsequent Payment Amount.

(a)At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver four million five hundred thousand
dollars ($4,500,000) (the "Adjustment Escrow Amount") to the Escrow Agent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account referred to herein
as the Adjustment Escrow Account (the "Adjustment Escrow Account") that will
be designated and administered by the Escrow Agent pursuant to that certain
Escrow Agreement, dated as of the Closing Date, by and among Buyer, Seller and
the Escrow Agent, substantially in the form and on terms and conditions as set
forth in Exhibit B attached hereto (the "Escrow Agreement").

(b)After the Closing, Buyer shall pay the Subsequent Payment Amount to Seller
as follows: (i) a portion of the Subsequent Payment Amount equal to fifty
million dollars ($50,000,000) on the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, (ii) a portion of the Subsequent Payment Amount equal to fifty
million dollars ($50,000,000) on the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, (iii) a portion of the Subsequent Payment Amount equal to fifty
million dollars ($50,000,000) on the thirty-six (36) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, and (iv) a portion of the Subsequent Payment Amount equal to
fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) on the forty-eight (48) month anniversary
of the Closing Date. The payments to be made pursuant to this Section 3.5(b)
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in advance by Seller.

(c)Seller and Buyer agree to treat each payment of the Adjustment Escrow
Amount and the Subsequent Payment Amount made pursuant to this Section 3.5 as
(i) additional Purchase Price for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and (ii)
composed of an interest element and a principal element, such interest element
to be determined and reported consistent with Section 483 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder.

or by which the Company or any of its properties is bound or affected, or (c)

sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2016, and the related audited
statements of income, parent company net investment in the Company and cash
flows for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 (the "Most Recent Audited
Financial Statements") and (ii) the unaudited balance sheet of the Company as
of June 30, 2017 and the related unaudited statements of income and cash
flows, respectively, for the six (6) month period ended on such date and the
comparable prior year period (such June 30, 2017 statements, the "Most Recent
Unaudited Financial Statements").

(b)Each of the Financial Statements has been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a basis consistent with prior periods and fairly presents in all
material respects the financial condition of the Company as of its respective
date and the statements of income, parent company net investment, or cash
flows, as the case may be, of the Company for the period covered thereby,
subject, in the case of the Most Recent Unaudited Financial Statements, to
customary year-end and audit adjustments (none of which are reasonably
expected to be, in the aggregate, material) and the absence of footnote
disclosure.

(c)The Company has established and maintains a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are
executed in accordance with management's general or specific authorizations
and with applicable Law, (ii) transactions, including transactions between the
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand, are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability therein, (iii)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or
specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any difference, except, in the case of each of
(i) through (iv), for any deficiency that, individually or in the aggregate,
is insignificant. Neither the Company nor, to the Knowledge of the Company,
Seller, has received any advice or notification from its or Seller's
independent accountant or auditor that would have the effect of not reflecting
or incorrectly reflecting, in the Business Records of the Company, any
material properties, assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, equity accounts
or other accounts. 

Section 5.7 Business Records.

(a)The Business Records have been maintained in accordance with the Company's
customary business practices and fairly and accurately reflect, in all
material respects, on a basis consistent with past periods and throughout the
periods involved, all transactions and dispositions of the Company.

(b)None of Seller, the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any of
their respective Representatives, has received or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or Claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the
Company or its internal accounting controls, including any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or Claim that the Company has engaged in questionable or
improper accounting practices, practices that are contrary to GAAP or
questionable or improper behavior in connection with any audit.

Section 5.8 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as reflected in the Most Recent
Audited Financial Statements, the Company does not have any Liabilities
(whether or not the subject of any other representation or warranty hereunder)
except for Liabilities that may have arisen in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice since the date of the Most Recent Audited
Financial Statements and which are not, and would not reasonably be expected
to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company.

Section 5.9 Absence of Certain Changes. Since the date of the Most Recent
Audited Financial Statements: (a) the Company has conducted the Business in
the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice, and (b)
there has not been any Event that has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of the Most Recent
Unaudited Financial Statements, the Company has not taken any action that, if
taken after the date of this Agreement, would constitute a breach of any of
the covenants set forth in Section 7.1.

Section 5.10 Arrangements with Affiliates. Except for the activities
contemplated and intended to be continued following the Closing through either
the commercial supply agreement and corresponding quality agreement with
respect to the in vitro fertilization media manufactured by the Company on
behalf of Seller and/or its Affiliates (the "IVF Media Supply Agreement") or

of the fully executed commitment letter, dated as of September 18, 2017,

the Accounting Arbitrator in accordance with Section 3.3(c); provided,
however, that if such dispute remains unresolved by the due date of such Pre-
Closing Return, the Buyer may file such Pre-Closing Return reflecting the
Buyer\'s position and shall file an amendment to such Tax Return if the
Accounting Arbitrator subsequently determines that such amendment is required.
Buyer shall timely file all such Pre-Closing Returns as finally prepared
pursuant to this Section 7.2(a)(ii). Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal
to all Taxes of the Company reflected on any such Pre-Closing Return in excess
of the accrual for such Taxes included in the Closing Date Working Capital as
determined under Section 3.4 at least five (5) Business Days before the date
on which Buyer or the Company is required to pay such Taxes.

(iii)Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax
Returns of the Company that relate to any Straddle Period and shall pay or
cause to be paid the Taxes reflected as due on such Tax Returns. Seller shall
pay to Buyer, no later than five (5) Business Days before such Taxes are due,
the Pre-Closing Date Share of any such Taxes in excess of the accrual for such
Taxes included in the Closing Date Working Capital as determined under Section
3.4. Buyer shall provide each such material Tax Return to Seller for review
and comment no later than twenty (20) before the due date of such Tax Return,
and Buyer shall consider in good faith any written comments to such Tax Return
received from Seller.

(b)Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by any party, in connection with (i) the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Section 7.2, (ii) any other Tax Returns required to be filed
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (including required
filings under Section 6043 or Section 6043A of the Code or the Treasury
Regulations thereunder), and (iii) any Tax Contest. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of
Business Records and information reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or
Tax Contest and making Employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Buyer and Seller shall (A) retain all Business Records with respect
to Tax matters pertinent to the Company and the Company's assets or
activities, as applicable, relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the
extent notified by Buyer or Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective
taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into
with any Taxing Authority and (B) give the other party reasonable written
notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such Business
Records and, if the other party so requests, Buyer or Seller, as the case may
be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such Business Records.
The Company and Seller acknowledge that no provision of this Agreement
requires Buyer to provide any party any right to access or review any Tax
Return or Tax work papers of Buyer or any Affiliate thereof (other than the
Company). 

(c)Asset Allocation.

(i)Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare an
allocation (the "Asset Allocation") of the Closing Consideration Amount (and
all other amounts treated as consideration for the purchase of the assets of
the Company for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) among the assets of the
Company, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, and any comparable provisions of state,
local or other Tax Law, and shall deliver the Asset Allocation to Seller.
Seller shall have twenty (20) days to provide comments in writing to Buyer,
which Buyer shall consider in good faith. Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in
good faith to finalize the Asset Allocation (unless Seller does not provide
any comment within such twenty-day period, in which case Buyer's determination
of the Asset Allocation shall be deemed final). If the parties agree to such
Asset Allocation, or it shall be deemed final pursuant to the prior sentence,
then Buyer, the Company, and Seller shall, unless required pursuant to a
determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code, (A) file
all Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) consistent with the Asset
Allocation, (B) not take any action inconsistent therewith upon any audit or
examination of any Tax Return or in any other filing or proceeding relating to
Taxes, and (C) cooperate in case of a challenge by a Taxing Authority to the
Asset Allocation; otherwise, the parties shall have no further obligation
under this Section 7.2(c), and each party shall make its own determination in
good faith of such allocation for financial and tax reporting purposes, which
determination, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be binding on the other
party.

(ii)Buyer shall promptly revise the Asset Allocation to reflect (A)
adjustments to the Closing Consideration Amount pursuant to this Agreement
(including pursuant to Section 3.4), and (B) any payments of the Adjustment
Escrow Amount or the Subsequent Payment Amount.

(d)Seller shall be responsible for and shall pay any and all Transfer Taxes.
Seller shall timely prepare all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and shall provide a draft copy of such
Tax Returns and other documentation to Buyer at least ten (10) days prior to
the due date for such Tax Returns for Buyer's review and comment. Seller shall
timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all such Tax Returns, and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with Seller as may be necessary to effectuate such
filings, and, if required by applicable Law, Buyer will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

(e)All Tax sharing, indemnification or allocation agreements or similar
Contracts with respect to or involving the Company shall be terminated no
later than the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company shall not
be bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder. The Company and Seller
shall take all actions necessary to terminate such Contracts prior to Closing.

(f)Following the Closing, if Buyer receives a notice of any Tax Contest
involving the Taxes of the Company with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period,
Buyer shall notify Seller within ten (10) days, and Seller shall control, at
Seller's expense, such Tax Contest, to the extent relating to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period. Seller shall (i) keep Buyer reasonably informed with 

respect to such Tax Contest, (ii) consider in good faith Buyer's comments to
Seller regarding the conduct of or positions taken in such Tax Contest, and
(iii) with respect to any such Tax Contest that will result in an adverse
effect to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, not enter into any settlement or
compromise of such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of Buyer,
which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed, or withheld

(g)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, prior to the Closing, the
Company shall make all Tax payments, including all estimated Tax payments that
would be made in the ordinary course of business or be required by Law.

(h)Seller shall not make, or permit any of its Affiliates (including the
Company) to make, any election under Treasury Regulations § 301.7701-3 (or any
analogous or similar state or local Law or regulation), as a result of which
the Company would not be treated as an entity disregarded as separate from its
owner pursuant to Treasury Regulations § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) (or any analogous
or similar state or local Law or regulation).

(i)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer, the Company and the
Escrow Agent may, upon prior written notice, deduct and withhold any required
Taxes from any payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent
that any such amount is so withheld, such withheld amount shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

(j)On the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer an affidavit of non-
foreign status certified by Seller under penalties of perjury and dated as of
the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and
meeting the requirements of Treasury Regulations § 1.1445-2(b)(2).

(k)Following the Closing, Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold Seller
harmless from any and all Losses, including, but not limited to, any refunds,
repayments or clawbacks of previously received incentive payments or other
amounts that any Seller Indemnitee may incur solely as a result of the
Company's failure to perform, comply with and fulfill all obligations and
requirements of the Company under any Tax Incentive Agreement (including
requirements relating to employment, wages or maintenance of operations)
required to be performed, complied with or fulfilled after the Closing in
order to maintain the incentives provided therein.

Section 7.3 Access to Information Prior to the Closing. During the period from
the date hereof through the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms and the Closing Date, the Company shall, and Seller
shall cause the Company to, give (a) Buyer and its authorized Representatives
and (b) the Financing Sources and their authorized Representatives, in each
case, reasonable access during regular business hours to all offices, Real
Property, and Business Records of the Company as Buyer or any of the Financing
Sources may reasonably request. With respect to any such access or visit, (i)
Buyer and its Representatives, and Financing Sources and their authorized
Representatives, shall in each case take such action as is deemed necessary in
the reasonable judgment of the Company and Seller to schedule such access or
visits through a designated officer of the Company and in such a way as to
avoid disrupting in any material respect the normal business of the Company
and (ii) the Company shall not be required to take any action 

that would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege or to
disclose information that is deemed in the reasonable judgment of the Company
to be of a highly competitive and sensitive nature; provided, however, that
with respect to any information that the Company deems privileged or highly
competitive and sensitive in the case of clause (ii), Seller and Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all such
alternative actions or things necessary, proper or advisable to make such
information available.

Section 7.4 Confidentiality.

(a)The Confidentiality Agreement is terminated as of the date hereof and is of
no further force or effect.

(b)During the period from the date hereof through the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and the Closing
Date, Buyer shall, and shall cause its controlled Representatives to keep the
Confidential Information confidential and not disclose any of it to any Person
in any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that Buyer may (i) make any
disclosure of the Confidential Information to which Seller gives its prior
written consent, (ii) disclose any of such information to its respective
controlled Representatives who need to know such information and who are
advised of the confidentiality obligations that attach to the Confidential
Information (it being agreed that Buyer will be responsible for any violation
of the provisions of this Section 7.4(b) by any of its controlled
Representatives), and (iii) disclose that information which, on the advice of
counsel, is required to be disclosed by Law or pursuant to a demand of any
Governmental Authority (which requirement or demand shall not have been caused
by any act of Buyer or its controlled Representatives in violation of this
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Buyer or any of
its controlled Representatives are required to or believe they are required by
Law to disclose any of the Confidential Information, such party shall, to the
extent legally permissible, provide Seller with prompt written notice of any
such requirement so that Seller may seek (at its cost and expense) a
protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement; provided that, in the event that such protective
order or other appropriate remedy or waiver by Seller is not obtained or
granted, and Buyer or its controlled Representatives are nonetheless, on the
advice of counsel, required by Law to disclose Confidential Information, Buyer
or its controlled Representatives may disclose to, or as required by, the
applicable Governmental Authority, only that portion of the Confidential
Information that such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed (and
any such disclosure shall be made only to such Persons to whom such counsel
advises such information is legally required to be disclosed); provided that
Buyer and its controlled Representatives exercise reasonable best efforts (at
their cost and expense) to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information, including by reasonably cooperating with Seller to obtain an
appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.

(c)Following the Closing for a period of five (5) years, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, (i) keep the Confidential Information
confidential and not disclose any of it to any Person in any manner
whatsoever, and (ii) not use the Confidential Information directly or
indirectly in any way detrimental to the Company or its Affiliates; provided,
however, that Seller may (A) make any disclosure of the Confidential
Information to which Buyer gives its prior written 

consent, (B) disclose any of such information to its Representatives who need
to know such information and who are advised of the confidentiality
obligations that attach to the Confidential Information (it being agreed that
Seller will be responsible for any violation of the provisions of this Section
7.4(c) by any of its Representatives), and (C) disclose that information
which, on the advice of its counsel, is required to be disclosed by Law or
pursuant to a demand of any Governmental Authority (which requirement or
demand shall not have been caused by any act of Seller or its Representatives
in violation of this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event
that Seller or its Representatives are required to or believe they are
required by Law to disclose any of the Confidential Information, such party
shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide Buyer with prompt written
notice of any such requirement so that Buyer and the Company may seek (at
their cost and expense) a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or
waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided that in the
event that such protective order or other appropriate remedy or waiver by
Buyer is not obtained or granted, and Seller or any of its Representatives is
nonetheless, on the advice of counsel, required by Law to disclose
Confidential Information, Seller or its applicable Representative (x) may
disclose to, or as required by, the applicable Governmental Authority only
that portion of the Confidential Information which such counsel advises is
legally required to be disclosed (and any such disclosure shall be made only
to such Persons to whom such counsel advises such information is legally
required to be disclosed); and (y) shall exercise reasonable best efforts (at
its cost and expense) to preserve the confidentiality of any such disclosed
Confidential Information, including by reasonably cooperating with Buyer and
the Company to obtain (at their cost and expense) an appropriate
confidentiality order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded the Confidential Information.

Section 7.5 Public Announcements. The initial press releases regarding this
Agreement shall be made at such times and in such forms as Buyer and Seller
agree. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of Buyer or Seller shall be
permitted to make any disclosure that may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any exchange to which it is subject; provided that the party
proposing to issue any press release or similar public announcement or
communication in compliance with any such disclosure obligations shall use
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
doing so. Following the initial press releases, none of Buyer, the Company or
Seller or any of its or their respective Affiliates shall issue or make any
subsequent press release or public statement with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby containing any substantive information in
addition to that previously permitted to be disclosed pursuant to this Section
7.5 without the prior written consent of Buyer and Seller, except as (a) may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange to
which it is subject or (b) consistent with any previous internal or external
public disclosures regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby (including pursuant to any communications plan agreed to between Buyer
and Seller prior to such disclosure); provided that, in respect of clause (a),
the party proposing to issue any press release or similar public announcement
or communication in compliance with any such disclosure obligations shall use
reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before
doing so.

Section 7.7 Employee Matters.

(a)For a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date (or, if earlier,
until the date of termination of the relevant employee), Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Company to, 

provide to each individual who, immediately prior to the Closing, is an
employee of the Company and who continues in such capacity immediately
following the Closing (each, a "Continuing Employee"): (i) a total
compensation opportunity (including base salary or hourly wage rate, deferred
compensation and, to the extent applicable, cash incentive opportunity and/or
long-term incentive opportunity (including equity incentive awards)) that is
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the total compensation
opportunity (including base salary or hourly wage rate, deferred compensation
and, to the extent applicable, cash incentive opportunity and/or long-term
incentive opportunity), provided by the Company to the Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) medical and prescription drug plan
benefits that are at least substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
those provided to the Continuing Employees by Seller or the Company
immediately prior to the Closing and (iii) all other employee benefits that
are at least substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Buyer (or a Subsidiary); provided that, if the
parties mutually agree in writing, in their respective sole discretions, to
extend the right of participation by such Continuing Employee in any coverage
available for such Continuing Employees under one or more Plans of Seller
immediately prior to Closing for a specified period following the Closing (the
"Coverage Transition Period"), continued participation by such Continuing
Employee in the coverage under such Plan shall satisfy this clause (iii) for
the Coverage Transition Period; and provided, further, that after Closing,
Buyer shall have no obligation to pay premiums under any universal life
policies owned by Employees. Buyer (or a Subsidiary thereof) shall provide
each Continuing Employee with credit for all periods of service with Seller,
the Company or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates under each Buyer Plan
in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate, except (x) for
any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA, any frozen or grandfathered Plan, or
any plan, program or policy providing retiree health or life benefits, and (y)
to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of benefits with
respect to the same period of service.

(b)With respect to all Continuing Employees, Buyer shall, subject to Seller
providing Buyer with accurate and timely data, to the extent permitted by
ERISA: (i) waive or cause to be waived all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such Continuing Employees under any new or
revised welfare benefit Plan maintained by Buyer, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates (each such Plan, a "Buyer Plan") in which such
Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible to participate, except to the extent
that such conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
Continuing Employee's then-existing coverage immediately prior to Closing, and
(ii) provide or cause to be provided each Continuing Employee with credit for
any co-payments, coinsurance and deductibles paid prior to the Closing in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket maximum requirements
under any Buyer Plan in which such Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate, except to the extent that the receipt of such credit would result
in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service.
Effective no later than 11:59:59 p.m. on the day of Closing, Seller shall
amend each of its welfare benefit Plans as applicable to provide that the
Company shall no longer be a participating employer. Seller shall provide

general purpose and limited purpose health flexible spending accounts to
Continuing Employees, effective as of January 1, 2017; (ii) that Continuing
Employees who elected to participate in Seller's health or dependent care
flexible spending accounts during 2017 under Seller's existing cafeteria plan
("Cafeteria Plan") shall become participants in Buyer's health flexible
spending account plan and/or Flexible Benefit Plan, as appropriate, as of
January 1, 2017 at the level of coverage provided in Seller's Cafeteria Plan,
and (iii) for reimbursement of health care and/or dependent care expenses, as
appropriate, incurred by Continuing Employees at any time during 2017, up to
the amount of the Continuing Employees' 2017 salary reduction election,
reduced by amounts reimbursed prior to Closing by the Cafeteria Plan. Seller
or the Company, as applicable, shall take all actions necessary to provide
that no health care or dependent care claims will be processed by Seller's
Cafeteria Plan during the ten (10) day period immediately prior to the Closing
Date, and five (5) days prior to Closing Seller shall reconcile underspent and

at the end of the 2017 plan year shall be assets of Buyer.

(c)Seller and the Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, take such
corporate action as necessary to cause the Seller 401(k) Plan to be amended

permitted under the Seller 401(k) Plan, such Continuing Employees may maintain
their vested accounts under the Seller 401(k) Plan, make plan loan repayments
thereunder, direct the investment of their accounts and maintain such other
rights and privileges as are available thereunder), subject to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and provided
that, prior to the Closing Date and subject to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer shall take, or cause to be
taken, all corporate action as is necessary, including amendments to the Buyer
401(k) Plan, to permit the Continuing Employees to be eligible to make salary
deferral contributions and otherwise participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan as
soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and to roll any eligible
rollover distributions of pre-tax contributions (but excluding loans) over
into a 401(k) plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (the "Buyer
401(k) Plan") following the Closing Date. Seller shall continue to sponsor the
Seller 401(k) Plan after Closing, and there shall be no transfer of assets or
liabilities from Seller 401(k) Plan to Buyer 401(k) Plan, except for elective
rollovers by individuals of eligible rollover distributions.

(d)Seller and the Company shall, prior to the Closing Date, take such
corporate action as necessary to cause Seller and the Company to vest all
benefits for Employees who 

participate in Seller's non-qualified deferred compensation plan (as set forth
on Section 5.21(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule) ("Non-Qualified Plan")
and to cause the Non-Qualified Plan to be amended such that the Company shall
no longer be a participating employer, and the participating Employees will no
longer be eligible to participate in the Non-Qualified Plan as of the Closing
Date, subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. After the Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to provide
that the benefits owed to each Employee who participates in the Non-Qualified
Plan be paid to such Employees from the Rabbi Trust pursuant to the terms set
forth in the Non-Qualified Plan and the Rabbi Trust shall be terminated once
all payments are made to the participating Employees.

(e)As soon as administratively practicable following the Closing, the Company
shall pay out to each Continuing Employee all accrued but unused vacation or
other paid time off accrued by the Continuing Employee from calendar years
ended prior to the Closing Date that cannot be used by the Employee under
Seller\'s policies with respect to vacation and other paid time off during the
calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs. In addition, each Continuing
Employee shall be eligible to use his or her Permitted Rollover PTO following
the Closing in accordance with Buyer's policies relating to vacation and other
paid time off; provided that each Continuing Employee who has not used all of
his or her Permitted Rollover PTO as of December 31, 2017 shall be permitted
to roll over the portion of the Permitted Rollover PTO that is unused as of
December 31, 2017 and be eligible to use such vacation or other paid time off
in calendar year 2018 in accordance with Buyer's policies relating to vacation
and other paid time off. For the avoidance of doubt, the Continuing Employee
shall not be permitted to roll over any of his or her Permitted Rollover PTO
that is unused as of December 31, 2018 and shall receive no consideration with
respect to such unused Permitted Rollover PTO.

(f)Without limiting the generality of this Section 7.7, nothing contained in
this Section 7.7, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
individual (including Employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries of
Employees or retirees) any right as a third-party beneficiary of this
Agreement and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any Plan or
other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate any of the parties or any of their respective Affiliates to (i)
maintain any particular Plan, or (ii) retain the employment or services or any
Employee, Consultant, or other service provider, or any other Person.

Section 7.8 Affiliate Arrangements. Except for the activities contemplated and
intended to be continued following the Closing through either the IVF Media
Supply Agreement or the Transition Services Agreement, on or prior to the
Closing, the Company shall terminate all Affiliate Arrangements in a manner
and on such terms that shall not subject the Company, Buyer or their
respective Affiliates to any ongoing obligations or require the Company to
make any termination or indemnity or other payments on or after the Closing
Date.

Section 7.9 Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and to applicable Law,
each of the parties shall cooperate and use its respective reasonable best

cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the 

other parties in doing, such things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby, including

party with any information which may be required in order to effectuate such
filings and (b) respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiry received
from FTC, DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority for additional information
or documentation. Each of Buyer and Seller shall (i) promptly notify the other
party of any material communication between that party and FTC, DOJ, or any
other Governmental Authority and, subject to applicable Law, discuss with and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written communication
to any of the foregoing; (ii) consult with the other party in advance of

concerning valuation or future plans for the Business, (y) as necessary to
comply with contractual obligations of confidentiality and (z) as necessary to

Section 7.10 Non-Competition and Employee Non-Solicit.

(a)For a period of five (5) years in the U.S. and the rest of the world (other
than the European Union), and a period of three (3) years in the European
Union, from and after the Closing Date anywhere in the world (the
"Territory"), neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or
indirectly, engage in, own, have any financial interest in, manage or operate
anywhere in the Territory, a business the same as, substantially similar to,
or which materially competes with, the Business by providing contract
manufacturing and development services with respect to the formulation,
manufacture, fill/finish and packaging of drug substances and drug products;
provided, however, that the beneficial ownership (within the meaning of
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of less than two percent
(2%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of a publicly held corporation
that is engaged in the Business within the Territory shall be permitted.

(b)Notwithstanding anything in Section 7.10(a) to the contrary, Buyer and
Seller agree that (i) the provisions of Section 7.10(a) shall not apply to the
formulation, manufacture, fill/finish, packaging, marketing, distribution or
sale of in vitro fertilization media and (ii) Seller and its Affiliates shall
be permitted to engage in (A) any business (other than the Business) that
Seller or its Affiliates were engaged in as of the date hereof, and (B) IVF

conditioned media and veterinary products.

(c)Commencing on the date hereof and continuing for a period of three (3)
years from and after the Closing Date anywhere in the Territory, neither
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, solicit for
employment or employ any then-current Employee involved in the Business of the
Company or request, induce or advise any then-current Employee thereof to
leave the employ of the Company, without the prior written consent of Buyer;
provided that a general offer of employment to the public, with respect to any
non-competing business, shall not be deemed prohibited hereunder as long as
not specifically directed at any then-current Employee of the 

Company. Commencing on the date hereof and continuing for a period of three
(3) years from and after the Closing Date anywhere in the Territory, neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, solicit for

Seller or request, induce or advise any current employee, officer, director or
manager thereof to leave the employ of Seller, without the prior written

officer, director or manager of Seller.

(d)The nature and scope of the foregoing protection has been carefully
considered by Buyer and Seller. Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
covenants contained in this Section 7.10 are essential elements of this
Agreement and that but for these covenants, Buyer would not have agreed to
acquire the Company Interests or otherwise become party to this Agreement.
Buyer and Seller hereby agree and acknowledge that the duration, scope and
geographic areas applicable to such provisions are fair, reasonable and
necessary and that adequate compensation has been received by Seller for such
obligations. If, however, for any reason any court determines that any such
restrictions are not reasonable or that consideration is inadequate, such
restrictions shall be interpreted, modified or rewritten to include as much of
the duration, scope and geographic area identified in this Section 7.10 as
will render such restrictions valid and enforceable, and the other provisions
hereof shall remain in full force and effect.

(e)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event of a breach
or threatened breach of this Section 7.10, Buyer shall be entitled, without
the posting of a bond or other security, to seek an injunction restraining
such breach or threatened breach. The foregoing shall not be construed as
prohibiting any party from pursuing any other remedy available to it for such
breach or threatened breach.

Section 7.11 No Solicitation.

(a)The Exclusivity Agreement is terminated as of the date hereof and is of no
further force and effect.

(b)Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, neither the Company, Seller,
or any of its or their respective Affiliates, shall directly or indirectly
(including by way of providing information regarding the Company or the
Business to any Person or providing access to any Person), (i) solicit any
offer, proposal or inquiry (oral, written or electronic), or encourage or
facilitate the solicitation of any offer, proposal or inquiry (oral, written
or electronic) relating to any potential Competing Transaction, (ii)
participate in, continue or engage in any discussion or negotiation relating
to, furnish any information concerning the Company, or the Business or
properties of the Company, with respect to, afford access to its properties,
Business Records in connection with, or facilitate in any other manner any
effort or attempt by any Person other than Buyer to make or seek, any
potential Competing Transaction, or (iii) enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding (oral, written or electronic) relating to any
potential Competing Transaction. Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if any
such offer or inquiry is received by, any such information is requested from,
or any such negotiation or discussion is sought to be initiated or continued
with, the Company, Seller or any of their respective Representatives,
including the nature and terms of 

any of the foregoing, the identity of the parties involved and any
modification to the nature or terms relating to any potential Competing
Transaction. Seller shall, and shall cause the Company and its Affiliates to
advise their applicable officers, directors, shareholders and senior Employees
of the existence of the foregoing covenants, and Seller shall, and shall cause
the Company and its Affiliates to respond to any inquiry received by their
Representatives regarding any Competing Transaction by stating that the
Company, Seller and its and their Affiliates are subject to the foregoing
covenants.

Section 7.12 Termination of Guarantees of Indebtedness. At or prior to the
Closing, the Company shall, and Seller shall cause the Company to, terminate
any and all Guarantees of Indebtedness (and any and all Liens or security
interests on assets of the Company relating thereto), including pursuant to
the Guarantee Agreement, so that on and after the Closing, the Company shall
not have any obligation with respect to any such Guarantees of Indebtedness
(to include, without limitation, any Guarantees of Indebtedness on behalf of
Seller).

Section 7.13 Cooperation; Financial Information.

(a)Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange the Financing, maintain the Debt Commitment Letter in full
force and effect, and obtain the financing contemplated thereby as promptly as
reasonably practicable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply
with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter, (ii) as promptly as
practicable (taking into account the Marketing Period), negotiate, execute,
and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions contemplated
thereby, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the Marketing
Period) all conditions to funding that are applicable to Buyer in the Debt
Commitment Letter and (iv) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and Section 8.4, and the completion of the
Marketing Period, consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing Date. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or it becomes reasonably likely that it
would become so unavailable, Buyer shall as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, notify Seller thereof in writing and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain (x) alternative financing from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement that does not contain any condition to funding that would be
more onerous than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter, as
applicable, on the date hereof or any terms that would reasonably be expected
to delay or impede the consummation of the debt financing thereunder beyond
the date set forth in Section 10.1(d) (taking into account the Marketing
Period) and that is on terms no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Buyer
than the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement (the
"Alternate Financing"), and (y) one or more new financing commitment letters
with respect to such Alternate Financing (each, a "New Commitment Letter"), in
each case, which New Commitment Letter(s) will replace the existing Debt
Commitment Letter in whole or in part. Buyer shall promptly provide the
Company with a true, correct, and complete copy of any New Commitment Letter,
together with any related exhibits, schedules, supplements, and term sheets,
and a true, correct, and complete copy of any fee letter in connection
therewith (it being understood that such letter will be redacted in a
customary manner and none of the redacted provisions would adversely affect
the 

availability of the Alternate Financing or allow the financing sources thereof
to reduce the amount of funding to be provided under the New Commitment Letter
or the definitive documentation of the credit facilities provided thereunder
or the conditions on which such funding is available). In the event that any
New Commitment Letter is obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Financing" or the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall mean the Debt Commitment
Letter to the extent not superseded at the time in question, and any New
Commitment Letter (and/or any related fee letter(s)) to the extent then in
effect, and (B) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing" will mean
the Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as modified pursuant
to the foregoing.

(b)Buyer will not consent to any amendment, restatement, replacement,
supplement, termination, assignment, or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision (including any condition) or remedy under, the Debt
Commitment Letter without the prior written consent of Seller, to the extent
such amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement, termination, assignment,
modification, or waiver would individually or in the aggregate reasonably be
expected to (i) materially delay or prevent the Closing, (ii) make the funding
of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing) in each case necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby less likely in any material respect to occur at or prior to the
Closing, or (iii) adversely impact the ability of Buyer to in any material
respect timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that Buyer may (A) amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders,
lead arrangers, bookrunners, agents, syndication agents, documentation agents,
or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the
date of this Agreement in accordance with the provisions hereof and of the
Debt Commitment Letter, (B) amend or otherwise modify the Debt Commitment
Letter to implement any flex provisions applicable thereto, or (C) otherwise
amend, modify or replace, or agree to any waivers in respect of, the Debt
Commitment Letter so long as, with respect to replacements, the replacement
debt commitments otherwise satisfy the terms and conditions of an Alternate
Financing, or such amended, modified, replaced or waived terms would not, or
would not reasonably be expected to, materially adversely impact or materially
delay the ability of Buyer to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby when required.

(c)Each of Seller and the Company shall, and Seller shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, provide such
cooperation and assistance to Buyer in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, including the following
actions:

(i)participating in a reasonable number of meetings with (including to

sessions, and cooperating reasonably with the marketing efforts of Buyer and
the Financing Sources, in connection with all or any portion of the Financing;

documents required in connection with any of the Financing, including to cause
the execution and delivery of reasonable and customary representation letters
in connection with the bank information memoranda;

(iii)furnishing to Buyer and the Financing Sources as promptly as reasonably
practical and, in all cases, in a timely manner, (A) (1) the Most Recent
Audited Financial Statements and audited consolidated balance sheets and the
related audited statements of income, shareholder's equity and cash flows of
the Company for each subsequent fiscal year ended at least ninety (90)
calendar days before the Closing Date, (2) the Most Recent Unaudited Financial
Statements and unaudited consolidated balance sheets and related statements of
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of the Company for each subsequent
fiscal quarter (other than the fourth (4th) fiscal quarter of the Company's
fiscal year) ended at least forty-five (45) calendar days prior to the Closing
Date (including the comparable prior year period) and (3) such other financial
and operating information and data relating to the Company of the type
customarily included in, or required to be included in, a registered public
offering of securities by Buyer on Form S-1 (including information necessary
for Buyer's preparation of customary pro forma financial statements to be
included therein), and of the type, form and substance necessary for an
investment bank to receive customary comfort (including "negative assurance"
comfort) (including information required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K
under the Securities Act), including drafts of customary "comfort letters"
(including customary "negative assurances") for a private placement
transaction from the Company's independent auditors, reasonably requested by
Buyer and the Financing Sources in connection with the arrangement, marketing,
syndication of the financing contemplated by the Financing and (B) such other
financial or pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably
available to the Company, and which is (1) reasonably requested by Buyer in
connection with the preparation of a confidential information memorandum and
offering documents customary for the type of financing contemplated by the

diligence;

(v)using reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are reasonably

Letter) and the taking of corporate actions by the Company with respect to
entering into definitive documentation with respect to the Financing; provided
that any such corporate actions shall be contingent upon and effective as of
the Closing;

(vi)to the extent required in connection with the Financing, requesting the
Company's independent auditor to provide reasonable assistance to Buyer

extent applicable, any other audited financial statements delivered pursuant
to this Section 7.13, on customary terms in connection with the Financing,
participating in due diligence sessions with the Financing Sources and
requesting the provision to the Financing Sources of customary "comfort"
letters from such auditor prior to the Closing Date, which shall provide
customary "negative assurance" comfort);

(vii)executing and delivering, at and effective as of the Closing, such
definitive financing documents and other customary closing documents, as may
be reasonably requested by Buyer and are required in connection with the
Financing;

(viii)cooperating reasonably in connection with the termination of existing

(d)Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 7.13(c), (i) the Company shall
not be required to enter into or approve (or commit to enter into or approve)
any certificate, document, agreement, instrument, or financing agreement, in
each case, which will be effective prior to the Closing Date (other than
customary representation letters, authorization letters and confirmations
(including with respect to the absence of the presence of material non-public
information), subject to customary exclusions), (ii) the Company shall not be
required to pay or commit to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any
other Liability (including any guarantee, indemnity, or pledge) in connection
with the Financing prior to the Closing Date, except that the Company shall be
required to pay any and all fees, costs, and expenses in connection with
obtaining any required approvals under the Guarantees of Indebtedness
permitting the termination thereof on the Closing Date and the release of all
Liens on properties and assets of the Company securing such obligations, if
any, and (iii) nothing herein will require the Company or any of its
Representatives to provide any information or take any action, the disclosure

that the Company shall give notice to Buyer of the fact that it is withholding
such information or documents on the basis of any such Law, duty, Contract,
obligation or privilege, shall withhold only that portion of such information
that is reasonably necessary to be withheld to not violate applicable Law,
duty, Contract, or obligation and to preserve attorney-client privilege, and

(e)Buyer will, upon request by Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys'

connection with the Financing, including in connection with the cooperation of

condition to Closing.

(g)The Company shall give Buyer notice if it becomes aware that the Required
Information taken as a whole is or becomes incorrect in any material respect.

Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that does not
harm or disparage the Company or any of its Affiliates or their reputation or
goodwill. All non-public information regarding the Company and its Affiliates
provided to any of Buyer, the Financing Sources or their respective
Representatives pursuant to this Section 7.13 shall be kept confidential in
accordance with Section 7.4(b), except for disclosure to potential lenders and
investors and their respective Representatives that is reasonably required in
connection with the Financing or that is otherwise required to be disclosed by

increase the representations and warranties set forth herein. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Company (i) shall not, without the
written approval of Buyer, voluntarily encumber any of the Real Property with
any Liens, easements, restrictions or covenants, in each case, that are not
Permitted Liens, and (ii) shall, at Closing, remove any mechanics' liens or

comparable role with, the Company (but not in the capacity of any role of such
Persons with Seller), for a Claims reporting or discovery period of not less
than six (6) years from and after the Closing with respect to any Claim
related to any period prior to the Closing from any insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as Seller's current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are substantially comparable with, in all material respects, or
more favorable to the insureds than the coverage provided under Seller's
existing policies. 

Section 7.16 Use of Seller Retained Names.

(a)On and after the date that is seventy-five (75) days following the Closing
Date, except as expressly provided in this Section 7.16 or any Ancillary

otherwise discontinue use of the Retained Names; provided, however, that
during such one hundred thirty-five (135) day period (the "Transition
Period"), Buyer or its Affiliates may continue to distribute product
literature that uses any Retained Names and distribute products with labeling
or packaging that uses any Retained Names to the extent that such product
literature and labeling or packaging exists on the Closing Date. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall only use the Retained Names after the Closing in a manner
consistent with the use of such Retained Names by the Company prior to the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Products and Services
of the Company, Buyer, or any third party acting on Buyer's behalf, may
continue to sell such Products and Services, notwithstanding that it or its
labeling or packaging bears one or more of the Retained Names, during the
Transition Period.

(c)Effective as of the Closing Date, Seller hereby grants to Buyer during the
Transition Period a worldwide, royalty-free, non-transferable, exclusive
license to use the following Internet domain names incorporating the Retained
Names: cookpharmica.com (the "Seller Domain") as a URL in connection with the
continued operation of the Internet and Intranet websites operated under that
URL prior to the Closing Date. Seller shall maintain the registrations for the
Seller Domain in full force and effect for the duration of the Transition
Period at Seller's sole cost and expense, unless directed otherwise by Buyer.

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.16 to the contrary, Buyer and
its Affiliates may at all times after the Closing Date (i) retain and use, for
their internal business purposes, records and other historical or archived
documents containing or referencing the Retained Names; (ii) use the Retained
Names to the extent required by or permitted as a fair use or otherwise under
applicable Law, including for filing with a Governmental Authority or uses
that would not cause confusion as to the origin or sponsorship of a good or
service; and (iii) refer on their websites and in their advertising, marketing
and promotional materials to the historical fact that the Company previously
conducted the Business under the Retained Names, as applicable.

Section 7.17 280G Shareholder Vote. To the extent any individual may receive
any payment or benefit that individually or in the aggregate would be a
"parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Parachute Payment"), the
Parachute Payment shall be contingent upon a vote of the stockholders of the
Company in the manner provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and its
associated Treasury Regulations. To the extent that a Parachute Payment under
Section 280G of the Code is not approved by the stockholders of the Company as
contemplated above prior to the Closing, the 

payment shall not be made or provided in any manner. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer evidence that a vote of the stockholders of the
Company was solicited in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
Section 7.17 and that either (a) the requisite number of votes was obtained
with respect to the Parachute Payment and payment shall be made, or (b) the
approval was not obtained in whole or in part, and, as a consequence, to the
extent the Parachute Payment was not approved, it shall not be made or
provided.

Section 7.18 Discretionary Bonuses. Promptly following the Closing, Seller
shall fund, or cause to be funded, the discretionary bonuses granted by it to
the Continuing Employees in accordance with Section 7.1(b)(xviii), including
the employer portion of any payroll, employment or similar taxes payable in
connection therewith, and shall pay or cause to be paid such discretionary
bonuses through the transitional payroll services provided to the Company
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

Survival; Indemnification

Section 9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All of the
representations and warranties of the parties set forth in this Agreement
shall terminate and expire, and shall cease to be of any force or effect on
the date following the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date,
and all Liability with respect to breaches of such representations and
warranties shall thereupon be extinguished (except to the extent a Claim with
respect thereto has been made prior to such time in which case such
representations and warranties shall survive until such Claim is resolved).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties of Seller
set forth in (a) Section 5.20 (Employee and Labor Matters) and Section 5.21
(Employee Benefits), shall survive, and all Liability with respect to breaches
of such representations and warranties, shall continue in full force and
effect until the date following the three-year (3) anniversary of the Closing
Date, (b) Section 5.22 (Tax Matters), and all Liability with respect to
breaches of such representations and warranties, shall continue in full force
and effect until the date following ninety (90) days after all applicable
statutes of limitations, including waivers and extensions, have expired with
respect to the matters addressed therein and (c) the Fundamental
Representations, and all Liability with respect to breaches of such
representations and warranties, shall survive for a period of five (5) years,
in each case, except to the extent a Claim with respect thereto has been made
prior to such time in which case such representations and warranties shall
survive solely with respect to such Claim until such Claim is resolved.
Notwithstanding anything in this Article IX to the contrary, in the event that
any breach or alleged breach of any representation or warranty by (i) the
Company or Seller results from fraud or Willful Breach of the Company or
Seller, or (ii) Buyer results from fraud or Willful Breach of Buyer, then, in
each case, such representation or warranty shall survive the Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue in
full force and effect without any time limitation with respect to such breach
or alleged breach.

Section 9.2 Indemnification by Seller. From and after the Closing, Seller
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer, its Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, representatives,
successors and assigns (collectively, "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against
any and all Losses incurred by any of Buyer Indemnitees arising out of, in
connection with or relating to any: (a) inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller in Section 5.21 (Employee Benefits),
(b) Company Transaction Expenses to the extent not taken into account in
reducing the Closing Consideration Amount, (c) Indebtedness to the extent not
taken into account in reducing the Closing Consideration Amount and (d) Seller
Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not have any obligation to
indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Buyer Indemnitee for Losses arising out
of, in connection with or relating to any inaccuracy in or breach of any other
representation or warranty not expressly set forth in clause (a) of this
Section 9.2 or in the definition of Seller Taxes, regardless of the survival
or non-survival thereof. 

Section 9.3 Limitations on Indemnification Obligations.

(a)Seller shall not be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees with respect to
any Claim for indemnification arising out of, in connection with or relating
to matters described in Section 9.2 unless and until the aggregate amount of
all such Claims for such matters exceeds one-half percent (0.5%) of the
Purchase Price, in which event Buyer Indemnitees will be entitled to recover
all Losses in excess of such amount arising out of, in connection with or
relating to such matters.

(b)The aggregate amount required to be paid by Seller pursuant to Section 9.2
shall not exceed in the aggregate ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price.

(c)For the purposes of determining any inaccuracy in or breach of, or the
amount of any Losses related to the inaccuracy in or breach of, any of the
representations or warranties as set forth in this Agreement, the
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement shall be considered
without regard to any qualifications as to "material", "materiality" or
"Company Material Adverse Effect" (or any correlative terms) set forth
therein.

Section 9.4 Procedure with Respect to Direct Claims.

(a)If a Buyer Indemnitee shall have a Claim for indemnification hereunder
other than with respect to a Claim asserted by a third party, Buyer Indemnitee
shall, as promptly as is practicable, give written notice to the party from
whom indemnification is sought (i.e., Seller) (the "Indemnitor") of the nature
and, to the extent practicable, a good faith estimate of the amount, of the
Claim. The failure to make timely delivery of such written notice by Buyer
Indemnitee to the Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any
Liability under this Article IX with respect to such Claim, except to the
extent the Indemnitor is actually materially prejudiced.

(b)Within thirty (30) days after receipt of a claim notice, the Indemnitor
shall, by written notice to Buyer Indemnitee, either concede or deny Liability
for the Claim set forth in the claim notice. If the Indemnitor shall deny
Liability, in whole or in part, such written notice to Buyer Indemnitee shall
be accompanied by a reasonably detailed description of the basis for denial.
If the Indemnitor fails to deliver such written notice to Buyer Indemnitee by
5:00 P.M. (Eastern Time) on the last day of the thirty (30) day period, the
Indemnitor shall be deemed to have conceded the entire amount of the Claim
and, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer Indemnitee shall
be entitled to the entire amount of the Claim. If the Indemnitor denies
Liability for such Claim, in whole or in part, within thirty (30) days of
receipt by the Indemnitor of a claim notice, representatives of senior
management of the Indemnitor and Buyer Indemnitee with decision-making
authority with respect to the issues set forth in the claim notice shall meet
to discuss and attempt to resolve the matter prior to taking any formal action
with respect thereto. If Buyer and Seller fail to resolve the dispute within
thirty (30) days after Buyer Indemnitee received a written notice from the
Indemnitor denying the Claim, any party may commence appropriate legal
proceedings in order to obtain a final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. 

Section 9.5 Procedure with Respect to Third Party Claims.

(a)If a Buyer Indemnitee receives notice of any matter involving a Claim
asserted by a third party that would give rise to an indemnification Claim
against the Indemnitor, then Buyer Indemnitee shall, as promptly as is
practicable, deliver to the Indemnitor a written notice describing, to the
extent practicable, such matter in reasonable detail. The failure to make
timely delivery of such written notice by Buyer Indemnitee to the Indemnitor
shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any Liability under this Article IX with
respect to such matter, except to the extent the Indemnitor is actually
materially prejudiced.

(b)The Indemnitor shall have the right, at its option, to assume the defense
of any such matter with its own counsel, but only if the Indemnitor
simultaneously agrees to fully indemnify Buyer Indemnitee for such matter.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article IX, the
Indemnitor shall not have the option to assume the defense of any such third
party Claim (i) which seeks any remedy other than monetary damages, (ii) which
seeks monetary damages in an amount that exceeds the portion of the Subsequent
Payment Amount then remaining to be paid to Seller (less all then pending and
unpaid indemnification Claims) (iii) which Claim, or the assumption by the
Indemnitor of the defense of which Claim, Buyer Indemnitee reasonably
determines (A) could adversely affect the continuing business operations of
Buyer Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or their relationships with
customers, clients, suppliers or other third parties with whom Buyer
Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates has a material business relationship, (B)
would reasonably pose significant legal, financial, regulatory or reputational
risk or exposure to Buyer Indemnitee or (C) is a Claim involving a criminal
matter or Litigation in which the third party is a Governmental Authority (in
which case Buyer Indemnitee shall have the right to control the defense of
such matter and the Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in the
defense of such matter at the Indemnitor's own cost and expense) or (iv) which
claim is covered by the RandW Insurance Policy and the Losses arising from or
relating to such Claim are in excess (or are reasonably likely to be in
excess) of the retention under such RandW Insurance Policy.

(c)If the Indemnitor is able to and elects to assume the defense of any such
matter, then:

(i)Buyer Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense of such
matter and to employ its own counsel, at its own cost and expense, and the
Indemnitor shall not be required to pay or otherwise indemnify Buyer
Indemnitee against any attorneys' fees or other expenses incurred on behalf of
Buyer Indemnitee in connection with such matter following the Indemnitor's
election to assume the defense of such matter, unless (A) the Indemnitor fails
to defend diligently any Claim or Litigation within ten (10) days after
receiving notice of such failure from Buyer Indemnitee, (B) Buyer Indemnitee
reasonably shall have concluded (following consultation with its counsel) that
there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to such Buyer
Indemnitee or other Buyer Indemnitees that are not available to the
Indemnitor, or (C) Buyer Indemnitee reasonably shall have concluded (following
consultation with its counsel) that, with respect to such Claims, Buyer
Indemnitee and the Indemnitor may have different, conflicting, or adverse
legal positions or interests. 

(ii)The Indemnitor shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer
Indemnitee, settle or compromise any pending or threatened Litigation in
respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not Buyer
Indemnitee is an actual or potential party to such Litigation) or consent to
the entry of any judgment (A) which does not, to the extent that Buyer
Indemnitee may have any Liability with respect to such Litigation, include as
an unconditional term thereof the delivery by the claimant or plaintiff to
Buyer Indemnitee of a written release of Buyer Indemnitee from all Liability
in respect of such Litigation, (B) which includes any statement or admission
of fact regarding culpability of, or a failure to act by or on behalf of,
Buyer Indemnitee, or (C) in any manner that involves any injunctive or non-
monetary relief against Buyer Indemnitee.

(d)If the Indemnitor is unable to or elects not to assume the defense of such
matter, or fails to notify Buyer Indemnitee of its election to assume the
defense of such matter, within thirty (30) days after receipt of written
notice of such matter, then Buyer Indemnitee shall proceed to defend such
matter and shall be entitled to be reimbursed on an ongoing basis by the
Indemnitor for all reasonable costs, expenses and fees incurred by Buyer
Indemnitee in the defense of such matter (including attorneys' fees and
expenses).

(e)Regardless of which party assumes the defense of such matter, the parties
shall cooperate with one another in connection therewith. Such cooperation
shall include making available all non-privileged Business Records and other
documents and materials that are relevant to the defense of such matter and
making employees, officers and advisors available to provide additional
information or to act as a witness or respond to legal process.

Section 9.6 Tax Matters. The parties shall treat any indemnity payment made
pursuant to this Article IX as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax
purposes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Article IX, all procedures relating
to Tax Contests shall be governed exclusively by the provisions of Section
7.2(f).

Section 9.7 Calculation of Losses.

(a)The amount of any Losses payable under this Article IX by the Indemnitor
shall be net of any amount actually recovered by Buyer Indemnitee under
applicable insurance policies (net of any premium increase or other out-of-
pocket expense, including co-payments, incurred by such Buyer Indemnitee in
collecting such amount). If Buyer Indemnitee receives any amount under any
applicable insurance policy subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnitor, then such Buyer Indemnitee shall reimburse the Indemnitor for any
payment made or expense incurred by such Indemnitor in connection with
providing such indemnification payment (net of any premium increase or other
out-of-pocket expense, including co-payments, incurred by such Buyer
Indemnitee in collecting such amount). Buyer Indemnitees shall use reasonable
best efforts to mitigate Losses (other than Losses incurred by any Buyer
Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with or relating to any Seller Taxes)
upon and after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any such Losses that are indemnifiable hereunder. 

(b)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Indemnitor shall not
be liable under this Article IX for any Losses relating to any matter to the
extent that (A) Buyer Indemnitee shall have otherwise been fully reimbursed
for such matter pursuant to, or the Loss was fully taken into account under,
any other provision of this Agreement, so as to avoid duplication or "double
counting" of the same Loss; or (B) without limiting the generality of clause
(A), such matter was taken into account by amounts paid pursuant to Section
3.3 after the final determination of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement.

Section 9.8 RandW Insurance Policy. Each party and its Representatives shall
reasonably cooperate with the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy in
connection with the defense of any matter which might reasonably constitute a
Loss (as defined under the RandW Insurance Policy). The insurer under the RandW
Insurance Policy shall have the right to participate in the investigation,
defense and settlement of any Third Party Claim (as defined in the RandW
Insurance Policy) or other matter reasonably likely to be covered under the
RandW Insurance Policy.

ARTCILE X.

Termination

Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned:

(a)at any time, by mutual written agreement of Buyer and Seller;

(b)by Buyer, at any time prior to the Closing, if (i) the Company or Seller is
in breach, in any material respect, of the representations, warranties or
covenants made by it in this Agreement, (ii) such breach is not cured within
ten (10) Business Days of written notice of such breach from Buyer (to the
extent such breach is curable) and (iii) such breach, if not cured, would
render the conditions set forth in Section 8.4 incapable of being satisfied;
provided, however, that Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(b) if there has been a violation or
breach of this Agreement by Buyer that has prevented or would prevent

(c)by Seller, at any time prior to the Closing, if (i) Buyer is in breach, in
any material respect, of the representations, warranties or covenants made by
it in this Agreement, (ii) such breach is not cured within ten (10) Business
Days of written notice of such breach from Seller (to the extent such breach

Seller shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(c) if there has been a violation or breach of this Agreement by
the Company or Seller that has prevented or would prevent satisfaction of any
conditions set forth in Section 8.4;

(d)by Buyer or Seller, at any time after March 18, 2018 (the "End Date") if
the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to such date; provided that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(d) shall not be
available to such party if the action or inaction of such party or any of its
Affiliates has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the 

Closing to occur on or before such date and such action or failure to act
constitutes a breach of this Agreement;

(e)by Buyer or Seller if any Governmental Authority shall have enacted,
issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any Law or Order, or refused to grant
any required consent or approval, that has the effect of making the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or
that otherwise prohibits the consummation of transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and such Law, Order or other action shall have become final and non-
appealable; or

(f)by Seller if (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all the conditions set
forth in Section 8.3 and Section 8.4 have been, and continue to be, satisfied
or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing, each of which shall be capable of being satisfied if the
Closing Date were the date that notice of termination is delivered by Seller
to Buyer), (ii) Buyer does not consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement on or prior to the day the Closing is required to occur
pursuant to Section 2.1, (iii) Seller shall have irrevocably confirmed in
writing to Buyer that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the date of such confirmation
and throughout the five (5) Business Day period following delivery of such
confirmation and (iv) Buyer fails to effect the Closing by the earlier to
occur of (x) five (5) Business Days following the date on which the Closing
shall have occurred pursuant to Section 2.1 or (y) the End Date.

Section 10.2 Procedure Upon Termination. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement and the abandonment of the transactions contemplated hereby,
written notice thereof shall be given by a terminating party to the other
parties, and this Agreement shall terminate and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be abandoned without further action by any of the parties.

Section 10.3 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to Section 10.1, then:

(a)Buyer on the one hand, and Seller on the other hand, shall promptly cause
to be returned to Seller or Buyer, as applicable, or cause the destruction of,
all documents and information, including Confidential Information, in whatever
format, obtained in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and all documents and information, in whatever format,
obtained by either party in connection with Buyer's investigation of the
Company, including any copies made by or supplied to Buyer, Seller or any of
their respective Representatives of any such documents or information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, one copy of such documents or information may
be retained by each of Buyer and Seller's external legal counsel for
evidentiary purposes in the case of any legal proceedings or threatened legal
proceedings relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby; and each of Buyer and Seller need not delete from its electronic
archival systems any information archived in an integrated fashion with other,
unrelated information of Buyer or Seller, as applicable, as long as Buyer and
Seller make no effort to retrieve such archived information.

(b)No party shall have any duties or obligations to the other parties hereto
after the date of such termination and none of the parties will have any
further liability hereunder; 

provided, however, (i) except as provided in Section 10.5, no such termination
shall relieve any party from Liability for any fraud or Willful Breach by that
party, and (ii) Section 7.5, this Section 10.3, Section 10.4, Section 10.5 and
Article XI shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination
of this Agreement (together with any corresponding defined terms) in
accordance with their respective terms. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Willful Breach" means a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or
other agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a consequence of an act or
failure to act by the breaching party with the actual knowledge that the
taking of such act or failure to take such act would, or would reasonably be
expected to, be inconsistent with or contrary to the terms of this Agreement.

Section 10.4 Termination Fee.

(a)In the event (i) Seller terminates this Agreement as provided in Section
10.1(c) or Section 10.1(f), or (ii) Buyer or Seller terminates this Agreement
as provided in Section 10.1(d) or Section 10.1(e) (other than due to the
failure to receive clearance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents under the Competition Laws of the United
States or Germany or because a Governmental Authority has enacted, issued,
promulgated, enforced or entered a legal proceeding or Order pursuant to its
Competition Laws that is in effect and which prevents or prohibits the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), Buyer shall, no later
than five (5) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay or cause
to be paid to Seller an amount equal to thirty-five million dollars
($35,000,000) (the "Termination Fee"), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account or accounts designated in advance by Seller.

(b)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree that in
no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

Section 10.5 Exclusive Remedy.

(a)From and after the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the sole and
exclusive remedy of each party in the event of a breach (including any Willful
Breach) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in
this Agreement by another party will be (i) termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 10.1 and pursuit of the post-termination remedies
permitted under Section 10.3 or Section 10.4 as applicable, or (ii) specific
performance in accordance with Section 11.11. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to Section
10.1(c) or Section 10.1(f) (or pursuant to any other provision of Section 10.1
under circumstances in which it was entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.1(c) or Section 10.1(f)), the right of Seller to
receive the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 10.4 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy against Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives for any Losses suffered by Seller, the Company and any of
their respective Affiliates or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no other amount shall be due
and payable by Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives as a
result thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, while Seller may seek specific
performance in accordance with Section 11.11 and payment of the Termination
Fee pursuant to Section 10.4, in no circumstance shall Seller be permitted or
entitled to receive (A) payment of monetary damages prior to the termination
of this Agreement or in amounts 

in excess of the Termination Fee, (B) payment of both monetary damages and the
Termination Fee or (C) both a grant of specific performance to cause the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and payment of
the Termination Fee or any monetary damages. In no event shall Seller be
entitled to seek the remedy of specific performance of this Agreement against
any Financing Sources in its or their capacity as a lender, purchaser,
underwriter or arranger in connection with the Financing.

(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in connection
with any Loss suffered as a result of any breach (including any Willful
Breach) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Financing, or in respect
of any oral representation made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith, in each case, other than in a circumstance in which Seller is
permitted to terminate this Agreement and receive the Termination Fee pursuant
to Section 10.4, Seller agrees that the maximum aggregate Liability of Buyer
shall be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Termination Fee, and
in no event shall Seller, the Company or their Affiliates seek to recover any
monetary damages in excess of such amount in the aggregate. In no event shall
Seller or the Company seek to recover monetary damages from any Person
(including the Financing Sources) other than Buyer in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties acknowledge that the
agreements contained in Section 10.3 and Section 10.4 and this Section 10.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement.

(c)From and after the Closing, the right to indemnification under Article IX,
subject to all of the terms, conditions and limitations thereof, shall
constitute the sole and exclusive right and remedy available to Buyer against
Seller or any of its Affiliates for any breach of this Agreement, and Buyer
shall not initiate or maintain any lawsuit or other legal proceeding at law or
in equity against Seller which is directly or indirectly related to any breach
of this Agreement, except that Buyer may pursue legal or equitable relief
against Seller for any claim for fraud. Nothing in this Section 10.5(c) shall
preclude Buyer from seeking specific performance, injunctive or similar
equitable relief as provided in Section 11.11. For the avoidance of doubt, any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of Seller set forth
in this Agreement shall not, of itself, constitute fraud by Seller.

ARTICLE XI.

giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the Law of 

any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware, including all matters of
construction, validity and performance; provided that all claims or causes of
action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
any of the Financing Sources in any way relating to the Financing or the
performance thereof shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State
of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York.

Section 11.4 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits
hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Ancillary Documents,
constitute the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject
matter hereof and supersede all previous agreements, written or oral, relating
to the subject matter hereof.

Section 11.5 Severability. Should any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance be held invalid or
unenforceable to any extent: (a) such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent, and only to the extent, of such unenforceability or prohibition and
shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by Law, (b) such
unenforceability or prohibition in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision as applied to other Persons or
circumstances or in any other jurisdiction, (c) such unenforceability or
prohibition shall not affect or invalidate any other provision of this
Agreement and (d) the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in a reasonable manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby
may be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
Moreover, if any term or other provision of this Agreement shall be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy
because it is excessively broad as to duration, scope, activity or subject,
the parties intend that such provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum
degree necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable under applicable
Law and that such modified provision shall thereafter be enforced to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law.

Section 11.6 Amendment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the terms hereof may
be terminated, amended, supplemented or modified orally, but only by an
instrument in writing signed by Buyer and Seller; provided that (i) the
observance of any provision of this Agreement may be waived in writing by the
party that will lose the benefit of such provision as a result of such waiver
and (ii) Section 7.6, Section 10.5, Section 11.3, this Section 11.6, Section
11.8, Section 11.10, and Section 11.14 (and any related definitions insofar as
they affect such Sections) may not be amended, supplemented, waived, or
otherwise modified in a manner adverse to the Financing Sources, in each case,
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources (other than Non-
Party Affiliates).

Section 11.7 Effect of Waiver or Consent. At any time prior to the Closing,
any party may, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of any other party hereto, (b) extend the time for the performance
of any of the obligations or acts of any other party hereto or (c) unless
prohibited by applicable Law, waive compliance by any other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such party's conditions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or
delay by Seller or Buyer in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude 

any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension
or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of such party.

Section 11.8 Parties in Interest; Limitation on Rights of Others. The terms of
this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall be construed to give any Person (other than
the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns and as
expressly provided herein) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under
or in respect of this Agreement or any covenants, conditions or provisions
contained herein, as a third-party beneficiary or otherwise; provided that (i)
Buyer Indemnitees who are not otherwise a party to this Agreement shall be
express third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement, (ii) Company Released
Parties and Seller Released Parties who are not otherwise a party to this
Agreement shall be express third-party beneficiaries of Section 7.6 and (iii)
the Financing Sources shall be express third-party beneficiaries of Section
10.5, Section 11.3, Section 11.6, this Section 11.8, Section 11.10, and
Section 11.14, each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of
the Financing Sources and the Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on
and enforce the provisions of such Sections.

Section 11.9 Assignability. This Agreement shall not be assigned by Seller
without the prior written consent of Buyer or by Buyer without the prior
written consent of Seller; provided that Buyer may assign all or any portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without such consent to (a)
an Affiliate of Buyer, (b) any wholly owned U.S. Subsidiary of Buyer and/or
(c) any lender (or any agent or other representative thereof) under the Debt
Commitment Letter or any of Buyer's other financing arrangements as collateral
security for Buyer's obligations thereunder (including any refinancings,
extensions, refundings, or renewals thereof), in each case which assignment
shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder.

Section 11.10 Jurisdiction; Court Proceedings; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a)Any Litigation against any party to this Agreement arising out of, in
connection with or relating to this Agreement shall be brought solely in the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana (or, if the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Indiana declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state court sitting in
Indianapolis, Indiana) (the "Chosen Courts") and each of the parties submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for the purpose of any such
Litigation; provided that a final judgment in any such Litigation may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to
assert any (i) objection that it may ever have to the laying of venue of any
such Litigation in either Chosen Court, (ii) Claim that any such Litigation
brought in either Chosen Court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and
(iii) Claim that either Chosen Court does not have personal jurisdiction over
such party with respect to such Litigation; provided that each of the parties
hereto agrees that they will not bring or support any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third party Claim of any kind or description, whether in
law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the
Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Financing (or any alternative or 

replacement financing) or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
New York Supreme Court located in New York County or the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York and the appellate courts
having jurisdiction of appeals in such courts.

(b)Each party agrees that service of process in any Litigation may be made by
mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail or by overnight courier
service, postage prepaid, to it at its address specified herein. Nothing in
this Agreement will affect the right of any party to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.

(c)EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO
THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES OR ANY FINANCING SOURCE IN RESPECT OF THIS
AGREEMENT, ANY FINANCING, OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO, IN EACH
CASE, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER AT LAW OR IN
EQUITY, BASED IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY FURTHER
AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL
WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY
COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

Section 11.11 Remedies.

(a)Subject to Section 10.4, the parties agree that irreparable harm for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy in the
event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of such party
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions.
Accordingly, except as provided in Section 11.11(c), the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
Seller on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, of any of their
respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement, Buyer, on the
one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall be entitled to seek an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity, subject to Section 10.4. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an
adequate remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in equity, subject to Section 10.4
and Section 11.11(c). Subject to Section 11.11(c), each of the parties further
agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any
action of equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with any such Order or injunction.
Except as 

provided in Section 10.4 or Section 11.11(c), the pursuit of an injunction,
specific performance or other equitable relief by any party hereto will not be
deemed a waiver of the right to pursue any other right or remedy (whether at
law or in equity) to which such party may be entitled at any time.

(b)Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any
other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by one party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise at any
time of any other remedy.

(c)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is explicitly agreed
that the right of Seller to obtain an injunction, or other appropriate form of
equitable relief to cause Buyer to complete the Closing shall be subject to
the following: (i) all conditions set forth in Section 8.4 have been satisfied
or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied
at the Closing; provided that each of which shall be capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were on such date), (ii) the Financing has been
funded in full or would be funded in full at the Closing if the Closing were
to occur, (iii) Buyer has failed to complete the Closing in accordance with
Section 2.1 when required to do so hereunder and (iv) Seller has irrevocably
confirmed in writing that, if specific performance is granted and the
Financing is funded, then the Closing will occur pursuant to Section 2.1.

Section 11.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by facsimile
signatures and in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if all
signatory parties had signed the same document. All counterparts shall be
construed together and shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 11.13 Further Assurance. If at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the intent of this Agreement and
to fully effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
of the Ancillary Documents, each of the parties shall take such further action
(including the execution and delivery of such further instruments and
documents) as any other party reasonably may request. Each party shall
cooperate affirmatively with the other parties, to the extent reasonably
requested by such other parties, to enforce the rights and obligations herein
provided.

Section 11.14 No Recourse to Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, each of Seller and the Company (each on behalf of
itself, its controlled Affiliates, its Subsidiaries and its and their
Employees and Representatives) acknowledges and agrees that it (and such other
Persons) shall have no recourse against the Financing Sources, and the
Financing Sources shall be subject to no Liability or Claims by Seller or the
Company (or such other Persons) in connection with any Financing or in any way
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise.

Section 11.15 Legal Representation. In the event any dispute arises following
Closing between Buyer or the Company, on the one hand, and Seller, on the
other hand, Ice Miller LLP may represent Seller even though the interests of
Seller may be directly adverse to Buyer or the Company, and notwithstanding
the prior representation of the Company by Ice Miller LLP. Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that as to all pre-Closing communications between or among Seller
and/ 

or the Company and their respective employees and agents, on the one hand, and
Ice Miller LLP, on the other hand, relating to the Transaction Documents or
the transactions contemplated thereby, the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to and may be controlled by Seller,
and will not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Company. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or the
Company, on the one hand, and a third party (other than a party to this
Agreement), on the other hand, after the Closing, Buyer and the Company may
assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Ice Miller LLP to such third party; provided, however, that
neither Buyer nor the Company may waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Seller.
