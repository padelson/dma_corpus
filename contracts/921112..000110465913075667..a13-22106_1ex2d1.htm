 **PARTNERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

 



 

THIS PARTNERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as
of July 31, 2013 by and among LIBERTY PROPERTY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a
Pennsylvania limited partnership (" _Buyer_ "), CABOT INDUSTRIAL VALUE FUND
III MANAGER, LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Massachusetts limited partnership (the "
_LP Seller_ "), and CABOT INDUSTRIAL VALUE FUND III, INC., a Maryland
corporation (" _General Partner_ ") and the sole general partner of CABOT
INDUSTRIAL VALUE FUND III OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (" _Partnership_ ") and solely for purposes of Section 5.17,
LIBERTY PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT CORP. and CABOT III  PA1W01, L.P. LP Seller and
General Partner are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the " _Seller
Parties_ " or individually as a " _Seller Party_." A list of the defined terms
used in this Agreement and the Section where each is defined is set forth on
_Schedule A_ attached hereto.

 



 

 **RECITALS:**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , LP Seller is the owner and holder of all of the limited
partnership interests in the Partnership as set forth on _Schedule B_ hereto
(the " _LP Interests_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , General Partner is the owner and holder of all of the general
partnership interests in the Partnership as set forth on _Schedule B_ hereto
(the " _GP Interests_ " and, together with the LP Interests, the "
_Partnership Interests_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , Buyer desires, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, to purchase from Seller Parties and Seller Parties desires to
sell to Buyer all of the Partnership Interests owned by Seller Parties free
from any Liens and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement (the " _Partnership Interest Purchase_ ");

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the parties intend that for federal, and applicable state,
income tax purposes the Partnership Interest Purchase will be treated as set
forth in Section 1.9; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Partnership Interest Purchase, and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Partnership Interest Purchase.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the premises and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE I - THE PARTNERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE_**

 



 

 **1.1** ** ****_Purchase and Sale of Partnership Interests_**. Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing,
each Seller Party shall sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Buyer,
and Buyer shall purchase from each Seller Party, all of such Seller

      
 

 



 

Partys right, title and interest as of the Closing Date, in and to the
Partnership Interests set forth next to such Seller Partys name on _Schedule
B_ hereto, free and clear of all Liens.

 



 

 **1.2** ** ****_Closing_**. The closing of the Partnership Interest Purchase
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the date
mutually agreed upon by the parties, which shall be no later than the second
(2nd) Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (excluding the delivery of any documents to be delivered at the
Closing by any of the parties hereto so long as the requirement to deliver
such documents is capable of being satisfied) (the " _Closing Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , the Closing shall not occur prior to October 1, 2013.
" _Business Day_ " means each day, other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day
on which banks in New York, New York are required by Law to close. The Closing
shall occur by means of deposits and instructions with Land Services USA and
U.S. Bank N.A. consistent with the terms, conditions and requirements of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **1.3** ** ****_Purchase Price_**. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, in exchange for all of its Partnership Interests, the Seller
Parties shall receive from Buyer, and Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
the Seller Parties cash in an amount, without interest, equal to the following
consideration (the " _Purchase Consideration_ "):

 



 

(a) at the Closing, an amount of cash equal to $1,475,000,000 (the " _Purchase
Price_ ") as adjusted, pursuant to Sections 1.4(a) and 1.4(b) and as otherwise
expressly permitted in this Agreement (such cash to be allocated among the
Seller Parties pro-rata in accordance with the Seller Parties respective
percentage interests set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto; _provided_ , _that_ the
amount payable to the Seller Parties on the Closing Date shall be calculated
using the Estimated Closing Adjusted Working Capital as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.4 for the purposes of the Section 1.4), less:

 



 

(i) the amount applied to the repayment of any outstanding Indebtedness as
provided in Section 5.9;

 



 

(ii) the amount of Mortgage Debt (as defined below) assumed or repaid as
provided in Section 5.10;

 



 

(iii) the amount of the Indemnification Escrow Amount and the Post-Closing
Adjusted Escrow Amount placed into escrow at the Closing as provided in
Section 1.5(b) and the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(iv) the amount of the Philadelphia Property Purchase Price (as defined
below); and

 



 

(v) $6,000,000, which represents the amount of Buyers expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby in respect of which the
Seller Parties hereby agree to reimburse Buyer at Closing out of the Purchase
Price; and

 



 

(b) following the Closing, a portion of the Indemnification Escrow Amount if
and when due, such portion, if any, to be subject to, and determined in
accordance with, the terms and conditions of Article VII and the Escrow
Agreement; and

 



      
 

 



 

(c) following the Closing, a portion of Post-Closing Adjusted Escrow Amount if
and when due, such portion, if any, to be subject to, and determined in
accordance with, the terms and conditions of Section 1.4 and the Escrow
Agreement.

 



 

The amount payable to the Seller Parties at Closing calculated by clause (a)
of the foregoing sentence is referred to herein as the " _Closing Cash
Payment_."

 



 

 **1.4** ** ****_Adjustment to Closing Cash Payment_**.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller Parties shall in good faith prepare
an estimate of the Pro-Rated Adjustment (the " _Estimated Pro-Rated
Adjustment_ "). Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Seller Parties shall deliver to Buyer a statement setting forth the
calculation of the Estimated Pro-Rated Adjustment in sufficient detail,
together with full supporting information, to enable Buyer to verify all items
and amounts. In connection with common area maintenance and other expense pass
throughs to tenants, the Seller Parties shall provide Buyer with respect to
the Partnership Properties a schedule, broken down by building, and using the
closed-out August 2013 numbers, showing total pass-through operating expenses
vs. total collected pass-through operating expenses (in each case including
estimates where appropriate) and showing estimated overage or shortfall by
building. Any provision to the contrary herein notwithstanding, to the extent
the estimated reconciliation reveals that operating and other reconcilable
expenses were under collected for the period, Buyer shall adjust said amounts
with the Seller Parties on an as and if collected basis in connection with the
tenant reconciliation contemplated under Section 1.4(d). The Estimated Pro-
Rated Adjustment shall be subject to Buyers reasonable approval. As provided
in Section 1.3 hereof, the Closing Cash Payment shall be adjusted, dollar for
dollar, up or down, as appropriate, by the Estimated Pro-Rated Adjustment
(i.e., if the Estimated Pro-Rated Adjustment is a positive number, Buyer will
pay the Estimated Pro-Rated Adjustment in cash at Closing in addition to the
Purchase Price; if the Estimated Pro-Rated Adjustment is a negative number,
Buyer will receive a credit at Closing for such amount). The parties agree
that the adjustment based on Adjusted Working Capital described in Section
1.4(b) is not intended to be duplicative of the adjustment based on the Pro-
Rated Adjustment and, accordingly, the effects of the Pro-Rated Items and
other items included in the calculation of the Pro-Rated Adjustment are not to
be taken into account in calculating the Adjusted Working Capital.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, the Seller Parties shall in good faith prepare
an estimated combined consolidated balance sheet of the Partnership, and the
Partnership Subsidiaries, as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
" _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "). The Estimated Closing Date
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied on a fair value basis
and otherwise consistent with the methodology used to prepare the Most Recent
Balance Sheet and shall also include a calculation of Adjusted Working
Capital, which shall be subject to Buyers reasonable approval, together with
such supporting information as may reasonably be requested, to enable Buyer to
verify all items and amounts. Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Partnership shall deliver to Buyer the Estimated Closing
Date Balance Sheet. As provided in Section 1.3 hereof, the Closing Cash
Payment shall be adjusted, dollar for dollar, up or down, as appropriate, by
the amount that the Adjusted Working Capital set forth on the Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " _Estimated Closing Adjusted_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Working Capital_ ") exceeds or is less than $0.00 (the " _Base Adjusted
Working Capital_ "). The Seller Parties will use reasonable efforts to reduce
payables, collect receivables and take other appropriate actions prior to
Closing, to the extent practicable, to minimize the amount of the Estimated
Closing Adjusted Working Capital.

 



 

(c) As soon as practical after the Closing Date, Buyer shall review the
Partnerships and the Partnership Subsidiaries books and records and also
shall review the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied on a fair value basis, and otherwise consistent with the
methodology used to prepare the Most Recent Balance Sheet and the provisions
of this Section 1.4, and following such review, Buyer shall make any
adjustments necessary thereto consistent with the provisions of this Section
1.4 (the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet, as so adjusted, shall be called
the " _Post-Closing Balance Sheet_ "). Buyer shall, within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, deliver the Post-Closing Balance Sheet to the Seller
Parties, together with worksheets which detail any adjustments and the basis
of any such adjustments and any other information that the Seller Parties may
reasonably request in order to verify or evaluate such adjustments; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the Seller Parties have not prepared any tax returns for
jurisdiction in which the Partnership or any Partnership Subsidiary is
required to pay taxes within the eighty (80) day period pursuant to Section
5.4, such ninety (90) day period shall extend until ten (10) days following
the completion of all such tax returns (which completion shall in no event be
later than 120 days following the Closing and the Seller Parties shall keep
Buyer reasonably informed of the status of completion of such returns and in
any event notify Buyer upon completion). If Buyer fails to deliver the Post-
Closing Balance Sheet to the Seller Parties within such ninety (90) day period
or within ten (10) days following the completion of all such tax returns, as
the case may be, then the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be deemed
to be the Post-Closing Balance Sheet. The Post-Closing Balance Sheet, and the
Adjusted Working Capital, shall be binding upon the parties upon approval in
writing (or upon "deemed approval" pursuant to this Section) of such Post-
Closing Balance Sheet by the Seller Parties and Buyer. The Seller Parties
shall be deemed to have approved the Post-Closing Balance Sheet and the
Adjusted Working Capital at the Closing reflected thereon unless the Seller
Parties has delivered a written statement specifying any disagreement
therewith within fifteen (15) days following its receipt of the Post-Closing
Balance Sheet and accompanying worksheets (a " _Seller Objection Notice_ ").
If the Seller Parties do not agree with the Post-Closing Balance Sheet and the
calculation of Adjusted Working Capital at the Closing stated thereon, then
Buyer and the Seller Parties shall use good faith efforts to resolve their
differences. In the event that Buyer and the Seller Parties cannot resolve
such differences, within fifteen (15) days following receipt by Buyer of the
Seller Objection Notice, then Buyer and the Seller Parties shall select a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually satisfactory to
Buyer and the Seller Parties to resolve such dispute (the " _Neutral Auditor_
"). The Neutral Auditor shall review the Post-Closing Balance Sheet and, as
soon as possible after its appointment, shall make any adjustments necessary
thereto, and upon completion of such review, such Post-Closing Balance Sheet
(and the calculation of the Adjusted Working Capital at the Closing stated
thereon) as determined by the Neutral Auditor shall be binding upon (and
deemed approved by) Buyer and the Seller Parties. The Adjusted Working Capital
at the Closing stated on the version of the Post-Closing Balance Sheet that is
ultimately binding on the parties pursuant to this Section 1.4(c) shall be
referred to as the " _Closing Adjusted Working Capital_." If such a review is
conducted by the Neutral Auditor, then the party (i.e., Buyer, on the one
hand, or the Seller Parties, on the other hand) whose last proposed offer for
the

 



      
 

 



 

settlement of the items in dispute prior to the selection of the Neutral
Auditor, taken as a whole, was farther away from the final determination by
the Neutral Auditor pursuant to the preceding sentence, shall pay all fees and
expenses of the Neutral Auditor associated with such review; _provided_ ,
_that_ the sole and exclusive source for any amounts owed by the Seller
Parties shall be the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount, to the extent
available.

 



 

(d) Within sixty (60) days following Closing, the Seller Parties shall prepare
and deliver to Buyer Seller Parties final proposed 2013 year to date of
Closing reconciliations with tenants under the Partnership Space Leases (which
may include estimates as appropriate, with final information to be provided
when available), together with all necessary supporting documentation
(sufficient to satisfy the requirements of any tenant audit). After Buyer has
completed 2013 year-end reconciliations with the tenants under the Partnership
Space Leases, but in no event later than June 30, 2014, Buyer shall prepare
and present to the Seller Parties for their approval a calculation of the re-
proration of the Pro-Rated Items (excluding leasing commissions, and Tenant
Inducements that are allocated according to Sections 1.4(g)(v)), based upon
the actual amount of such items incurred or received by the parties for the
year or other applicable fiscal period, together with such supporting
documentation as reasonably requested by the Seller Parties. Any disagreement
shall be resolved by a Neutral Auditor in a manner consistent with Section
1.4(c). The re-proration that is ultimately agreed to or binding on the
parties is the " _Closing Pro-Rated Adjustment_ ". To the extent that the
Closing Pro-Rated Adjustment is different from the Estimated Pro-Rated
Adjustment (excluding in each case leasing commissions and Tenant Inducements
that are all allocated according to Section 1.4(g)(v), then, within three (3)
Business Days following the determination of the Closing Pro-Rated Adjustment,
Buyer and the Seller Parties shall appropriately adjust for such difference
either (i) if there is an adjustment in favor of Buyer, by jointly authorizing
and directing the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer from the Post-Closing Adjusted
Escrow Amount within three (3) Business Days following delivery of such
authorization an amount equal to the difference between such amounts, and (ii)
if there is an adjustment in favor of the Seller Parties, by Buyer paying to
the Seller Parties the difference between such amounts by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

 



 

(e) Within three (3) Business Days following the determination of the Closing
Adjusted Working Capital in accordance with Section 1.4(c), (i) in the event
the Closing Adjusted Working Capital, is less than the Estimated Closing
Adjusted Working Capital, Buyer and the Seller Parties shall jointly authorize
and direct the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer from the Post-Closing Adjusted
Escrow Amount within three (3) Business Days following delivery of such
authorization an amount equal to the difference between such amounts, and (ii)
in the event the Closing Adjusted Working Capital, is greater than the
Estimated Closing Adjusted Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to the Seller
Parties the difference between such amounts by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts for six (6) months after the
Closing Date (and, with respect to sums, if any, due to Seller Parties
relating to collections resulting from the 2013 reconciliation with tenants,
for six (6) months following the delivery of the annual reconciliation
statements) to collect any Uncollected Tenant Payments; _provided_ , _however_
, Buyer will not be obligated to commence any suit or proceeding to collect
any Uncollected Tenant Payments or to evict any tenant for the failure to pay
such sums. Buyer shall not be

 



       
 

 



 

obligated to thereafter pursue any such past due amounts. Buyer will be
obligated to promptly pay to the Seller Parties an amount equal to any
Uncollected Tenant Payments not accounted for in the calculation of the
Closing Pro-Rated Adjustment only to the extent that such Uncollected Tenant
Payments are subsequently collected within said six (6) month period, and
subject to the provisions of Section 1.4(g)(vi)(E).

 



 

(g) As used in this Section 1.4:

 



 

(i) " _Adjusted Working Capital_ " means Current Assets minus Current
Liabilities, as adjusted to net out the effect of the Pro-Rated Items and the
other items included in the calculation of the Pro-Rated Adjustment.

 



 

(ii) " _Current Assets_ " means and includes all accounts receivable
(excluding Uncollected Tenant Payments), cash, cash equivalents and such other
current assets of the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries, in each
case as determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied on a fair
value basis.

 



 

(iii) " _Current Liabilities_ " means and includes all accounts payable,
accrued expenses, expenses of the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries
under Section 3, accrued but unpaid taxes, deferred revenues and all other
liabilities of the Partnership, and the Partnership Subsidiaries, in each case
as determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied on a fair value
basis. Current Liabilities shall not include any portion of Mortgage Debt.

 



 

(iv) " _Pro-Rated Adjustment_ " shall equal (A) the sum of (x), with respect
only to the post-Closing determination of the Closing Pro-Rated Adjustment
under Section 1.4(d), all income of the Partnership and the Partnership
Subsidiaries on a combined consolidated basis attributable to the Pro-Rated
Items for periods prior to the Closing Date that is collected after the
Closing Date (subject to the provisions of Section 1.4(g)(vi)(E)), plus (y)
all expenses of the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries on a combined
basis attributable to the Pro-Rated Items for periods on or after the Closing
Date that have been paid as of the Closing Date, minus (B) the sum of (x) all
income of the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries on a combined
consolidated basis attributable to the Pro-Rated Items for periods on or after
the Closing Date that has been collected as of the Closing Date, plus (y) all
expenses of the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries on a combined
consolidated basis attributable to the Pro-Rated Items for periods prior to
the Closing Date that have not been paid as of the Closing Date. Income and
expenses attributed to the Pro-Rated Items will be allocated among these time
periods as follows, except as otherwise specified herein with respect to a
Pro-Rated Item: (A) income and expenses relating to the Pro-Rated Items with
respect to periods beginning prior to the Closing Date and ending on or after
the Closing Date will be allocated based on a 365 day year in the applicable
period (e.g., collected rent for the month in which the Closing occurs will be
prorated based on the number of days in the month) and (B) all other income
and expenses will be allocated to the period to which it relates (e.g.,
collected rent for a month beginning after the Closing Date shall be credited
in full to that time period).

 



      
 

 



 

(v) The Pro-Rated Adjustment will be: (A) increased by the unamortized cost
(evenly amortized over the initial rent term) of leasing commissions and
Tenant Inducements (which for all purposes of this Section 1.4(g)(v) excludes
any free rent) borne by the lessor with respect to Partnership Space Leases
entered into on or after July 20, 2013 and new leases and Lease Modifications
executed in accordance with Sections 4.2 and 4.3 and any other new lease
executed that does not require notice to or approval of Buyer, in each case
that have been paid on or before the Closing Date, but only to the extent that
such costs with respect to Lease Modifications are consistent with the leasing
parameters referenced in Section 4.2 (the " _Leasing Parameters_ ") unless
otherwise reasonably approved by Buyer, (B) decreased by the amount of any
leasing commissions and Tenant Inducements with respect to the current terms
of the Partnership Space Leases entered into prior to July 20, 2013 that have
not been paid or provided on or before the Closing Date, and (C) decreased by
the amortized cost (evenly amortized over the initial rent term) (i.e. the
costs attributable to the pre-Closing portion of the term (following the rent
commencement date)) of leasing commissions and Tenant Inducements borne by the
lessor with respect to Partnership Space Leases entered into on or after July
20, 2013 and new leases and Lease Modifications executed in accordance with
Sections 4.2 (except as provided at (D) below) and 4.3, in each case that have
not been paid on or before the Closing Date, and (D) decreased by the amount
of any unpaid leasing commissions and Tenant Inducements borne by the lessor
with respect to Lease Modifications executed in accordance with Section 4.2 or
that do not require notice to or approval of Buyer, in each case which are not
consistent with the Leasing Parameters and not otherwise approved by Buyer.
The Estimated Pro-Rated Adjustment shall include an estimate of the costs of
the items under clauses (A) through (D) above. Buyer and the Seller Parties
shall jointly authorize and direct the Escrow Agent to promptly pay to Buyer
or the Seller Parties, as the case may be, out of the escrow established under
the Escrow Agreement, the amount by which the aggregate Estimated Pro-Rated
Adjustment for such items is less than, or greater than, the final aggregate
Pro-Rated Adjustment for such items.

 



 

(vi) The " _Pro-Rated Items_ " shall consist of the following:

 



 

(A) All real and personal property taxes and installments of special
assessments with respect to Partnership Properties through the year in which
the Closing occurs on an accrual basis (regardless of whether such taxes and
special assessments are then due and payable or delinquent, but with such
accruals modified to reflect custom in certain jurisdictions as set forth on
_Schedule C_ attached hereto). If any such taxes or assessments for the fiscal
year during which the Closing Date occurs are not finally determined, then the
tax or assessment figures for the immediately prior fiscal year shall be used
(provided, however, if the current years assessment is available, real estate
taxes will be prorated based upon the prior years millage applied to the
current years assessment). To the extent that any real property taxes
assessed with respect to the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs have not
been finally determined by the applicable Government Entity on or before June
30, 2014, then the Seller Parties and Buyer shall act reasonably and in good

 



      
 

 



 

faith to agree on an estimated amount of such real property taxes, which
agreed-upon estimate shall be used for the re-proportion of the Pro-Rated
Items and the Closing Pro-Rated Adjustment. If the Seller Parties and Buyer do
not reach agreement on such estimated real property taxes on or before June
30, 2014 despite such good faith reasonable efforts, then such estimated taxes
shall be finally determined by a mutually agreed upon real property tax
consulting firm with experience in the applicable jurisdiction and, if the
Seller Parties and Buyer do not agree on such consulting firm prior to June
30, 2014, then such consulting firm shall be selected by the national head of
the real property tax consulting group (or comparable position) at KPMG. Such
consulting firm shall be required to complete such determination within 60
days after the June 30, 2014; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such real
property taxes are finally determined during such interim period, then such
real property taxes will be used. The determination of such consulting firm
shall be final and binding on the Seller Parties and Buyer, and the costs of
such consulting firm (and KPMG, if applicable) shall be paid fifty (50)
percent by the Seller Parties and fifty (50) percent by Buyer.

 



 

(B) All amounts owed or accrued with respect to, or under the documents
governing, the Mortgage Debt (other than repayments of principal).

 



 

(C) All operating expenses and other apportionable expenses, including, but
not limited to, assessments and other obligations under private covenants and
easements, maintenance expenses, management fees (if applicable), and all
amounts owed or accrued with respect to electricity, gas, water, sewer or
other utility usage at the Partnership Properties. Partnership will use
reasonable efforts to cause all meters for electricity, gas, water, sewer or
other utility usage at the Partnership Properties to be read on the Closing
Date. The utility charges based on the most recent bills shall be used for the
purposes of calculating the Estimated Pro-Rated Closing Adjustment.
Partnership shall provide notice to Buyer five (5) days prior to the Closing
Date setting forth (i) whether utility meters will be read as of the Closing
Date and (ii) a copy of the most recent bills for the utility charges at the
Partnership Properties.

 



 

(D) Collected rents for the current period and security deposits (the full
amount thereof to be credited to Buyer with interest earned thereon required
to be paid to the applicable tenant and not so paid, if any); prepaid rentals;
common area maintenance charges; promotional charges; service charges; tax
charges; and all other incidental expenses and charges paid by current, former
or prospective tenants at the Partnership Properties, in each case only to the
extent collected for the current period and any future periods.

 



      
 

 



 

(E) All rents and related charges for the current period in which the Closing
occurs and prior rental periods (including common area maintenance charges,
annual adjustments thereto and annual tenant reconciliations) that are
collected after the Closing Date, less any reasonable third party out-of-
pocket expenses of collection thereof (" _Uncollected Tenant Payments_ "). For
the avoidance of doubt, Uncollected Tenant Payments shall not be pro-rated
unless and until they are collected, and in such case, only with respect to
the post-Closing determination of the Closing Pro-Rated Adjustment under
Section 1.4(d). All Uncollected Tenant Payments shall be first applied to
amounts due and payable for rental periods accruing after the Closing Date.

 



 

(F) Lease termination payments paid or payable by tenants in respect of the
termination of any Partnership Space Lease occurring (or termination right
exercised) during the period between July 20, 2013 and the Closing Date. Such
termination payments shall be apportioned between the Seller Parties and
Buyer, with Buyer receiving a credit in an amount equal to the total lease
termination payment multiplied by the quotient of (i) the number of days from
the Closing Date through the scheduled expiration of the current Lease term
(but for the early termination), divided by (ii) the number of days from the
early termination date through the scheduled expiration of the current Lease
term (but for the early termination) and without giving effect to any
unexercised extensions.

 



 

(vii) The Pro-Rated Items shall not include taxes, utilities or other amounts
to the extent that they are directly paid by a tenant to the applicable
service provider or taxing authority.

 



 

 **1.5** ** ****_Signing Deposit; Escrow and Escrow Agreement_**.

 



 

(a) Within one day following the date hereof, Buyer will deliver to US Bank
N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), a sum equal to Twenty-Five Million Dollars
($25,000,000.00) as a deposit (together with any interest earned thereon while
held in escrow, the " _Signing Deposit_ "). Time is of the essence with
respect to the funding of the Signing Deposit, and failure to timely fund the
Signing Deposit shall constitute a default by Buyer under this Agreement
entitling Seller Parties to terminate this Agreement. The Signing Deposit
shall be held in escrow by the Escrow Agent in an interest-bearing account
pursuant to and in accordance with the escrow agreement attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ and executed on the date hereof (the " _Deposit Escrow Agreement_
"). At the Closing, an amount of the Signing Deposit equal to the full amount
of the Indemnification Escrow Amount shall be retained by the Escrow Agent as
the Indemnification Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 1.5(b), an amount of the
Signing Deposit equal to the full amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount shall be retained by the Escrow Agent as the Post-Closing Adjustment
Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 1.5(b), and the remainder of the Signing
Deposit shall be paid to the Seller Parties and the entire Signing Deposit
shall be credited against the Purchase Consideration pursuant to Section 1.3.
If this Agreement is

 



      
 

 



 

terminated prior to the Closing pursuant to Article VIII, the Signing Deposit
will be handled as set forth in such provisions.

 



 

(b) Section 1.4 provides for possible post-closing adjustments of the Closing
Cash Payment and Article VII provides that Buyer is entitled to
indemnification from and against certain Losses. At the Closing, the Seller
Parties, Buyer and the Escrow Agent shall enter into an escrow agreement
substantially in the form _Exhibit B_ attached hereto (the " _Escrow
Agreement_ "). The Escrow Agreement provides for the formation of two escrow
funds to accommodate such adjustments and indemnification rights. At the
Closing, the parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to (i) deposit cash held
pursuant to the Deposit Escrow Agreement into one escrow fund a sum equal to
[the confidential material contained herein has been omitted and has been
separately filed with the Commission] (as contemplated by Section 1.5(a)
above), which shall constitute a portion of the Purchase Consideration and
secure and serve as the sole and exclusive remedy for satisfying Buyers
rights to payments under Section 1.4 (the " _Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow
Amount_ "), and (ii) deposit cash held pursuant to the Deposit Escrow
Agreement into the second escrow fund a sum equal to Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000.00) (as contemplated by Section 1.5(a) above), which shall
constitute a portion of the Purchase Consideration and which shall secure and
serve as the sole and exclusive remedy for satisfying Buyers rights to
indemnification payments under Article VII of this Agreement (the "
_Indemnification Escrow Amount_ " and together with the Post-Closing
Adjustment Escrow Amount, the " _Escrow Amount_ "). The Escrow Amount will be
funded by the Signing Deposit.

 



 

(c) Buyer, Partnership and the Seller Parties shall treat the Escrow Agreement
and the contingent consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.4 as causing
the Partnership Interest Purchase to constitute a contingent payment sale
reportable under the installment sale method as provided in Section 453 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and United States
Treasury Regulation Section 15A.453-1(c). Consistent with the foregoing and
with Proposed Treasury Regulations Section 1.468B-8(c), for all relevant tax
purposes the parties hereto shall treat Buyer as the owner of the Signing
Deposit, the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnification
Escrow Amount and shall not treat any amount deposited in the Signing Deposit,
the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnification Escrow
Amount or owing pursuant to Section 1.4 as having been actually or
constructively paid to the Seller Parties until such amount is released or
paid to the Seller Parties pursuant to the terms of the Deposit Escrow
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the relevant Section of this Agreement, as
applicable. Nothing in this Section 1.5(c) is intended or shall be construed
as limiting any limited partners right to elect not to report on the
installment method pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 15A. 453-1(d). The
parties hereto agree that to the extent income and earnings on the Signing
Deposit, the Post-Closing Adjustment Escrow Amount, and/or the Indemnification
Escrow Amount exceed imputed interest under the relevant provisions of the
Code, such excess shall be treated as additional stated interest for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. The intention of the preceding sentence is to
ensure that the rights of the Seller Parties to any amounts in escrow are not
treated as part of a contingent payment sale lacking a stated maximum selling
price.

 



      
 

 



 

 **1.6** ** ****_Intentionally Omitted_**.

 



 

 **1.7** ** ****_Payment Procedures_**.

 



 

(a) _Payments_. Buyer shall make payment of all amounts to be paid by Buyer to
the Seller Parties under this Agreement as per written instructions provided
by such Seller Parties in advance.

 



 

(b) _No Further Ownership Rights in Partnership Interests_. At the Closing,
holders of Partnership Interests shall cease to be, and shall have no rights
as Partners other than to receive the Purchase Consideration under this
Article I. After the Closing, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the transfer books of the Partnership of the Partnership
Interests that were outstanding immediately prior to the Closing.

 



 

(c) _Withholding Rights_. Buyer or the Seller Parties (or the Escrow Agent or
any other agent or affiliate of the foregoing), as applicable, shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local
or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, and are paid
to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

 **1.8** ** ****_Purchase Price Allocation_**. The Purchase Price shall be
allocated among the Partnership Properties prior to the Closing as determined
by Buyer. No party shall take any position for Tax, accounting or other
purposes that is inconsistent with such allocation except to the extent
otherwise required by a final determination by any tax or other regulatory
authority. Buyer shall keep the Seller Parties reasonably informed throughout
its process of determination of such allocation.

 



 

 **1.9** ** ****_Tax Treatment of Partnership Interest Purchase_**. It is the
intention of the parties hereto that consistent with Revenue Ruling 99-6,
1999-1 CB 432 (Situation 2), the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
shall be treated as (A) a sale by the Seller Parties of one hundred (100)
percent of the Partnership Interests to Buyer and (B) a purchase by Buyer of
the Partnerships assets.

 



 

 **1.10** ** ****_Time of the Essence_**. The parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that time is of the essence in consummating the Partnership Interest
Purchase and the delivery of the Purchase Consideration.

have been satisfied or waived), Buyer will have at the Closing sufficient cash
to make payment of all amounts to be paid by them hereunder on and after the
Closing Date. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which would result
in any breach or violation of or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would

have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will
not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Buyer on the

to be paid on or prior to the date hereof pursuant to the Financing Letters.

Seller Parties will not cause or permit the Partnership or any Partnership
Subsidiary to cancel, amend, or modify any material Contract or enter into any
Lease Modification (as defined below), in a manner binding upon Buyer after
the Closing, unless the cancelation, amendment or modification is necessary to

notice within five (5) Business Days after such action, with a copy of the
applicable document. As used herein, " _Lease Modification_ " means any
amendments, extensions, expansions, terminations, or assignments or subleases

 



      
 

 



 

relating to any of the Partnership Space Leases or Ground Leases.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.2, Seller Parties
may cause the Partnership or applicable Partnership Subsidiary to enter into
any Lease Modification in the nature of an extension or renewal of the term of
a Partnership Space Lease so long as such Partnership Space Lease and Lease
Modification meet all of the following criteria: (i) the applicable leased

$1.50 per square foot; and (iv) such Lease Modification does not create any
new rights of first refusal, first offer or expansion.

 



 

 **4.3** ** ****_New Leases and Contracts_**. Seller Parties will not cause or
permit the Partnership or any Partnership Subsidiary to enter into any new
lease or contract without Buyers prior written consent. Notwithstanding the
preceding sentence, Seller Parties may cause the Partnership or applicable
Partnership Subsidiary to enter into any new contracts without Buyers consent
if doing so is in the ordinary course of operating the Partnership Property
and the contract (i) will not be binding on Buyer or (ii) is cancelable on
thirty (30) days or less notice without penalty or premium.

 



 

The following procedure will govern Buyers review and consent to new leases
and Lease Modifications: If Seller Parties seek Buyers consent with respect
to any new lease or Lease Modification, the Seller Parties shall provide Buyer
with the following information: (i) a written term sheet (a " _Lease Term
Sheet_ ") summarizing the material terms for the new lease or Lease
Modification (including a summary of the estimated Tenant Inducement Costs and
leasing commissions; (ii) if available, the current draft of the proposed new
lease or Lease Modification, and (iii) any current tenant financial
information in the possession of the Seller Parties (Buyer shall keep all
tenant financial information provided by Seller Parties confidential).
Excepting leases in negotiation as of the date of this Agreement, and leases
for national tenants requiring that their own form be used, new leases will be
based on Buyers standard industrial lease form.

 



 

If Seller Parties shall request Buyers approval to any of the foregoing
matters, Buyer shall have five (5) Business Days from its receipt of such
request (with all required accompanying information) to give Seller Parties
notice of its approval or disapproval of such matter. If Buyer does not timely
give such notice, such matter shall be deemed approved by Buyer.

 



 

 **4.4** ** ****_No Solicitation_**.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, Seller Parties shall
not, and shall not authorize or permit the Partnership or any of the
Partnership Subsidiaries, or any of its or their officers, trustees,
directors, partners, affiliates or employees or any investment banker,
financial advisor, attorney, accountant, agent or other representative
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Seller
Representatives_ "), directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries, proposals or offers
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) initiate or, participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal (including
providing non-public information in connection therewith provided that, if
provided, such non public information must also promptly be

 



      
 

 



 

provided to Buyer) or (iii) approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or
enter into any binding merger agreement, letter of intent, ownership interest
purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or ownership interest exchange
agreement, option agreement or other similar binding agreement providing for
or relating to an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement requiring
Seller Parties to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or agree to do any of the foregoing. " _Acquisition
Proposal_ " means (i) a merger, tender offer, recapitalization, or
consolidation, or any similar transaction, involving the Partnership or any of
the Partnership Subsidiaries or any Person (a " _Partnership Control Person_
") that, directly or indirectly, controls the Partnership, where "control"
means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause
the direction of management policies of the Partnership, whether through the
ownership of voting securities, by Contract, as trustee or otherwise, (ii) a
purchase, lease or other acquisition or assumption of all or a substantial
portion of the assets of the Partnership or all or a substantial portion of
the assets of any of the Partnership Subsidiaries or of a Partnership Control

consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term
"beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning
assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder) of securities of the
Partnership or any of the Partnership Subsidiaries or any Partnership Control
Person, or (iv) any substantially similar transaction; _provided_ , _however_
, that the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall not include the Partnership
Interest Purchase or the other transactions contemplated hereby or herein or
by any of the other related documents.

 



 

(b) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Seller Parties, the Partnership and
the Partnership Subsidiaries shall cease immediately and shall cause to be
terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with
any parties conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by or
on behalf of the Partnership or any of the Seller Representatives and shall
inform each of the Seller Representatives of its obligations under this
Section 4.2.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE V - ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_**

 



 

 **5.1** ** ****_Due Diligence_**.

 



 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Article V, Seller Parties shall, and
shall cause the Partnership and each of the Partnership Subsidiaries to,
afford to Buyer and to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors and other representatives of Buyer, reasonable access
during normal business hours prior to the Closing to the Partnership
Properties and to all their respective books, contracts, and records and,
during such period, Seller Parties shall, and shall cause the Partnership and
each of the Partnership Subsidiaries to, make available promptly to the other
parties such information within their possession or control concerning the
Partnerships and the Partnership Subsidiaries business and Partnership
Properties as such other party may reasonably request, including formation
documents, tax records and other additional customarily requested corporate
due diligence items for the Partnership and the Partnership Subsidiaries;
Partnership Space Leases and Guaranties, updated tenant financial statements,
rent rolls, operating statements, the latest property tax bills and value
renditions; environmental reports concerning the Partnership Properties;
material governmental permits, licenses and approvals; site plans; any soils
reports on the Partnership Properties; certificates of insurance and

 



      
 

 



 

material notices from insurance carriers; plans and specifications (if
requested, and which may be reviewed by Buyer at the Partnerships offices);
materials related to litigation, condemnation or other proceedings affecting
the Partnership Properties; and any building condition reports or roofing
reports. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree that (A) any investigation by Buyer shall
not unreasonably interfere with any of the businesses or operations of the
Partnership or its Subsidiaries, and (B) Buyer shall, upon reasonable request,
be able to meet with management of the Partnership and with lenders of the
Mortgage Debt and tenants of the Partnership Properties in coordination with
management of the Partnership.

 



 

(b) Subject to the rights of the tenants of the Partnership Properties, Buyer,
its agents and representatives shall have the right to inspect the Partnership
Properties and make investigations thereon, including so-called "Phase I"
environmental investigations; _provided_ , _however_ , that no so-called
"Phase II" environmental investigation or testing or other invasive or
destructive investigation or testing will be done without the Seller Parties
written permission, which the Seller Parties may withhold in their sole
discretion. Upon the completion of any such inspection or test, Buyer shall
restore the applicable Property to its condition prior to such inspection or
test. The Seller Parties shall have the right to have a representative present
at any such inspection or test as long as such requirement does not materially
delay such inspection or test. All such inspections shall be at Buyers sole
expense and shall be in accordance with applicable Laws, including, without
limitation, Laws relating to worker safety and the proper disposal of
discarded materials.

 



 

(c) Each of Buyer Party agrees to indemnify, the Seller Parties, the
Partnership and each Partnership Subsidiary from and against any and all
Losses arising out of or resulting from the entry on any property and/or the
conduct of any due diligence (as opposed to any existing condition discovered
through such due diligence), by Buyer or any of their respective affiliates,
associates, partners, employees, directors, officers, agents, counsel,
auditors, investment bankers, representatives and advisors, except to the
extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Partnership
or its affiliates. The foregoing notwithstanding, Buyer shall not have any
liability hereunder for any claims resulting from or relating to any existing
conditions, including but not limited to, any Hazardous Materials detected by
Buyers inspections, except to the extent such existing conditions have been
exacerbated due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
Buyer or any of Buyers representatives, agents or contractors during the
course of Buyers inspections. Prior to entering any Partnership Property,
Buyer shall (i) obtain policies of general liability insurance which insure
Buyer, its agents and representatives with liability insurance limits of not
less than $2,000,000 combined single limit for personal injury and property
damage and name the Partnership as an additional insured and which are with
such insurance companies, provide such coverages and carry such other limits
as the Seller Parties shall reasonably require, and (ii) provide the Seller
Parties with certificates of insurance evidencing that Buyer has obtained the
aforementioned policies of insurance.

 



 

(d) Except as provided in Section 5.1(e) below, Buyer acknowledges that it has
completed, and is satisfied with, its due diligence review of the Partnership
and the Partnership Subsidiaries, the physical condition of the Partnership
Properties, the condition of title to the Partnership Properties (including
obtaining such updated title reports or title insurance

 



      
 

 



 

commitments and updated surveys as Buyer deems appropriate) and the
Partnership Properties suitability for Buyers intended investment. Buyer
shall have the right to continue its inspections and investigations as
provided in this Section 5, but shall have no right to terminate this
Agreement as a result of such inspections and investigations. Seller Parties
shall, and shall cause the Partnership and each of the Partnership
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate to answer Buyers reasonable questions
arising out of Buyers continuing due diligence; _provided_ , _however_ ,
Buyer shall have no right to terminate this Agreement and receive back the
Signing Deposit as the result of such questions. The foregoing
notwithstanding, nothing herein shall be construed to affect or otherwise
limit Buyers rights under Article VI with respect to conditions of Closing or
Buyers right to rely upon the representations and warranties provided by the
Seller Parties in Article II of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Partnership
delivered or provided access to Buyer or its counsel, for each Partnership
Property, copies of the most recent title insurance policy (each, an "
_Existing Policy_ ") and the most recent survey in the Partnerships
possession (each, an " _Existing Survey_ "). Through Escrow Agent, Buyer has
ordered from First American Title Insurance Company (" _Title Company_ ")
title insurance commitment(s) (the " _Title Commitments_ ") obligating the
Title Company to issue for each Partnership Property a new owners title
insurance policy or a date-down endorsement to an Existing Policy (or
leasehold policy, with respect to any Partnership Properties subject to Ground
Leases) (collectively, the " _Owner s Title Policies_"), together with such
endorsements and affirmative coverage desired by Buyer to provide primary
coverage up to an insured amount agreeable to Buyer for all Partnership
Properties; however, Buyer shall have the right to require re-insurance from
such national underwriters identified by Buyer as needed, requested or as
required by Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, any additional premiums incurred as a result of any re-insurance
requested by Buyer shall be at Buyers expense. Buyer has also ordered, prior
to the date of this Agreement, at Buyers sole cost and expense, updates to
each of the Existing Surveys (the " _Survey Updates_ "), and Buyer shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such Survey Updates are
completed by August 31, 2013. Buyer has received and completed its review of
the Title Commitments and Existing Surveys for the Partnership Properties
identified on _Schedule 5.1(e)-A_ (the " _Reviewed Properties_ "); and as of
the date hereof Buyer is still reviewing the Title Commitments and Existing
Surveys for the Partnership Properties identified on _Schedule 5.1(e)-B_ (the
" _Non-Reviewed Properties_ "). _Schedule 5.1(e)-A_ also lists matters that
Buyer believes may be Material Title Defects (as defined below) identified by
Buyer with respect to the Reviewed Properties as a result of Buyers review
thereof and, except for New Title Defects, Buyer shall have no right to object
to any title or survey matters relating to the Reviewed Properties. Buyer
shall have until 5:00 p.m. eastern time on August 9, 2013 to complete its
review of the Title Commitments and Existing Surveys for the Non-Reviewed
Properties (the " _Title Review Deadline_ ") and notify Seller Parties of any
matters it believes may be Material Title Defects relating to the Non-Reviewed
Properties. Except for New Title Defects, Buyer shall have no right to object
to any title or survey matters relating to the Non-Reviewed Properties at any
time after the Title Review Deadline. Seller Parties shall, and shall cause
the Partnership and each of the Partnership Subsidiaries to (all at Seller
Parties sole cost and expense), use commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve any Material Title Defects, to the extent timely raised in accordance
with the requirements of this paragraph (e), and New Title Defects, in each
case to Buyers commercially reasonable satisfaction. Such efforts may include
causing the Title Company (whether pursuant

 



      
 

 



 

to undertakings, escrows, or indemnities provided to the Title Company by
Seller Parties, or otherwise) to remove such objection as an exception to
title in the Owners Title Policy issued at Closing or affirmatively insure
against the same (which insurance shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer in
form and substance), in either case without any additional cost or liability
to Buyer and without retention of any liability by the Partnership or any
Partnership Subsidiary. Any such undertakings and/or indemnities shall be
funded solely out of the Indemnification Escrow Amount. The foregoing
notwithstanding, nothing herein shall be construed to affect or otherwise
limit the obligations of the Seller Parties under Section 5(f) immediately
below. " _Material Title Defect_ " means any defect or encumbrance that, based
on the standards prevailing among institutional real estate purchasers and
lenders, would be deemed to materially and adversely affect the marketability,
financeability, value or continued use and operation of the subject property
as presently used and operated. It shall not be considered a Material Title
Defect that a use or structure (including setbacks) or amount of parking is a
legal nonconforming use or structure (including setbacks) or amount of
parking. " _New Title Defect_ " means any Material Title Defect of which (i)
Buyer did not have prior Knowledge, (ii) was not caused by Buyer or any Person
on behalf of Buyer, (iii) was not otherwise consented to by Buyer in writing,
and (iv) either (A) first arising after (1) the date of this Agreement, in the
case of the Reviewed Properties, or (2) the Title Review Deadline, in the case
of the Non-Reviewed Properties, or (B) first discovered by Buyer following
Buyers receipt and review of documentation not reasonably available to Buyer
prior to (1) the date of this Agreement, in the case of the Reviewed
Properties, or (2) the Title Review Deadline, in the case of the Non-Reviewed
Properties (including, in each case, any Survey Updates not received by Buyer
by the applicable date, to the extent timely ordered and pursued by Buyer in
accordance with the requirements set forth above, but in any event Buyer shall
notify Seller Parties of any potential Material Title Defect raised by Survey
Updates on or before September 4, 2014). The Seller Parties covenant and agree
that at or prior to Closing, the Partnership shall (and regardless of whether
identified by Buyer as a Material Title Defect) : (i) pay in full and cause to
be canceled and discharged, all mechanics and contractors liens which
encumber any Partnership Property as of the Closing Date for work performed
during the Partnerships or any Partnership Subsidiarys period ownership (and
shall pay in full or bond over at the Seller Parties expense any charges for
such labor or materials that could give rise to such a lien), other than such
liens which only encumber a tenants leasehold estate or are reimbursable by
or otherwise the responsibility of a tenant under a Partnership Space Lease or
lease executed pursuant to Section 4.3; (ii) pay all liens or encumbrances
against such Partnership Property or any personal property that is used in
connection therewith which evidence monetary obligations of the Partnership or
any Subsidiary (excluding liens securing the Mortgage Debt) including liens
for past due taxes and assessments; (iii) cause to be released any loan
security documents of any the Partnership or any Subsidiary which encumbers
any Partnership Property or personal property, except for the loan documents
evidencing and securing the Mortgage Debt; and (iv) pay (by bonding or
otherwise) and obtain the release of all judgment liens against the
Partnership or any Partnership Subsidiary on such Partnership Property or
personal property that is used in connection therewith. The liens, judgments
and encumbrances referred to in this Section 5.1(e) must be satisfied by the
Partnership prior to or at Closing, and if not so satisfied, shall be
satisfied at Closing out of the Closing Cash Payment without adjustment to the
Purchase Consideration. The Seller Parties may satisfy their obligation to
clear title with respect to any item described above that it contests in good
faith if, without retention of any liability by the Seller Parties, the

 



      
 

 



 

Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, the Seller
Parties either: (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary to remove,
satisfy or cure (of record or otherwise, as appropriate) such objection; (b)
cause the Title Company to remove such objection as an exception to title in
the Owners Title Policy issued at Closing or affirmatively insure against the
same (which insurance shall be reasonably satisfactory to Buyer in form and
substance), in either case without any additional cost or liability to Buyer
and without retention of any liability by the Partnership or any Partnership
Subsidiary. To the extent that funds are needed to cure any such exception,
the Seller Parties shall cause any portion of the Closing Cash Payment being
paid at Closing to be delivered to the Title Company to cure same. If title to
any Partnership Property becomes encumbered by any _lis pendens_ or similar
attachment which is being disputed in good faith by the Partnership or any
Partnership Subsidiary, then the Seller Parties and Buyer shall act reasonably
and in good faith to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution with respect to
such Partnership Property.

 



 

(f) Buyer may, at Buyers expense, seek to obtain estoppels from the
assessing/governing entity under applicable declarations, restrictive
covenants and easement agreements affecting the Partnership Properties. Seller
Parties shall, and shall cause the Partnership and each of the Partnership
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Buyers efforts to obtain same.
Receipt of such estoppels will not, however, be a condition to the Closing.

 



 

 **5.2** ** ****_Confidentiality_**. Prior to the Closing, the parties will
maintain the confidentiality of and not disclose the terms or existence of
this Agreement, the exhibits hereto, the other documentation relating hereto
and thereto, the transactions contemplated by such documentation, including,
without limitation, Partnership Interest Purchase, the materials supplied
pursuant to Section 5.1 and the results of the reviews and tests pursuant to
Section 5.1, except that (a) Buyer may disclose the terms thereof to its
consultants and advisors, and further may disclose such terms as are necessary
or required to be disclosed in connection with its due diligence
investigations or by applicable Law or rules of any securities exchange
applicable to Buyer or its affiliates and (b) the Seller Parties may disclose
the terms thereof to its consultants and advisors, the Limited Partners,
prospective investors in a follow-on real estate fund formed by Cabot
Properties, Inc. or its affiliates (" _Prospective Investors_ ") and the
Partnerships lenders, and further may disclose such terms as are necessary or
required to be disclosed under applicable Law. In addition, Buyer may disclose
the terms hereof to its investors and lenders in accordance with applicable
Law. Buyer may not disclose any such information prior to the Closing to its
consultants, advisors, investors and lenders unless they inform such Persons

return or the payment of any Tax, if such election, adoption, change,
amendment, agreement settlement, surrender, consent or other actions would
have the effect of increasing the liability for Taxes for any period ending
after the Closing Date for either the Partnership, any Partnership Subsidiary,
Buyer or any direct or indirect owner of Buyer.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller Parties shall file all Tax returns
and other reports required to be filed with all taxing authorities in the

 **5.10** ** ****_Mortgage Debt_**.

Payment) as contemplated by Section 1.3.

when needed to satisfy Buyers public reporting obligations in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and permit Buyers
independent registered public accounting firm reasonable access to the books
and records of the Seller Parties for the purpose of conducting an audit of
such financial statements. The Seller Parties agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to give Buyer and its accountants access to such of its

 **5.14** ** ****_Request for Tenant Estoppel Certificates_**. The Seller
Parties shall promptly cause the Partnership to request and use reasonable
efforts to obtain duly executed estoppel certificates from each tenant leasing
35,000 square feet or more at one of the Partnership Properties (other than
the properties located in the U.K. (the " _U.K. Properties_ ") since tenant
estoppels are not customary in the U.K.) in a form that meets the requirements
of Section 6.2(e). To the extent any such lease is the subject of a Guaranty,

Property listed on _Schedule 5.17_ of the Seller Parties Disclosure Letter
(the " _Philadelphia Property_ ") for a cash payment equal to the purchase
price allocation for the Philadelphia Property determined in accordance with
Section 1.8 (the " _Philadelphia Property Purchase Price_ "). Upon such
election by Buyer, the sale of the Philadelphia Property (the " _Philadelphia
Property Disposition_ ") shall be effected pursuant to mutually reasonably
acceptable closing documentation which the parties shall negotiate in good
faith prior to the Closing and which shall, in any event, not increase or
decrease the rights and remedies the parties would have hereunder if the
Philadelphia Property Disposition did not occur and the Philadelphia Property
were included in the Partnership Properties held by the Partnership and the
Partnership Subsidiaries at the Closing. In the event of such election by
Buyer, (a) Buyer will indemnify the Seller Parties for any and all additional
costs resulting from the conveyance of the Philadelphia Property in the
Philadelphia Property Disposition and (b) Buyer shall be responsible for
obtaining at its sole cost any consent required by the holder of the Mortgage
Debt encumbering the Philadelphia Property to the Philadelphia Property
Disposition.

Partnership Property, the Seller Parties shall promptly so notify Buyer. Upon
Closing Buyer shall be entitled (a) in the event of a condemnation, to receive
the condemnation proceeds (as and when paid if after Closing), and (b) in the
event of a casualty, to receive the proceeds of insurance applicable thereto
(including, if applicable, any rent loss proceeds for the post-Closing
restoration period) and the Seller Parties shall give Buyer a credit (as a
dollar for dollar reduction in the Purchase Price) in the amount of any
deductible or coinsurance amount under the applicable Insurance Policies (but
not for any uninsured loss, unless the failure to maintain such insurance
constitutes a breach of the Seller Parties obligations under Section 2.17.
Any proceeds or awards paid to the Partnership or any Partnership Subsidiary
after the date hereof in connection with a casualty or condemnation shall not
be distributed to the Seller Parties, but the Partnership or applicable
Partnership Subsidiary shall be entitled to use any such proceeds or awards to
repair any damage done by such casualty or condemnation to the Partnership
Property. Buyer may participate in the negotiations regarding the settlement
of any claim for proceeds resulting from a casualty or condemnation and Seller
Parties will neither cause nor permit the Partnership or applicable
Partnership Subsidiary to settle any such claim

 



      
 

 



 

without obtaining Buyers prior written consent, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. In addition, the Seller Parties
agree that, without obtaining Buyers prior written consent, which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, neither the
Partnership nor any Partnership Subsidiary will make any repairs to, or
otherwise restore, the Partnership Property, other than repairs required to
protect the health or safety of any person or property at such Partnership
Property and except as required by the terms of any Ground Lease, Partnership
Space Lease or other agreement to which the Partnership or the applicable

 **5.19** ** ****_Tax Appeals. _**Refunds (net of the costs and expenses of
the appeal) relating to the appeal or contest of real estate taxes or assessed
valuations will be prorated between the Seller Parties and Buyer in a manner
consistent with the proration of the real estate taxes under this Agreement
for the applicable Partnership Property, subject to the rights of any tenants
thereto under the applicable Partnership Space Leases. The Seller Parties
agree that no action or proceeding contesting or appealing real estate taxes
or assessed valuations will be filed with respect to any of the Partnership
Properties following the date of this Agreement without Buyers prior written
consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).
Without first obtaining Buyers written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), the Seller Parties will not
cause or permit any Partnership Subsidiary to settle any pending appeal or
contest that would affect the assessed value or real estate taxes payable with
respect to any Partnership Property for any tax year for which Buyer is
responsible in whole or in part pursuant to the proration of the real estate
taxes under this Agreement for the applicable Partnership Property.

substantially similar to that provided for under the applicable lease; or
(iii) in the case of a so-called "national tenant", in the form customarily
used by such national tenant and (B) must not (i) allege the existence of any
default by the applicable Partnership Subsidiary landlord, (ii) allege any
unperformed obligation by the applicable Partnership Subsidiary landlord, or
(iii) disclose the existence of any delinquent fixed rent, additional rent or
other material charges payable by the relevant tenant, or other material
default by the relevant tenants, not disclosed on Schedule 2.9(d)-B of the
Seller Parties Disclosure Letter. The Seller Parties shall forward copies of
the executed estoppels to Buyer as and when received (including any received
after the minimum threshold has been met), provided, however, that the Seller
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have obtained and
delivered all of the requisite executed estoppel certificates for Buyers
review no later than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Any
estoppels meeting the requirements of the foregoing clause (B) shall be deemed
approved by Buyer upon receipt. To the extent any estoppel is received by
Buyer which does not meet the requirements of clause (B), unless Buyer gives
notice to the Seller Parties objecting to an executed estoppel certificate
within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such estoppel certificate,
Buyer shall be deemed to have approved such estoppel certificate (and the
closing on the Partnership Interest Purchase shall be subject to all matters
set forth in such estoppel certificate).

 



 

(f) Intentionally omitted.

 



 

(g) _Assignment and Transfer Agreements_. Buyer shall have received from each

assignment of the Partnership Interests and a "clean" estoppel from each
ground lessor under a Ground Lease. Buyer and the Seller parties shall
mutually and reasonably agree upon the form of each ground lessor estoppel
prior to the delivery thereof to the applicable ground lessor, such form to be
reasonable, customary and consistent with the requirements, if any, of the
Ground Lease.

 



 

(i) _Seller Party Closing Deliverables_. Buyer shall have received from the
applicable Seller Parties the documents and other deliverables set forth in

reasonably satisfactory to the Partnership that any affiliate of the

 **7.2** ** ****_Indemnification by the Seller Parties_**.

 



 

(a) The Seller Parties (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnifying Parties_ ")
agree, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, to
indemnify and defend Buyer and each of its Affiliates (including the
Partnership following the Closing), officers, directors, representatives and
agents (each, a " _Buyer Indemnified Party_ ") against and hold it harmless to
the extent of any and all losses, liabilities (including liabilities for
Taxes), damages (including diminution in value and loss of rental income),
claims, awards, judgments, costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys fees (collectively, " _Losses_ ") actually suffered or
incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party arising out of, in connection with or
resulting from (i) the breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller
Parties contained in Article II or expressly set forth in any document
delivered by the Seller Parties at or in connection with the Closing pursuant
to Section 6.2, (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Seller
Parties contained herein or in any document delivered by the Seller Parties at
or in connection with the Closing pursuant to Section 6.2, (iii) any
Liabilities of the Partnership or any Partnership Subsidiary arising or
accruing based on events occurring solely prior to Closing, (iv) except to the
extent already included as a Current Liability in the calculation of Closing
Adjusted Working Capital and without duplication, (A) any Taxes of the
Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries for any period before the Closing,
or (B) any liability of the Partnership or the Partnership Subsidiaries for
the Taxes of any Person (other than the Partnership or any Partnership
Subsidiary) by reason of being a transferee or successor to such Person or
otherwise by operation of law prior to the Closing; or (v) any uninsured
damage to, destruction or loss of any asset or property of the Partnership or
the Partnership Subsidiaries in excess of $50,000; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, in the case of either clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above no such
Loss shall be indemnified hereunder if and to the extent that the underlying
liability or claim also gave rise to a reduction in the Purchase Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.4 and provided, further, that in no event shall a Buyer
Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.2 more
than once for the same Loss arising from the same state of facts.

 



 

(b) The indemnification obligations of the Seller Indemnifying Parties
pursuant to Section 7.2(a) shall be limited as follows:

 



 

(i) The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall have no obligation to provide any
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a) until the aggregate dollar amount
of all Losses that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.2(a)
exceeds Three Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000.00), (the "
_Threshold Amount_ "), and then only to the extent such aggregate amount
exceeds such Threshold Amount.

 



 

(ii) The Seller Indemnifying Parties shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer
Indemnified Parties in the aggregate pursuant to Section 7.2(a) for any amount
of otherwise indemnifiable Losses with respect to such parties in excess of
Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) (the " _Partnership Maximum Amount_ ") or
from any source other than the Indemnification Escrow Amount.

 



 

(iii) No indemnification shall be payable to a Buyer Indemnified Party with
respect to claims first asserted by a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 7.2(a) after the date that is nine (9) months after the Closing Date
(the " _Indemnification Cut-Off Date_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Payments by the Seller Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 7.2(a)
shall be further reduced by any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by a Buyer Indemnified
Party from any third party with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) Buyer, on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Party, shall give the Seller
Parties written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of any claim, assertion, event
or proceeding by or in respect of a third party, or any other claim, as to
which the Buyer Indemnified Party may request indemnification hereunder as
soon as is practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days of the time
that the Buyer Indemnified Party learns of such claim, assertion, event or
proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to so notify the Seller
Parties shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder except to the
extent that the Seller Indemnifying Parties are actually prejudiced by such
failure. Such Claim Notice shall contain (A) a description and the amount to
the extent reasonably determinable (the " _Claimed Amount_ ") of any Losses
incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred, (B) a statement that it is
entitled to indemnification under this Article VII for such Losses and a
reasonable explanation of the basis therefor and (C) a demand for payment in
the amount of such Losses. Buyer, on behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Party, must
also deliver a copy of such Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent simultaneously
with delivery of the Claim Notice to the Seller Parties. Upon notice to Buyer
within twenty (20) days of receipt by Seller of a Claim Notice, the Seller
Parties shall have the right to direct, through counsel of their own choosing,
the defense or settlement of any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding by
or in respect of a third party. If the Seller Parties elect to assume the
defense of any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding, the Buyer
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense and in any event the Seller
Parties shall keep the Buyer Indemnified Party advised as to the status of
such suit or proceeding and defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Buyer Indemnified Party with respect thereto, but
in such case the expenses of the Buyer Indemnified Party shall be paid by the
Buyer Indemnified Party. A Buyer Indemnified Party shall provide and shall
cause the Partnership to provide, as applicable, the Seller Parties and
counsel with reasonable access to its records and personnel relating to any
such claim, assertion, event or proceeding during normal business hours and
shall otherwise cooperate with the Seller Parties in the defense or settlement
thereof and the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall reimburse the Buyer
Indemnified Party for all of the reasonable out of pocket expenses of such
Buyer Indemnified Party in connection therewith. Unless and until the Seller
Parties elects to defend or if, after commencing or undertaking any such
defense, the Seller Parties fail to prosecute or withdraws from such defense,
Buyer Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense or
settlement thereof, at the Seller Indemnifying Parties expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Buyer Indemnified Party, nor the
Seller Indemnifying Parties or the Seller Parties, shall make any settlement
or compromise of any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding without the
consent of the other (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Any settlement or compromise made or caused to be made by the Buyer
Indemnified Party or the Seller Indemnifying Parties or the Seller Parties, as
the case may be, of any such claim, assertion event, or proceeding shall also
be binding upon the Seller Indemnifying Parties and the Seller Parties or the
Buyer Indemnified Party, as the case may be, in the same manner as if a final
judgment or decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in
the amount of such settlement or compromise.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) A Buyer Indemnified Partys rights to indemnification or other remedies
hereunder based upon the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
of Seller will not be affected by any investigation or knowledge of the Buyer
Indemnified Party or any waiver by a Buyer Indemnified Party of any condition
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty or compliance with any
covenant or agreement. Such representations and warranties and covenants and
agreements shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of the fact that a
Buyer Indemnified Party knew or should have known that any representation or
warranty might be inaccurate or that the Seller Parties failed to comply with
any agreement or covenant. Any investigation by a Buyer Indemnified Party
shall be for its own protection only and shall not affect or impair any right
or remedy hereunder. A Buyer Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to
indemnification hereunder for any Loss arising from a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein (and the amount of any
Loss incurred in respect of such breach shall not be included in the
calculation of any limitations on indemnification set forth herein) to the
extent that such liability is disclosed as a current liability on the Post-
Closing Balance Sheet and is expressly taken into account for purposes of
determining the Closing Adjusted Working Capital and that resulting in an
adjustment to the Purchase Consideration as a result thereof.

 



 

(f) Within twenty (20) days after delivery of a Claim Notice by Buyer, on
behalf of a Buyer Indemnified Party, the Seller Parties shall deliver to Buyer
and the Escrow Agent a written response (the " _Response_ ") in which the
Seller Parties shall: (i) agree that the Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled
to receive all of the Claimed Amount (in which case, the Escrow Agent promptly
shall distribute to Buyer an amount of cash out of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, to the extent available, equal to the Claimed Amount), (ii) agree that
the Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the
Claimed Amount (the " _Agreed Amount_ ") (in which case, the Escrow Agent
shall distribute to Buyer an amount of cash out of the Indemnification Escrow
Amount, to the extent available, equal to the Agreed Amount) or (iii) dispute
that the Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claimed
Amount. If the Seller Parties do not deliver a Response to Buyer and Escrow
Agent with such 20 day period, the Seller Parties shall be deemed to have
agreed that the Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the
Claimed Amount. If, in the Response, the Seller Parties dispute their
liability for all or part of the Claimed Amount, the Seller Parties and the
Buyer Indemnified Party shall follow the procedures set forth below for the
resolution of such dispute (a " _Dispute_ "). During the fifteen (15) day
period following the delivery of a Response that reflects a Dispute, the
Seller Parties and the Buyer Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to
resolve the Dispute. If the Buyer Indemnified Party and the Seller Parties
should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared
and signed by both parties and furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum as joint instructions and
shall distribute the amount of cash specified in such memorandum out of the
Indemnification Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

(g) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give
rise to any right on the part of Buyer or a Buyer Indemnified Party, after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, to rescind this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) Neither the Partnership nor the Seller Indemnifying Parties shall have any
liability under any provision of this Agreement for any consequential (which
shall not be deemed to include loss of rents), exemplary or punitive damages
or any multiple of damages (except, in each case, as damages awarded to a
third party).

 



 

(i) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Indemnification Escrow
Amount shall serve as the sole and exclusive remedy for satisfaction of such
Seller Indemnifying Parties obligations pursuant to this Section 7.2.

 



 

 **7.3** ** ****_Indemnification by Buyer_**.

 



 

(a) Buyer agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement,
to indemnify the Seller Parties and each of its Affiliates, representatives
and agents and the officers and directors of the Partnership prior to the
Closing (each a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") against and hold them harmless
from all Losses actually suffered or incurred by such Seller Indemnified Party
arising out of, in connection with or resulting from (i) the breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer contained herein or in any document
delivered by Buyer at or in connection with the Closing pursuant to Section
6.3, or (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained herein
or in any document delivered by Buyer at or in connection with the Closing
pursuant to Section 6.3; _provided_ , _that_ in no event shall a Seller
Indemnified Party be entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.3 more
than once for the same Loss arising from the same state of facts.

 



 

(b) The indemnification obligations of Buyer pursuant to Section 7.3(a) or
otherwise in this Agreement shall not be effective until the aggregate dollar
amount of all Losses that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section
7.3(a) or otherwise in this Agreement exceeds the Threshold Amount, and then
only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds the Threshold Amount. Buyer
shall not be obligated to indemnify any Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to
Section 7.3(a) or otherwise in this Agreement for any amount of indemnifiable
Losses in excess of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000.00) (the " _Buyer Maximum
Amount_ "). No indemnification shall be payable to a Seller Indemnified Party
with respect to claims first asserted by such Seller Indemnified Party
pursuant to Section 7.3(a) after the Indemnification Cut Off Date.

 



 

(c) Payments by Buyer pursuant to Section 7.3(a) or otherwise in this
Agreement shall be reduced by any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment actually received by Partnership
Indemnified Parties with respect thereto.

 



 

(d) A Seller Indemnified Party shall give Buyer a Claim Notice of any claim,
assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect of a third party, or any other
claim, as to which such Seller Indemnified Party may request indemnification
hereunder as soon as is practicable and in any event within thirty (30) days
of the time that such Seller Indemnified Party learns of such claim,
assertion, event or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
so notify Buyer shall not affect rights to indemnification hereunder except to
the extent that Buyer is actually prejudiced by such failure. Upon notice to
the Seller Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days of receipt by Seller of a
Claim Notice, Buyer shall have the right to direct, through counsel of its own
choosing, the defense or settlement of any such claim, assertion, event or
proceeding by or

 



      
 

 



 

in respect of a third party. If Buyer elects to assume the defense of any such
claim, assertion, event or proceeding, (i) Buyer shall consult with the Seller
Indemnified Party, the Seller Indemnified Party may participate in such
defense, but in such case the expenses of the Seller Indemnified Party shall
be paid by the Seller Indemnified Party and (ii) Buyer shall be conclusively
deemed to have acknowledged that such claim, assertion, event or proceeding by
or in respect of a third party is within the scope of its indemnity
obligations under this Agreement. The Seller Indemnified Party and the Seller
Parties shall provide Buyer with reasonable access to its and its affiliates
records and personnel relating to any such claim, assertion, event or
proceeding during normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with
Buyer in the defense or settlement thereof, and Buyer shall reimburse the
Seller Indemnified Party for all the reasonable out of pocket expenses of such
Seller Indemnified Party in connection therewith. Unless and until Buyer
elects to defend or if, after commencing or undertaking any such defense,
Buyer fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense, the Seller
Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement
thereof, at Buyers expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Seller
Indemnified Party nor Buyer shall make any settlement or compromise of any
such claim, assertion, event or proceeding without the consent of the other
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any settlement or
compromise made or caused to be made by the Seller Indemnified Party or Buyer,
as the case may be, of any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding shall
also be binding upon Buyer or the Seller Indemnified Party, as the case may
be, in the same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a
court of competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or
compromise.

 



 

(e) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give
rise to any right on the part of the Seller Parties, after the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(f) Buyer shall not have any liability under any provision of this Agreement
for any consequential, exemplary or punitive damages or any multiple of
damages.

 



 

 **7.4** ** ****_Treatment of Indemnity Payments_**. All payments made by the
Seller Parties or Buyer, as the case may be, to or for the benefit of the
other parties pursuant to this Article VII shall be treated as adjustments to
the Purchase Consideration for tax purposes, and such agreed treatment shall
govern for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **7.5** ** ****_Remedies Exclusive_**.

 



 

(a) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that prior to the Closing, Buyer
shall have no right or remedy to take any action in respect of, and the Seller
Parties shall have no liability to Buyer in respect of, any breach by the
Seller Parties of any of their respective representations or warranties
contained herein or a failure to comply with any of their covenants,
conditions or agreements contained herein, except (i) to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 hereof, or (ii) seek specific performance or
injunctive relief.

 



 

(b) The Seller Parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that prior to the
Closing, the Seller Parties shall have no right or remedy to take any action
in respect of, and

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer shall have no liability to the Seller Parties in respect of, any breach
by Buyer of any of their respective representations or warranties contained
herein or a failure to comply with any of their covenants, conditions or
agreements contained herein, except to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1 hereof.

 



 

(c) From and after the Closing, the rights of the parties to indemnification
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
strictly limited to those contained in this Article VII or explicitly set
forth elsewhere in this Agreement, such indemnification rights shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of the parties and the Seller Parties subsequent
to the Closing Date with respect to any matter in any way relating to this
Agreement or arising in connection herewith other than specific performance
and injunctive relief. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the parties
hereby waive all other rights and remedies with respect to any matter in any
way relating to this Agreement or arising in connection herewith, whether
under any laws (including any right or remedy under the Resource Conservation
and Recovery Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 6901 et seq., the Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 9602
et seq., or any other Environmental Law), at common law or otherwise. Except
as provided in this Agreement, no claim, action or remedy shall be brought or
maintained by any party against any other party, and no recourse shall be
brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged
misstatement or omission respecting an inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations, warranties or covenants of any of the parties hereto set
forth or contained in this Agreement, except to the extent that the same shall
have been the result of fraud in the inducement by any party hereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, in no event shall any limit or
restriction on any rights or remedies set forth in this Agreement limit or
restrict the rights or remedies of any party for fraud by any other party
hereto.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE VIII - TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_**

 



 

 **8.1** ** ****_Termination_**. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to Closing:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and of the Seller Parties;

 



 

(b) by Buyer at any time prior to the Closing;

 



 

(c) by either Buyer or the Seller Parties, if any judgment, injunction, order,
decree, ruling or action by any Governmental Entity of competent authority
preventing the consummation of the Partnership Interest Purchase shall have
become final and non-appealable, _provided_ , _however_ , that the party
terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c) shall have used its
reasonable best efforts to have such judgment, injunction, order, decree,
ruling or action vacated;

 



 

(d) by either Buyer or the Seller Parties, if the Partnership Interest
Purchase shall not have been consummated before October 16, 2013 (subject to
extension by mutual agreement of Buyer and the Seller Parties, such agreement
in case of an extension to October 23, 2013 or a sooner date shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed by either party, the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may not terminate pursuant to this
clause (d) if the terminating party shall have breached in any material
respect its obligations

 



      
 

 



 

under this Agreement or is in breach of any representation or warranty
contained herein in any manner that shall have been the principal cause of the
inability of the parties to consummate the Partnership Interest Purchase or
resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur by the Termination date;

 



 

(e) by Buyer, upon a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
obligation or agreement on the part of the Seller Parties set forth in this
Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Seller Parties shall
have become untrue, in either case, such that the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b), as the case may be, would be incapable of
being satisfied by the Termination Date; or

 



 

(f) by the Seller Parties, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant obligation or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement (including without limitation failure to have sufficient financing
when all other conditions in Article VI have been satisfied or waived or to
the extent applicable susceptible of being satisfied), or if any
representation or warranty of Buyer shall become untrue, in either case, such
that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b), as the case
may be, would be incapable of being satisfied by the Termination Date.

 



 

 **8.2** ** ****_Effect of Termination_**.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Seller Parties
or Buyer pursuant to Section 8.1, this Agreement shall immediately become void
and have no effect, without any liability or obligation on Buyer or the Seller
Parties, except (i) if the Agreement is terminated (A) pursuant to Section
8.1(d) (by either party) at a time when both (x) conditions to Closing set
forth in Section 6.3 (excluding Section 6.3(c)) have been satisfied or waived
(or would be satisfied if the Closing were held) and (y) the conditions to
Closing set forth in Section 6.2 have not been satisfied or waived, or (B)
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or 8.1(e), then the Buyer shall be entitled to
receive the Signing Deposit (including interest or other income therefrom)

Section 5.2, this Section 8.2 and Article IX shall survive any termination of
this Agreement and (iii) for fraud. The payment of the Signing Deposit to the
Seller Parties pursuant to the foregoing sentence above is a condition to the
Seller Parties willingness to enter into this Agreement and represents
liquidated damages intended to reimburse the Seller Parties for incurring the
damages, costs and expenses related to entering into this Agreement, is not a
penalty and is in lieu of any other rights or remedies under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 8.2(a),
unless Cabot Industrial Value Fund III, Inc. (the " _Fund Subsidiary REIT_ ")
shall have received a tax opinion of counsel or a ruling from the IRS to the
effect that the Fund Subsidiary REITs receipt of its share of the Signing
Deposit will be treated as qualifying income with respect to the Fund
Subsidiary REIT for purposes of Section 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or
shall be excluded from income for such purposes (a " _Positive Tax Opinion or
Ruling_ "), the aggregate amount of the Signing Bonus deemed paid to the
Seller Parties shall be limited to the maximum amount (" _Allowed Signing
Deposit_ ") that can be paid without causing the Fund Subsidiary REITs
receipt of its pro rata share of such funds to cause the Fund Subsidiary REIT
to fail to

 



      
 

 



 

meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, determined as
if the payment of such amount did not constitute qualifying income for such
purposes, as determined by independent accountants to the Partnership or the
Fund Subsidiary REIT, which determination shall be provided to Buyer. In the
event that the Signing Deposit exceeds the Allowed Signing Deposit, then such
excess amount (the " _Escrowed Deposit_ ") shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement in a separate interest-bearing,
segregated account for the account of Buyer. The Seller Parties shall pay all
costs associated with obtaining any tax opinion of counsel or ruling from the
IRS described above. The Escrowed Deposit shall be fully disbursed (and
therefore any unpaid portion of the Signing Deposit shall be paid to the
Seller Parties pro rata) upon receipt of a Positive Tax Opinion or Ruling. To
the extent not previously paid, upon any determination by independent
accountants to the Partnership or the Fund Subsidiary REIT that any additional
amount of the Signing Deposit may be disbursed (to the Seller Parties pro
rata) without causing the Fund Subsidiary REIT to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code, determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute qualifying income for such
purposes, the determination of such independent accountants shall be provided
to the Escrow Agent and such additional amount shall be disbursed (and
therefore such portion of the Signing Deposit shall be paid to the Seller
Parties pro rata). At the end of the second calendar year beginning after the
Closing Date (or earlier if directed by the Partnership or the Fund Subsidiary
REIT), any remainder of the Escrowed Deposit (together with interest thereon)
then being held by the Escrow Agent shall be disbursed to Buyer and, in the
event that the Signing Deposit has not by then been paid in full, such unpaid
portion of the Signing Deposit shall be deemed forgiven. The Seller Parties
shall bear any and all expenses associated with the escrow of the Escrowed
Deposit. Each of the Seller Parties is hereby granted the power of attorney on
behalf of Buyer to execute, acknowledge, swear to and deliver all such
documents required in connection with the foregoing escrow account, such power
to be irrevocable and coupled with an interest.

 



 

 **8.3** ** ****_Amendment_**. This Agreement may be amended by the parties in
writing by action of Buyer and the Seller Parties at any time prior to
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that there shall be no amendment to Sections
8.3, 8.4, 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7 (or any provision of this Agreement to the extent
an amendment of such provision would modify the substance of Sections 8.3,
8.4, 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7) in a manner that would be adverse to the Financing
Parties without the prior written consent of the Financing Parties.

 



 

 **8.4** ** ****_Extension; Waiver_**. At any time prior to the Closing,
Buyer, on one hand, and the Seller Parties, on the other hand, may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other party, or (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or waive compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions of the other party contained in this Agreement,
except that there shall be no waiver to Sections 8.3, 8.4, 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7
(or any provision of this Agreement to the extent a waiver of such provision
would modify the substance of Sections 8.3, 8.4, 9.5, 9.6 and 9.7) in a manner
that would be adverse to the Financing Parties without the prior written
consent of the Financing Parties. Any agreement on the part of a party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. Waiver of any term or condition of
this Agreement by a party shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach or waiver of the same term or condition by such party, or a waiver of
any other term or condition of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement by such party. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE IX - GENERAL PROVISIONS_**

 



 

 **9.1** ** ****_Nonsurvival of Representations and Warranties_**. Except as
expressly provided for in Article VII of this Agreement, none of the
representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing. This Section
9.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties that by its terms
contemplates performance after the Closing.

 



 

 **9.2** ** ****_Notices_**. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other
communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered
personally, sent by overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) to the

 **9.5** ** ****_Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_**. This
Agreement, the Seller Parties Disclosure Letter, the Buyer Disclosure Letter,
the Confidentiality Agreement and the other agreements entered into in
connection with the Partnership Interest Purchase and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral among
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and (b)
except (i) as provided in Section 5.7 (Indemnification), (ii) the provisions
set forth in Section 8.3 (Amendment), Section 8.4 (Extension; Waiver), Section
9.5 (Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries), Section 9.6 (Governing
Law; Consent to Jurisdiction), and Section 9.7 (Waiver of Jury Trial), the
benefit of which shall inure to the benefit of the Financing Parties who in
each case are expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries hereof, and
(iii) the provisions of Article I or of any agreement governing the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement concerning the payment of
consideration (the benefit of which shall inure to the benefit of those
parties entitled to such consideration under the applicable agreement, who are
in each case expressly intended to be third-party beneficiaries hereof and
thereof) (collectively, " _Third Party Provisions_ "), are not intended to
confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement. The Third Party Provisions may be enforced by the
beneficiaries thereof or on behalf of the beneficiaries thereof by the Seller
Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, each Seller Party and the
Partnership (each on behalf of itself and its respective affiliates and its
and their respective holders of partnership interests, stockholders,
directors, officers, representatives or agents) (i) hereby waives any and all
rights or claims it or any of them may have against any Financing Parties
(whether based in contract, tort, fraud, strict liability, other laws or
otherwise) arising under or in connection with, this Agreement, the Financing,
the Financing Agreements or the Financing Letters or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby and (ii) hereby agrees that no Financing Party
shall have any liability or obligations of any kind (whether based in
contract, tort, fraud, strict liability, other laws or otherwise) to any
Seller Party, the Partnership, any of their respective affiliates or any of
its or their respective stockholders, directors, officers, representatives or
agents arising under or in connection with, this Agreement, the Financing, the
Financing Agreements or the Financing Letters or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt,
this provision shall not be construed to limit Buyers or any of its
Affiliates (including the Partnership following the Closing) rights under any
agreement with the Financing Parties.

 



 

 **9.6** ** ****_Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_**. THIS AGREEMENT
WILL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE INTERNAL LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER
APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS. EACH OF BUYER AND THE SELLER
PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CONSENTS TO SUBMIT TO THE SOLE
AND EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE AND OF THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE (THE " _DELAWARE
COURTS_ ") FOR ANY LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO

 



      
 

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE NEGOTIATION, VALIDITY OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT,
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (AND AGREES NOT TO COMMENCE ANY
LITIGATION RELATING THERETO EXCEPT IN SUCH COURTS), WAIVES AN OBJECTION TO THE
LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUCH LITIGATION IN THE DELAWARE COURTS AND AGREES NOT
TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY DELAWARE COURT THAT SUCH LITIGATION BROUGHT THEREIN
HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO AGREES
(A) TO THE EXTENT SUCH PARTY IS NOT OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO SERVICE OF PROCESS IN
THE STATE OF DELAWARE, TO APPOINT AND MAINTAIN AN AGENT IN THE STATE OF
DELAWARE AS SUCH PARTYS AGENT FOR ACCEPTANCE OF LEGAL PROCESS, AND (B) THAT
SERVICE OF PROCESS MAY ALSO BE MADE ON SUCH PARTY BY PREPAID CERTIFIED MAIL
WITH A PROOF OF MAILING RECEIPT VALIDATED BY THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE
CONSTITUTING EVIDENCE OF VALID SERVICE. SERVICE MADE PURSUANT TO (A) OR (B)
ABOVE SHALL HAVE THE SAME LEGAL FORCE AND EFFECT AS IF SERVED UPON SUCH PARTY
PERSONALLY WITHIN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NO
PARTY HERETO, NOR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, WILL BRING OR SUPPORT THE BRINGING
OF, ANY CLAIM, WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR
OTHERWISE, AGAINST ANY FINANCING PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY
DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE FINANCING, THE FINANCING
AGREEMENTS OR THE FINANCING LETTERS OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, ANYWHERE OTHER
THAN IN (I) ANY NEW YORK STATE COURT SITTING IN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK OR (II)
THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

 



 

 **9.7** ** ****_Waiver of Jury Trial_**. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE
PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING (INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM) RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE FINANCING, THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS OR THE
FINANCING LETTERS OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF.

 



 

 **9.8** ** ****_Assignment_**. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated,
in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties
hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 



 

 **9.9** ** ****_Specific Enforcement_**.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.2, any and all remedies
expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement shall be cumulative with,
and not exclusive of, any other remedy contained in this Agreement, at law or
in equity and the exercise by a party to this Agreement of any one remedy
shall not preclude the exercise by it of any other remedy.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage, for which
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by the Seller Parties in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, Buyer will be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement
(without, in each case, the posting of a bond or other security) in any court
of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the parties obligations under Section 5.2 (Confidentiality) or Section
5.8 (Financing) are not performed by one or more of the parties hereto in
accordance with the terms hereof or were otherwise breached and that Buyer and
the Seller Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms and
provisions of such Sections or an injunction to prevent any breach of such
sections, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.

 



 

 **9.10** ** ****_Severability_**. Any term or provision of this Agreement
which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

 



 

 **9.11** ** ****_Expenses_**. Except as otherwise specified in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the
Closing shall have occurred.

 



 

(a) _Title Insurance and Surveys_. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall
pay all fees, costs and other expenses to obtain any of the following items to
the extent desired by Buyer or required by any lender of the Mortgage Debt or
any other lender to Buyer or any of its affiliates: updated title searches,
reports or title insurance commitments; the Owners Title Policies and any
policies or date-down endorsements or other endorsements to existing title
owners or lenders title insurance policies of any lenders on the Mortgage
Debt; updated surveys or amendments or endorsements to existing surveys, and
similar items with respect to title and survey matters affecting the
Partnership Properties.

 



 

(b) _Transfer Taxes and Recording Fees_. In the event that any real estate
recording fees or Transfer Taxes become payable as a result of the Partnership
Interest Purchase, the Seller Parties and Buyer will each pay one-half of any
such recording fees or Transfer Taxes. Each party shall cooperate in the
preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications
or other documents regarding any taxes or fees described in this Section
9.9(b). " _Transfer Taxes_ " shall mean any and all taxes, fees, charges or
costs imposed by state, county or local authorities on the direct or indirect
transfer of title to or beneficial interest in real property

 



      
 

 



 

regardless of whether referred to as a tax or otherwise, including, without
limitation, any taxes caused by any transfer of controlling interests in a
Partnership Subsidiary or Affiliate following the original vesting of title of
any Partnership Property in such Partnership Subsidiary or Affiliate.

 



 

(c) _Loan Assumption Fees_. At or prior to the Closing, Buyer will pay Loan
Assumption Feeds and the lender legal fees and other reimbursements as
provided in Section 5.10.

 



 

(d) _Escrow Fees_. The Seller Parties and Buyer will each pay one-half of any
escrow closing fees in connection with the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 **EXHIBIT A**

 



 

 **DEPOSIT ESCROW AGREEMENT**

 



      
 

 



 

 **DEPOSIT ESCROW AGREEMENT**

 



 

This DEPOSIT ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of the 31st
day of July, 2013, by and among Liberty Property Limited Partnership, a
Pennsylvania limited partnership (" _Buyer_ "), Cabot Industrial Value Fund
III Manager, Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts limited partnership (the "
_LP Seller_"), Cabot Industrial Value Fund III, Inc., a Maryland corporation
(" _General Partner_ " and together with the LP Seller, the " _Escrow
Participants_ "), and U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking
association (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), as escrow agent. The Buyer, LP Seller
and General Partner are sometimes referred to herein, collectively, as the "
_Interested Parties_."

 



 

WHEREAS, the Buyer, LP Seller and General Partner have entered into a
Partnership Interest Transfer Agreement dated July 31, 2013 (the " _Purchase
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which LP Seller and General Partner will, subject to
the terms and conditions therein, sell all of their limited partnership
interests and general partnership interests in Cabot Industrial Value Fund III
Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware Limited Partnership (the "
_Partnership_ ") to Buyer (the " _Partnership Interest Sale_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 1.5 of the Purchase Agreement, Buyer shall
deposit $25,000,000.00 in cash into escrow to be retained by the Escrow Agent
until the earlier to occur of (i) the consummation of the Partnership Interest
Sale, and (ii) the termination of the Purchase Agreement, in accordance with
the procedures set forth herein; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Interested Parties wish to engage the Escrow Agent to act, and
the Escrow Agent is willing to act, as escrow agent hereunder and, in that
capacity, to hold, administer and distribute the amounts deposited in escrow
hereunder in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of this Agreement;

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt whereof is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

 ** _Section 1._** ** _ _****_Definitions_** ** _._**

 



 

" _Business Day_ " means each day, other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day
on which banks in Hartford, Connecticut are required by law to close.

 



 

 ** _Section 2._** ** _ _****_Deposit of Escrow Funds_** **.**

 



 

Within one (1) Business Day after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Buyer shall deposit with the Escrow Agent in immediately available
funds the amount of $25,000,000 (the " _Escrow Funds_ ", and together with any
investment income or proceeds received by the Escrow Agent from the investment
thereof from time to time pursuant to Section 4 below, collectively, the "
_Escrow Property_ ") and the Escrow Agent agrees to hold the Escrow Property
in an account established with the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ "),
and to administer the Escrow Property in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Section 3._** ** _ _****_Claims and Payment; Release from Escrow_** **
_._**

 



 

(a) _General_. Subject to Section 3(b) and Section 6 below, Escrow Agent
shall, at any time, distribute all or such part of the Escrow Property as
directed by and in accordance with the terms of (i) a Joint Written Direction
(as defined below), or (ii) a final, non-appealable written order of a court
of competent jurisdiction, a copy of which is delivered by Buyer or the Escrow
Participants to Escrow Agent at least two (2) business days prior to such
distribution. Escrow Agent shall consider any such written order submitted
pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence to be a final, non-
appealable written order or decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, and
shall not be under any obligation to make further inquiry. As used in this
Agreement, a " _Joint Written Direction_ " shall mean a written direction
executed by each of Buyer and the Escrow Participants and directing Escrow
Agent to disburse all or a portion of the Escrow Property or to take or
refrain from taking an action pursuant to this Agreement. Any Joint Written
Direction directing the disbursement of all or any portion of the Escrow
Property shall contain wiring instructions or an address to which a check
shall be sent.

 



 

(b) _Termination Notice_. Each of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Escrow
Participants, on the other hand, agree that, in the event that such party (a "
_Terminating Party_ ") delivers a notice to the other party/parties
terminating the Purchase Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 of the Purchase
Agreement, the Terminating Party will simultaneously deliver a copy of such
notice to the Escrow Agent, which notice shall specify the provision of the
Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the Terminating Party is terminating the
Purchase Agreement. If the non-Terminating Party delivers a written notice to
the Terminating Party and the Escrow Agent objecting to the provision upon
which the Purchase Agreement was terminated and specifying with reasonable
particularity its basis therefor which is received by the Escrow Agent within
10 business days (an " _Objection Notice_ ") of the Escrow Agents receipt of
the termination notice, then the Escrow Property shall be retained in the
Escrow Account and distributed by Escrow Agent only in accordance with the
terms of Section 3(a) above and Section 6. If the non-Terminating Party does
not timely deliver an Objection Notice, then if, as specified in the
termination notice, (i) the Purchase Agreement is terminated (A) pursuant to
Section 8.1(d) of the Purchase Agreement at a time when both (x) conditions to
the closing of the Partnership Interest Sale set forth in Section 6.3 of the
Purchase Agreement (excluding Section 6.3(c)) have been satisfied or waived
(or would be satisfied if the closing of the Partnership Interest Sale were
held) and (y) the conditions to closing of the Partnership Interest Sale set
forth in Section 6.2 of the Purchase Agreement have not been satisfied or
waived or (B) pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or 8.1(e), then Escrow Agent shall
release to the Buyer, within two (2) business days after the end of such 10
business day period, the Escrow Property and (ii) the Purchase Agreement is
terminated in any other manner, Escrow Agent shall release to the Escrow
Participants, subject to Section 6, within two (2) business days after the end
of such 10 business day period, the Escrow Property, on a pro rata basis in
accordance with their respective percentage interests set forth on _Exhibit
C_.

 



 

(c) _Termination Date_. Each of the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Escrow
Participants, on the other hand, agree that, in the event that no party
delivers a notice terminating the Purchase Agreement as set forth in Section
3.1(c) above prior to October 16, 2013 (subject to extension pursuant to the
terms of the Purchase Agreement, the " _Termination Date_ "), subject to
Section 6, Escrow Agent shall release to the Escrow Participants, within two
(2) business days thereafter,

 



      
 

 



 

the Escrow Property, on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective
percentage interests set forth on _Exhibit C_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Termination Date may be extended by mutual agreement of the Interested
Parties and delivery of joint written notice to the Escrow Agent of such
extension. Buyer and the Escrow Participants agree that any notice extending
the Termination Date pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will be delivered to
the Escrow Agent concurrently.

 



 

 ** _Section 4._** ** ****_Investment of Funds_** **.**

 



 

(a) _General_. If the Escrow Agent shall have received specific joint written
investment instruction from Buyer, LP Seller and General Partner (which shall
include instruction as to term to maturity, if applicable), on a timely basis,
the Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Property in Eligible Investments,
pursuant to and as directed in such instruction.

 



 

(b) " _Eligible Investments_." shall mean (i) obligations issued or guaranteed
by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof
(provided that the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged in
support thereof); (ii) shares of a money market fund that is subject to
regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.,
and complies with the requirements of Rule 2a-7 thereof, (iii) deposit
accounts or certificates of deposit of any domestic commercial bank having
capital and surplus in excess of $500,000,000, which, in the case of
certificates of deposit, are negotiable and have a ready secondary market;
(iv) investment in the Escrow Agents " _Money Market Deposit Account_ " ("
_MMDA_ "), as described in Annex A hereto. If otherwise qualified, obligations
of the Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates shall qualify as Eligible
Investments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Eligible Investments shall be
limited to those instruments readily obtainable and routinely offered by the
Escrow Agents Corporate Trust Services.

 



 

(c) _Escrow Agent Not Responsible For Investment Decisions_ _. _Absent its
timely receipt of such specific joint written investment instruction from
Buyer, LP Seller and General Partner, the Escrow Agent shall have no
obligation or duty to invest (or otherwise pay interest on) the Escrow
Property; provided, however, that in the event the Escrow Agent shall not have
received such written investment instruction, the Escrow Agent shall be
authorized to invest any of the Escrow Property in the Escrow Agents MMDA
until such investment instruction is received. All earnings received from the
investment of the Escrow Property shall be credited to, and shall become a
part of, the Escrow Property (and any losses on such investments shall be
debited to the Escrow Account). Subject to Section 7(b) of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any investment losses, including
without limitation any market loss on any investment liquidated prior to
maturity in order to make a payment required hereunder.

 



 

(d) _Transaction Confirmations_. The parties hereto acknowledge that, to the
extent regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, or other applicable
regulatory entity, grant the parties the right to receive individual
confirmations of security transactions at no additional cost, as they occur,
the parties specifically waive receipt of such confirmations to the extent
permitted by law. The Escrow Agent will furnish the parties hereto with
periodic cash transaction statements that include detail for all investment
transactions made by the Escrow Agent hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Section 5._** ** ****_Tax Reporting_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) The Interested Parties agree that, unless otherwise specified in this
Agreement, any investment income earned (or proceeds received), prior to the
disbursement of the Escrow Property, during a calendar year period from the
investment of the Escrow Property, shall be treated consistently with the
terms of Section 1.5(c) of the Purchase Agreement and shall be reported on an
annual basis by the Escrow Agent (and the Escrow Agent agrees to so report
such income) on the appropriate Form 1099 (or Form 1042-S), as required
pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (" _Code_ ") and the regulations
thereunder as having been earned by the Buyer.

 



 

(b) The Interested Parties are responsible for making an affirmative
communication to the Escrow Agent if the securities being exchanged, redeemed,
or sold are classified as " _Covered Securities_ " or " _Non-Covered
Securities_ " under the Internal Revenue Service Cost Basis Reporting
regulations. If such securities are classified as " _Covered Securities_ ",
the parties are jointly responsible for providing the required information to
the Escrow Agent for sending accurate and complete Form 1099-B information to
the Escrow Participants. The required information shall be each Escrow
Participants date of acquisition and each Escrow Participants cost basis of
the applicable security, and any such other information that the Escrow Agent
may request to be in compliance with the IRS 1099-B reporting regulations
under the Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
view the securities being exchanged, redeemed or sold pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement as "Non-Covered Securities. The information shall be provided timely
to the Escrow Agent so it can meet its obligations to send Form 1099-B
information to the Escrow Participants and the IRS by the applicable reporting
deadlines.

 



 

(c) General Partner is responsible for providing guidance to the Escrow Agent
on the appropriate allocation of the cost basis to each Escrow Participants
distribution. The Escrow Agent shall rely upon such guidance to perform the
required tax reporting for distributions made from the Escrow Accounts.

 



 

(d) _Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number_. Each of the Interested
Parties hereto agrees to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax
identification number by signing and returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8 BEN, in
case of non-U.S. persons) to the Escrow Agent upon the execution and delivery
of this Agreement. The Interested Parties understand that, in the event their
tax identification numbers are not certified to the Escrow Agent, the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended from time to time, may require withholding of a
portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow
Property. The Interested Parties also agree to provide the Escrow Agent with
all documentation necessary for the Escrow Agent to comply with the Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act. Each of the Interested Parties agrees to instruct
the Escrow Agent in writing with respect to the Escrow Agents responsibility
for withholding and other taxes, assessments or other governmental charges,
and to instruct the Escrow Agent with respect to any certifications and
governmental reporting that may be required under any laws or regulations that
may be applicable in connection with its acting as Escrow Agent under this
Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Section 6._** ** **_Certain Conditions_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, unless the General Partner shall have received a
tax opinion of counsel or a ruling from the IRS to the effect that the General
Partners receipt of its share of the Escrow Property will be treated as
qualifying income with respect to the General Partner for purposes of Section
856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3) of the Code or shall be excluded from income for such
purposes (a " _Positive Tax Opinion or Ruling_ "), the aggregate amount of the
Escrow Property to be paid or distributed to the Escrow Participants pursuant
to this Agreement shall be limited to the maximum amount (" _Allowed Escrow
Property_ ") that can be paid without causing the General Partners receipt of
its pro rata share of such funds to cause the General Partner to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute qualifying income for such
purposes, as determined by independent accountants to the Escrow Participants,
which determination shall be provided to Buyer and to the Escrow Agent at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the applicable date on which the Escrow
Agent is required to make a distribution of Escrow Property. In the event that
the Escrow Property exceeds the Allowed Escrow Property, then such excess
amount (the " _Escrowed Deposit_ ") shall be retained by the Escrow Agent in a
separate interest-bearing, segregated account for the account of Buyer. The
Escrow Participants shall pay all costs associated with obtaining any tax
opinion of counsel or ruling from the IRS described above. The Escrowed
Deposit shall be fully disbursed (and therefore any unpaid portion of the
Escrow Property shall be paid to the Escrow Participants pro rata) upon
receipt of a Positive Tax Opinion or Ruling. To the extent not previously
paid, upon any determination by independent accountants to the Escrow
Participants that any additional amount of the Escrow Property may be
disbursed (to the Escrow Participants pro rata) without causing the General
Partner to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and 856(c)(3)
of the Code, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
qualifying income for such purposes, the determination of such independent
accountants shall be provided to the Escrow Agent and such additional amount
shall be disbursed at least two (2) Business Days prior to the applicable date
on which the Escrow Agent is required to make a distribution of Escrow
Property (and therefore such portion of the Escrow Property shall be paid to
the Escrow Participants pro rata). At the end of the second calendar year
beginning after the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) (or
earlier if directed by the General Partner or the LP Seller), any remainder of
the Escrowed Deposit (together with interest thereon) then being held by the
Escrow Agent shall be disbursed to Buyer and, in the event that the Escrow
Property has not by then been paid in full, such unpaid portion of the Escrow
Property shall be deemed forgiven. The Escrow Participants shall bear any and
all expenses associated with the escrow of the Escrowed Deposit. The Escrow
Participants are hereby granted the power of attorney on behalf of Buyer to
execute, acknowledge, swear to and deliver all such documents required in
connection with the foregoing escrow account, such power to be irrevocable and
coupled with an interest. The parties intend for this Section 6 to be
interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with Section 8.2(b) of the
Purchase Agreement and to the extent of any inconsistencies between the two
provisions, the terms of the Purchase Agreement shall control.

 



 

 ** _Section 7._** ** _ _****_Concerning the Escrow Agent_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) Each Interested Party acknowledges and agrees that the Escrow Agent (i)
shall not be responsible for any of the agreements referred to or described
herein (including without limitation the Purchase Agreement), or for
determining or compelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be
bound thereby, (ii) shall be obligated only for the performance of such

 



      
 

 



 

duties as are expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement on its
part to be performed, each of which is ministerial (and shall not be construed
to be fiduciary) in nature, and no implied duties or obligations of any kind
shall be read into this Agreement against or on the part of the Escrow Agent,
(iii) shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder which
might in its judgment involve or cause it to incur any expense or liability
unless it shall have been furnished with acceptable indemnification, (iv) may
rely on and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any
written notice, instruction (including, without limitation, wire transfer
instructions, whether incorporated herein or provided in a separate written
instruction), instrument, statement, certificate, request or other document
furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper person, and shall have no responsibility or
duty to make inquiry as to or to determine the genuineness, accuracy or
validity thereof (or any signature appearing thereon), or of the authority of
the person signing or presenting the same, and (v) may consult counsel
satisfactory to it, including in-house counsel, and the opinion or advice of
such counsel in any instance shall be full and complete authorization and
protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with the opinion or advice of such counsel.

 



 

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to anyone for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it hereunder except in the case of the Escrow Agents
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be
liable for indirect, punitive, special or consequential damage or loss
(including but not limited to lost profits) whatsoever, even if the Escrow
Agent has been informed of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action.

 



 

(c) The Escrow Agent shall have no more or less responsibility or liability on
account of any action or omission of any book-entry depository, securities
intermediary or other subescrow agent employed by the Escrow Agent than any
such book-entry depository, securities intermediary or other subescrow agent
has to the Escrow Agent, except to the extent that such action or omission of
any book-entry depository, securities intermediary or other subescrow agent
was caused by the Escrow Agents own gross negligence or willful misconduct in
breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any
investment permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual
capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or such
affiliate is acting as a subagent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person
or dealing as principal for its own account.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any term appearing in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no instance shall the Escrow Agent be required or obligated to distribute any
Escrow Property (or take other action that may be called for hereunder to be
taken by the Escrow Agent) sooner than two (2) Business Days after (i) it has
received the applicable documents required under this Agreement in good form,
or (ii) passage of the applicable time period (or both, as applicable under
the terms of this Agreement), as the case may be _._

 



 

(f) Unless and except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein, all
deposits and payments hereunder, or pursuant to the terms hereof (including
without limitation all payments to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 8 _,_
shall be in U.S. dollars.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Section 8._** ** ****_Compensation, Expense Reimbursement and
Indemnification_** **.**

 



 

(a) Each of the Interested Parties agrees, jointly and severally (i) to pay or
reimburse the Escrow Agent for its attorneys fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation of this Agreement and (ii) to pay the Escrow
Agents compensation for its normal services hereunder in accordance with the
fee schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and made a part hereof, which may
be subject to change hereafter by the Escrow Agent on an annual basis.

 



 

(b) Each of the Interested Parties agrees, jointly and severally, to reimburse
the Escrow Agent on demand for all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the administration of this Agreement or the escrow created hereby or the
performance or observance of its duties hereunder which are in excess of its
compensation for normal services hereunder, including without limitation,
payment of any legal fees and expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in
connection with resolution of any claim by any party hereunder.

 



 

(c) Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees, jointly and
severally, to indemnify the Escrow Agent (and its directors, officers and
employees) and hold it (and such directors, officers and employees) harmless
from and against any loss, liability, damage, cost and expense of any nature
incurred by the Escrow Agent arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or with the administration of its duties hereunder, including but
not limited to reasonable attorneys fees, tax liabilities (other than tax
liabilities associated with the Escrow Agents fees or reimbursements), any
liabilities or damages that may result from any inaccuracy or
misrepresentation made in any tax certification provided to the Escrow Agent,
and other costs and expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any
claim of liability unless and except to the extent such loss, liability,
damage, cost and expense shall be caused by the Escrow Agents gross
negligence, or willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification and agreement
to hold harmless shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Escrow Agent shall
have and is hereby granted a possessory lien on and security interest in the
Escrow Property, and all proceeds thereof, to secure payment of all amounts
owing to it from time to time hereunder, whether now existing or hereafter
arising. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to deduct from the Escrow
Property, and proceeds thereof, any such sums, upon one Business Days notice
to the Interested Parties of its intent to do so.

 



 

(e) Without altering or limiting the joint and several liability of any of the
Interested Parties to the Escrow Agent hereunder, each of the Interested

the mutual written agreement of the parties involved or by a final order,
decree or judgment of a court in the United States of America, the time for
perfection of an appeal of such order, decree or judgment having expired. The
Escrow Agent may, but shall be under no duty whatsoever to, institute or
defend any legal proceedings which relate to the Escrow Property.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT

 



 

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions (which includes
the Escrow Agent) to obtain, verify and record information that identifies
each person who opens an account.

 



 

For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or
other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its
formation and existence as a legal entity. Such documentation may include, but
is not limited to, Certificates of Good Standing from the appropriate
Secretary of State, certified copies of Partnership Agreements, Trust
Agreements or other formation agreements or documents. For companies whose
equity securities are publicly traded, these requirements can be met with
evidence of regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as
found on their EDGAR database. We may also ask to see financial statements,
licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming
authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation.

 



 

In addition, for non-individual entities, the Escrow Agent must be informed if
any contractual party is now acting, or has acted in the past 12 months, under
a different name, or has changed its name in the last 12 months.

 



 

For individuals, a copy of a governmentissued identification, such as a
drivers license or passport, is required to establish identity for the
primary party responsible for the account, such as the Shareholder
Representative, as a signing party to the governing documents. Additionally,
any individual involved in the transaction will be required to provide a
certified Tax Identification Number on IRS Form W-9, or Form W-8 for non-US
Persons.

 



 

Any capitalized term used without definition in this _Exhibit B_ is used with
the meaning assigned to such term in the Escrow Agreement of which this
_Exhibit B_ is a part.

 **POST-CLOSING ESCROW AGREEMENT**

 



 

This POST-CLOSING ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of the

Limited Partnership, a Pennsylvania limited partnership (" _Buyer_ "), Cabot
Industrial Value Fund III Manager, Limited Partnership, a Massachusetts
limited partnership (the " _LP Seller_"), Cabot Industrial Value Fund III,
Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _General Partner_ " and together with the LP

Buyer, LP Seller and General Partner are sometimes referred to herein,
collectively, as the " _Interested Parties_."

 



 

WHEREAS, the Buyer, LP Seller and General Partner have entered into a
Partnership Interest Transfer Agreement dated July 31, 2013 (the " _Purchase
Agreement_ ") pursuant to which LP Seller and General Partner have sold sell
all of their limited partnership interests and general partnership interests
in Cabot Industrial Value Fund III Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware
Limited Partnership (the " _Partnership_ ") to Buyer;

 



 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, a portion of the purchase price
is to be withheld and placed into two separate escrow accounts as follows: (i)
$3,000,000 as a source of the payment for any adjustments that may arise
pursuant to Section 1.4 of the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) $10,000,000 as a
source for any indemnified claims that may arise pursuant to Section 7.2 of
the Purchase Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, on July 31, 2013, the Buyer, LP Seller and General Partner entered
into a Deposit Escrow Agreement (the " _Deposit Escrow Agreement_ ") with the
Escrow Agent, pursuant to which $25,000,000 (the " _Initial Deposit_ ") was
deposited with the Escrow Agent subject to the terms and conditions of the
Deposit Escrow Agreement;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Interested Parties desire that, pursuant to the terms of the
Deposit Escrow Agreement, a portion of the Initial Deposit will be applied to
fund the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund (as defined below) and the
Indemnification Escrow Fund in lieu of being released to the Escrow
Participants upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Interested Parties wish to engage the Escrow Agent to act, and
the Escrow Agent is willing to act, as escrow agent hereunder and, in that
capacity, to hold, administer and distribute the amounts deposited in escrow
hereunder in accordance with, and subject to, the terms of this Agreement;

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, for valuable consideration, the receipt whereof is hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Section 1._** ** _ _****_Definitions_** **.**

 



 

" _Business Day_ " means each day, other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day
on which banks in Hartford, Connecticut are required by law to close.

 



 

 ** _Section 2._** ** _ _****_Deposit of Escrow Funds_** **.**

 



 

Simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Escrow Agent
shall, in compliance with the Deposit Escrow Agreement, cause the aggregate
amount of $13,000,000 (the " _Escrow Funds_ ", and together with any
investment income or proceeds received by the Escrow Agent from the investment
thereof from time to time pursuant to Section 4 below, collectively, the "
_Escrow Property_ ") to be released from the escrow established pursuant to
the Deposit Escrow Agreement and deposited in immediately available funds in
two separate escrow accounts as follows: (i) $3,000,000 as a source of the
payment for any adjustments that may arise pursuant to Section 1.4 of the
Purchase Agreement that result in additional payments to the Buyer (together
with any investment income or proceeds received by the Escrow Agent from the
investment thereof, the " _Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund_ "), and (ii)
$10,000,000 as a source for any indemnified claims that may arise pursuant to
Section 7.2 of the Purchase Agreement (together with any investment income or
proceeds received by the Escrow Agent from the investment thereof, the "
_Indemnification Escrow Fund_ "). The Escrow Agent agrees to hold the Escrow
Property in these two accounts established with the Escrow Agent (each, an "
_Escrow Account_ " and together, the " _Escrow Accounts_ "), and to administer
the Escrow Property in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

 ** _Section 3._** ** _ _****_Claims and Payment; Release from Escrow_** **.**

 



 

(a) _General_. Subject to Section 3(b)(3) and Section 3(c)(2) below, Escrow
Agent shall, at any time, distribute all or such part of the Escrow Property
as directed by and in accordance with the terms of (i) a Joint Written
Direction (as defined below), or (ii) a final, non-appealable written order of
a court of competent jurisdiction, a copy of which is delivered by Buyer or
the Escrow Participants to Escrow Agent at least two (2) business days prior
to such distribution. Escrow Agent shall consider any such written order
submitted pursuant to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence to be a final,
non-appealable written order or decision of a court of competent jurisdiction,
and shall not be under any obligation to make further inquiry. As used in this
Agreement, a " _Joint Written Direction_ " shall mean a written direction
executed by each of Buyer and the Escrow Participants and directing Escrow
Agent to disburse all or a portion of the Escrow Property or to take or
refrain from taking an action pursuant to this Agreement. Any Joint Written
Direction directing the disbursement of all or any portion of the Escrow
Property shall contain wiring instructions or an address to which a check
shall be sent and identify the Escrow Fund from which the monies are to be
withdrawn.

 



 

(b) _Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund_.

 



 

(1) If, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.4 of the Purchase
Agreement, it is determined that Buyer is entitled to receive a payment in
order to satisfy any adjustment required thereby, Buyer and the Escrow
Participants shall provide a Joint Written Direction to Escrow Agent
indicating that Buyer is entitled to all or a portion of

 



      
 

 



 

the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund. In such Joint Written Direction,
Buyer and the Escrow Participants shall specify the amount that Buyer is
entitled to receive under the terms of the Purchase Agreement (the " _Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount_ ") and direct Escrow Agent to distribute to Buyer
that portion of the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund equal to the
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, together with any interest or other income
on such portion through the date of disbursement, and the remainder of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund (if any), together with any interest or
other income thereon through the date of disbursement, shall be distributed by
Escrow Agent to the Escrow Participants pro rata in accordance with their
respective percentage interests set forth on _Exhibit C_ attached hereto
(their " _Percentage Interests_ ").

 



 

(2) If, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1.4 of the Purchase
Agreement, it is determined that Buyer is not entitled to receive a payment in
order to satisfy any adjustment required thereby, Buyer and the Escrow
Participants shall provide a Joint Written Direction to Escrow Agent directing
that the Purchase Price Adjustment Escrow Fund, together with any interest or
other income thereon through the date of disbursement, be distributed by
Escrow Agent to the Escrow Participants pro rata in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests.

 



 

(c) _Indemnification Escrow Fund_.

 



 

(1) From and after the date of this Agreement until the nine-month anniversary
of the date hereof (the " ** _Initial Release Date_** "), Buyer may make
claims against the Indemnification Escrow Fund as set forth in this Section
3(c). Buyer shall, simultaneously with delivery of a Claim Notice to the
Escrow Participants pursuant to Section 7.2 of the Purchase Agreement, provide
such Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent indicating that it is entitled to all or
any portion of the Indemnification Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of
Section 7.2 of the Purchase Agreement. The Claim Notice shall set forth the
_Claim Amount_ (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Unless the Escrow
Participants provide a written response to Escrow Agent, which written
response is received by Escrow Agent within fifteen (15) days after Escrow
Agents receipt of the Claim Notice, in which the Escrow Participants object
to all or any portion of the Claim Amount, Escrow Agent shall pay to Buyer,
within two (2) business days after the end of such fifteen (15) day period
(or, if the Escrow Participants affirmatively notify the Escrow Agent that
they have no objection to the Claim Amount, within two (2) business days after
the date on which the Escrow Agent receives such notice), that portion of the
Indemnification Escrow Fund which is equal to the Claim Amount, together with
any interest or other income thereon through the date of disbursement. If
within such fifteen (15) day period, the Escrow Agent receives from the Escrow
Participants written notice that they object to any portion of Buyers claim,
the Escrow Participants written response shall specify the reason(s), in
reasonable detail, for the objection and the portion, if any, of the Claim
Amount which is accepted. If any portion of the Claim Amount is expressly
accepted by the Escrow Participants, Escrow Agent shall pay to Buyer, within
two (2) business days after Escrow Agents receipt of the Escrow Participants
written response, that portion of the Indemnification Escrow Fund which is
equal to the portion of the Claim Amount expressly accepted by the Escrow
Participants, together with any interest or other income thereon through the
date of disbursement. The

 



      
 

 



 

portion of any Claim Amount objected to by the Escrow Participants in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement (the " _Disputed Amount_ ") shall
be retained in the Indemnification Escrow Fund and distributed by Escrow Agent
only in accordance with the terms of Section 3(a) above. The Escrow
Participants shall simultaneously deliver to Buyer a copy of any written
response to a Claim Notice that it provides to the Escrow Agent under this
Section 3(c)(i), and the Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility to
determine if a copy of such written response was delivered to or received by
Buyer. The Escrow Agent may rely conclusively on any Claim Notice or response
thereto or letter of instruction it receives hereunder and it will be presumed
that any such notice satisfies the conditions set forth herein. Furthermore,
the Escrow Agent shall not have responsibility to determine if a Claim Notice
or a response thereto satisfies the conditions set forth in the Purchase
Agreement for making a claim, including whether there is a basis for making a
claim, whether the claim is set forth in sufficient detail, or that a copy of
the Claim Notice was sent to or received by the Escrow Participants.

 



 

(2) Not later than the third (3rd) business day following the Initial Release
Date, Escrow Agent shall distribute to the Escrow Participants pro rata in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests (i) the remaining
balance of the Indemnification Escrow Fund, if any, less (ii) an amount
sufficient to cover all outstanding and unpaid Claim Amounts that are subject
to Claim Notices made on or prior to the Initial Release Date (whether
disputed or undisputed and including any Disputed Amounts) (the " _Outstanding
Claims_ ") in accordance with this Agreement, and less (iii) any interest or
other income on the Claim Amounts for such Outstanding Claims. If the amount
to be distributed to the Escrow Participants pursuant to this Section 3(c)(ii)
is reduced as a result of any Outstanding Claims, then all related Claim
Amounts and interest or other income thereon that remains in the
Indemnification Escrow shall be disbursed by Escrow Agent after the Initial
Release Date in accordance with Section 3(a) or 3(b)(i) above, together with
any interest or other income thereon through the date of disbursement.

 



 

(j) _Strict Compliance_. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Property in
escrow strictly in accordance with this Agreement and shall make payments from
the Escrow Property only in accordance with, and only to the extent permitted
under, this Section 3.

 



 

 ** _Section 4._** ** _ _****_Investment of Funds_** **.**

 



 

(a) _General_. If the Escrow Agent shall have received specific joint written
investment instruction from Buyer, LP Seller and General Partner (which shall
include instruction as to term to maturity, if applicable), on a timely basis,
the Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Property in Eligible Investments,
pursuant to and as directed in such instruction.

 



 

(b) " _Eligible Investments_." shall mean (i) obligations issued or guaranteed
by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof
(provided that the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged in
support thereof); (ii) shares of a money market fund that is subject to
regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq.,
and complies with the requirements of Rule 2a-7 thereof, (iii) deposit
accounts or certificates of deposit of any domestic commercial bank having
capital and surplus in excess of $500,000,000, which, in the case of
certificates of deposit, are negotiable and have a ready secondary market;

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) investment in the Escrow Agents " _Money Market Deposit Account_ " ("
_MMDA_ "), as described in Annex A hereto. If otherwise qualified, obligations
of the Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates shall qualify as Eligible
Investments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Eligible Investments shall be
limited to those instruments readily obtainable and routinely offered by the
Escrow Agents Corporate Trust Services.

 



 

(c) _Escrow Agent Not Responsible For Investment Decisions_ _. _Absent its
timely receipt of such specific joint written investment instruction from
Buyer, LP Seller and General Partner, the Escrow Agent shall have no
obligation or duty to invest (or otherwise pay interest on) the Escrow
Property; provided, however, that in the event the Escrow Agent shall not have
received such written investment instruction, the Escrow Agent shall be
authorized to invest any of the Escrow Property in the Escrow Agents MMDA
until such investment instruction is received. All earnings received from the
investment of the Escrow Property shall be credited to, and shall become a
part of, the Escrow Property (and any losses on such investments shall be
debited to the Escrow Account). Subject to Section 7(b), the Escrow Agent
shall have no liability for any investment losses, including without
limitation any market loss on any investment liquidated prior to maturity in
order to make a payment required hereunder.

 



 

(d) _Transaction Confirmations_. The parties hereto acknowledge that, to the
extent regulations of the Comptroller of the Currency, or other applicable
regulatory entity, grant the parties the right to receive individual
confirmations of security transactions at no additional cost, as they occur,
the parties specifically waive receipt of such confirmations to the extent
permitted by law. The Escrow Agent will furnish the parties hereto with
periodic cash transaction statements that include detail for all investment
transactions made by the Escrow Agent hereunder.

 



 

 ** _Section 5._** ** _ _****_Tax Reporting_** ** _._**

 



 

(a) The Interested Parties agree that, unless otherwise specified in this
Agreement, any investment income earned (or proceeds received), prior to the
disbursement of the Escrow Property, during a calendar year period from the
investment of the Escrow Property, shall be treated consistently with the
terms of Section 1.5(c) of the Purchase Agreement and shall be reported on an
annual basis by the Escrow Agent (and the Escrow Agent agrees to so report
such income) on the appropriate Form 1099 (or Form 1042-S), as required
pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (" ** _Code_** ") and the
regulations thereunder as having been earned by Buyer.

 



 

(b) The Interested Parties are responsible for making an affirmative
communication to the Escrow Agent if the securities being exchanged, redeemed,
or sold are classified as " _Covered Securities_ " or " _Non-Covered
Securities_ " under the Internal Revenue Service Cost Basis Reporting
regulations. If such securities are classified as " _Covered Securities_ ",
the parties are jointly responsible for providing the required information to
the Escrow Agent for sending accurate and complete Form 1099-B information to
the Escrow Participants. The required information shall be each Escrow
Participants date of acquisition and each Escrow Participants cost basis of
the applicable security, and any such other information that the Escrow Agent
may request to be in compliance with the IRS 1099-B reporting regulations
under the Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties
view the securities being exchanged,

 



      
 

 



 

redeemed or sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement as "Non-Covered
Securities." The information shall be provided timely to the Escrow Agent so
it can meet its obligations to send Form 1099-B information to the Escrow
Participants and the IRS by the applicable reporting deadlines.

 



 

(c) General Partner is responsible for providing guidance to the Escrow Agent
on the appropriate allocation of the cost basis to each Escrow Participants
distribution. The Escrow Agent shall rely upon such guidance to perform the
required tax reporting for distributions made from the Escrow Accounts.

 



 

(d) _Certification of Taxpayer Identification Number_. Each of the Interested
Parties hereto agrees to provide the Escrow Agent with a certified tax
identification number by signing and returning a Form W-9 (or Form W-8 BEN, in
case of non-U.S. persons) to the Escrow Agent upon the execution and delivery
of this Agreement. The Interested Parties understand that, in the event their
tax identification numbers are not certified to the Escrow Agent, the Internal
Revenue Code, as amended from time to time, may require withholding of a
portion of any interest or other income earned on the investment of the Escrow
Property. The Interested Parties also agree to provide the Escrow Agent with
all documentation necessary for the Escrow Agent to comply with the Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act. Each of the Interested Parties agrees to instruct
the Escrow Agent in writing with respect to the Escrow Agents responsibility
for withholding and other taxes, assessments or other governmental charges,
and to instruct the Escrow Agent with respect to any certifications and
governmental reporting that may be required under any laws or regulations that
may be applicable in connection with its acting as Escrow Agent under this
Agreement.

 



 

 ** _Section 6._** ** _ _****_Intentionally Omitted_** **.**

 



 

 ** _Section 7._** ** _ _****_Concerning the Escrow Agent_** **.**

 



 

(a) Each Interested Party acknowledges and agrees that the Escrow Agent (i)
shall not be responsible for any of the agreements referred to or described
herein (including without limitation the Purchase Agreement), or for
determining or compelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be
bound thereby, (ii) shall be obligated only for the performance of such duties
as are expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement on its part to
be performed, each of which is ministerial (and shall not be construed to be
fiduciary) in nature, and no implied duties or obligations of any kind shall
be read into this Agreement against or on the part of the Escrow Agent, (iii)
shall not be obligated to take any legal or other action hereunder which might
in its judgment involve or cause it to incur any expense or liability unless
it shall have been furnished with acceptable indemnification, (iv) may rely on
and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any written
notice, instruction (including, without limitation, wire transfer
instructions, whether incorporated herein or provided in a separate written
instruction), instrument, statement, certificate, request or other document
furnished to it hereunder and believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper person, and shall have no responsibility or
duty to make inquiry as to or to determine the genuineness, accuracy or
validity thereof (or any signature appearing thereon), or of the authority of
the person signing or presenting the same, and (v) may consult counsel
satisfactory to it, including in-house counsel, and the opinion or advice of
such counsel in any instance shall be full and complete authorization

 



      
 

 



 

and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it
hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion or advice of such
counsel.

 



 

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to anyone for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it hereunder except in the case of the Escrow Agents
gross negligence or willful misconduct. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be
liable for indirect, punitive, special or consequential damage or loss
(including but not limited to lost profits) whatsoever, even if the Escrow
Agent has been informed of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action.

 



 

(c) The Escrow Agent shall have no more or less responsibility or liability on
account of any action or omission of any book-entry depository, securities
intermediary or other subescrow agent employed by the Escrow Agent than any
such book-entry depository, securities intermediary or other subescrow agent
has to the Escrow Agent, except to the extent that such action or omission of
any book-entry depository, securities intermediary or other subescrow agent
was caused by the Escrow Agents own gross negligence or willful misconduct in
breach of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized, in making or disposing of any
investment permitted by this Agreement, to deal with itself (in its individual
capacity) or with any one or more of its affiliates, whether it or such
affiliate is acting as a subagent of the Escrow Agent or for any third person
or dealing as principal for its own account.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any term appearing in this Agreement to the contrary, in
no instance shall the Escrow Agent be required or obligated to distribute any
Escrow Property (or take other action that may be called for hereunder to be
taken by the Escrow Agent) sooner than two (2) Business Days after (i) it has
received the applicable documents required under this Agreement in good form,
or (ii) passage of the applicable time period (or both, as applicable under
the terms of this Agreement), as the case may be _._

 



 

(f) Unless and except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein, all
deposits and payments hereunder, or pursuant to the terms hereof (including
without limitation all payments to the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 8 _,_
shall be in U.S. dollars.

 



 

 ** _Section 8._** ** _Compensation, Expense Reimbursement and
Indemnification_.**

 



 

(a) Each of the Interested Parties agrees, jointly and severally (i) to pay or
reimburse the Escrow Agent for its attorneys fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation of this Agreement and (ii) to pay the Escrow
Agents compensation for its normal services hereunder in accordance with the
fee schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ and made a part hereof, which may
be subject to change hereafter by the Escrow Agent on an annual basis.

 



 

(b) Each of the Interested Parties agrees, jointly and severally, to reimburse
the Escrow Agent on demand for all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the administration of this Agreement or the escrow created hereby or the
performance or observance of its duties hereunder which are in excess of its
compensation for normal services hereunder, including without limitation,
payment of any legal fees and expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in
connection with resolution of any claim by any party hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each of the Interested Parties covenants and agrees, jointly and
severally, to indemnify the Escrow Agent (and its directors, officers and
employees) and hold it (and such directors, officers and employees) harmless
from and against any loss, liability, damage, cost and expense of any nature
incurred by the Escrow Agent arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement or with the administration of its duties hereunder, including but
not limited to reasonable attorneys fees, tax liabilities (other than tax
liabilities associated with the Escrow Agents fees and reimbursements), any
liabilities or damages that may result from any inaccuracy or
misrepresentation made in any tax certification provided to the Escrow Agent,
and other costs and expenses of defending or preparing to defend against any
claim of liability unless and except to the extent such loss, liability,
damage, cost and expense shall be caused by the Escrow Agents gross
negligence, or willful misconduct. The foregoing indemnification and agreement
to hold harmless shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Escrow Agent shall
have and is hereby granted a possessory lien on and security interest in the
Escrow Property, and all proceeds thereof, to secure payment of all amounts
owing to it from time to time hereunder, whether now existing or hereafter
arising. The Escrow Agent shall have the right to deduct from the Escrow
Property, and proceeds thereof, any such sums, upon one Business Days notice
to the Interested Parties of its intent to do so.

 



 

(e) Without altering or limiting the joint and several liability of any of the
Interested Parties to the Escrow Agent hereunder, each of the Interested
Parties agrees as among themselves that they shall share, each, all amounts
payable to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 7 on the following basis:
(x) 50% by the Buyer, and (y) 50% by the Escrow Participants.

 



 

 ** _Section 9._** ** ****_Resignation_** **.**

 



 

The Escrow Agent may at any time resign as Escrow Agent hereunder by giving
thirty (30) days prior written notice of resignation to Buyer and the Escrow
Participants. Prior to the effective date of the resignation as specified in
such notice, Buyer, and the Escrow Participants will jointly issue to the
Escrow Agent a written instruction authorizing redelivery of the Escrow
Property to a bank or trust company that they select as successor to the
Escrow Agent hereunder. If, however, Buyer and the Escrow Participants shall
fail to name such a successor escrow agent within twenty (20) days after the
notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent may apply to a
court of competent jurisdiction for appointment of a successor escrow agent.

 



 

 ** _Section 10._** ** ****_Dispute Resolution_** **.**

 



 

It is understood and agreed that, should any dispute arise with respect to the
delivery, ownership, right of possession, and/or disposition of the Escrow
Property, or should any claim be made upon the Escrow Agent or the Escrow
Property by a third party, the Escrow Agent upon receipt of notice of such
dispute or claim is authorized and shall be entitled (at its sole option and
election) to retain in its possession without liability to anyone, all or any
of the Escrow Property until such dispute shall have been settled either by
the mutual written agreement of the parties involved or by a final order,
decree or judgment of a court in the United States of America, the time for
perfection of an appeal of such order, decree or judgment having expired. The
Escrow

 



      
 

 



 

Agent may, but shall be under no duty whatsoever to, institute or defend any
legal proceedings which relate to the Escrow Property.

 



 

 ** _Section 11._** ** ****_Consent to Jurisdiction and Service_** **.**

 



 

Each of the Interested Parties hereby absolutely and irrevocably consents and
submits to the jurisdiction of the courts in the State of Connecticut and of

ITS PROVISIONS OR ANY NEGOTIATIONS IN CONNECTION HEREWITH.**

 



 

 ** _ _Section 13.__** ** _ _****_Force Majeure_** ** _._**

performance resulting from acts beyond its control. Such acts shall include

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT

 



 

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions (which includes
the Escrow Agent) to obtain, verify and record information that identifies
each person who opens an account.

 



 

For a non-individual person such as a business entity, a charity, a trust or
other legal entity the Escrow Agent will ask for documentation to verify its
formation and existence as a legal entity. Such documentation may include, but
is not limited to, Certificates of Good Standing from the appropriate
Secretary of State, certified copies of Partnership Agreements, Trust
Agreements or other formation agreements or documents. For companies whose
equity securities are publicly traded, these requirements can be met with
evidence of regulatory filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as
found on their EDGAR database. We may also ask to see financial statements,
licenses, identification and authorization documents from individuals claiming
authority to represent the entity or other relevant documentation.

 



 

In addition, for non-individual entities, the Escrow Agent must be informed if
any contractual party is now acting, or has acted in the past 12 months, under
a different name, or has changed its name in the last 12 months.

 



 

For individuals, a copy of a governmentissued identification, such as a
drivers license or passport, is required to establish identity for the
primary party responsible for the account, such as the Shareholder
Representative, as a signing party to the governing documents. Additionally,
any individual involved in the transaction will be required to provide a
certified Tax Identification Number on IRS Form W-9, or Form W-8 for non-US
Persons.

 



 

Any capitalized term used without definition in this _Exhibit B_ is used with
the meaning assigned to such term in the Escrow Agreement of which this
_Exhibit B_ is a part.

U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

 

MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNT

 

DESCRIPTION AND TERMS

 



 

The U.S. Bank Money Market account is a U.S. Bank National Association ("
_U.S. Bank_ ") interest-bearing money market deposit account designed to meet
the needs of U.S. Banks Corporate Trust Services Escrow Group and other
Corporate Trust customers of U.S. Bank. Selection of this investment includes
authorization to place funds on deposit with U.S. Bank.

 



 

U.S. Bank uses the daily balance method to calculate interest on this account
(actual/365 or 366). This method applies a daily periodic rate to the
principal balance in the account each day. Interest is accrued daily and
credited monthly to the account. Interest rates are determined at U.S. Banks
discretion, and may be tiered by customer deposit amount.

 



 

The owner of the account is U.S. Bank as Agent for its trust customers. U.S.
