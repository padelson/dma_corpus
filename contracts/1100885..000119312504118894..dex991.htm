AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (the " _Agreement_ "), dated as of July 15, 2004,
by and among Digitas Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Buyer_ "), Digitas
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Buyer (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Modem Media, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Seller_ ").



WHEREAS, the boards of directors of each of the Buyer, Merger Sub and the
Seller have declared that it is advisable and in the best interests of their
respective stockholders to consummate, and have approved this Agreement and
the transactions provided for herein, pursuant to which, subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Seller (the " _Merger_ ");



WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the Buyers willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the Buyer and each member of the Sellers board of directors and
certain executive officers of the Seller are entering into stockholder voting
agreements dated as of the date hereof (the " _Buyer s Stockholder Voting
Agreements_"); and



WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
condition and inducement to the Sellers willingness to enter into this
Agreement, the Seller and each member of the Buyers board of directors and
certain executive officers of the Buyer are entering into stockholder voting
agreements dated as of the date hereof (the " _Seller s Stockholder Voting
Agreements_"); and



WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties and
agreements in connection with the Merger and to prescribe certain conditions
to the Merger;



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:



ARTICLE I - THE MERGER



1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), at the
Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Seller. The Seller
shall be the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") in the
Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State
of Delaware. Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall terminate.



1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") that shall be filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on or before the Closing
Date. The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when the
Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Certificate of Merger. 1.3 _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, on a date (the " _Closing Date_ ") and at a place to be specified
by the parties, which shall be no later than five (5) business days after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the latest to occur of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that
relate to action to be taken at the Closing), unless extended by mutual
agreement of the parties.



1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.



1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. __ The Certificate of
Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation,
until thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable
law. The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended as provided therein and in accordance with applicable law.



1.6 _Directors and Officers_. The directors and officers of the Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the directors and
officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. In addition, Joseph R. Zimmel (or, if he is not available
to serve, another individual who is reasonably acceptable to the Buyer) shall
be appointed and become a member of the board of directors of the Buyer
effective immediately following the Effective Time, with a term expiring in
2007 and otherwise to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Buyer.



1.7 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of
Section 368 of the Code.



ARTICLE II - EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE SELLER CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF
SHARES



2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Seller or capital stock of Merger Sub:



(a) _Capital Stock of the Merger Sub_. All shares of common stock of the
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become an aggregate number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation equal to the number of shares of Seller Common Stock and
Seller Stock Options issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. 



(b) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. All shares of common stock, $0.001 par
value per share, of the Seller, (" _Seller Common Stock_ "), that are owned by
any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Seller and any shares of Seller Common
Stock owned by the Buyer, the Merger



 

2 Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no stock of
the Buyer or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Seller Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2, each share of
Seller Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 0.70 fully paid and
nonassessable shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of common stock, $0.01 par
value per share, of the Buyer (the " _Buyer Common Stock,_ " and such shares,
the " _Merger Consideration_ ") upon surrender of the certificate representing
such share of Seller Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.2. As
of the Effective Time, all such shares of Seller Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of
Seller Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to this
Section 2.1(c) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, without interest, upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2.



(d) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. In the event of any reclassification,
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Buyer Common Stock or Seller
Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with
respect to Buyer Common Stock or Seller Common Stock occurring (or for which a
record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time, the Exchange Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted to reflect fully
such event.



(e) _Seller Stock Options_.



(i) At the Effective Time, each Seller Stock Option (other than the Seller UK
Stock Options) that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto
shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Seller Common Stock and
shall be converted automatically into an option to purchase shares of Buyer
Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined as provided in
this Section 2.1(e) (and otherwise subject to the terms of the Seller Stock
Option Plans (other than the Seller UK Sub-plan) and the agreements evidencing
grants thereunder) (a " _Buyer Assumed Option_ "). The number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock to be subject to each Buyer Assumed Option shall be equal
to the product of (i) the number of shares of Seller Common Stock subject to
such Seller Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the Exchange Ratio; provided that any fractional shares resulting from such
multiplication shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The exercise
price per share of Buyer Common Stock under each Buyer Assumed Option shall be
equal to (y) the exercise price per share of Seller Common Stock at which
such Seller Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time divided by (z) the Exchange Ratio; provided that such exercise price
shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
each Seller Stock Option which is an "incentive stock option" shall be
adjusted as required by Section 424 of the Code, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, so as not to constitute a modification, extension or
renewal of the option within the meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code.



 

3 (ii) An offer by the Buyer will be made to holders of options granted under
the Seller UK Sub-plan (" _Seller UK Stock Options_ ") to have such Seller UK
Stock Options converted in accordance with the terms of Section 2.1(e)(i) (the
" _Rollover Offer_ "). The terms of the Rollover Offer will be agreed
(if possible) with the UK Inland Revenue in order to preserve the tax
advantages of the Seller UK Sub-plan. The Rollover Offer will be made either
prior to the Effective Time and conditional upon consummation of the Merger
(provided that the making of such Rollover Offer prior to the Effective Time
can be made without breaching the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) or
shortly after the Effective Time. UK Seller Stock Options held by holders who
accept the Rollover Offer will be converted into options to acquire shares of
Buyer Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined in
accordance with section 2.1(e)(i) and such options shall be subject always to
the terms of the Seller UK Sub-plan and the agreements evidencing grants
thereunder, either at the Effective Time or shortly after the Effective Time
depending on when the Rollover Offer is made. The Certificate of Incorporation
and/or Bylaws of the Merger Sub shall provide that to the extent that any
holders of Seller UK Stock Options do not accept the Rollover Offer, the
Buyer shall have a call option to acquire any shares of the capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation which such holders may acquire on any exercise of
such Seller UK Stock Options; it being understood that the terms of the call
option shall permit the Buyer to acquire capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation in exchange for Buyer Common Stock at the Exchange Ratio.



(iii) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deliver
to the participants in the Seller Stock Plans (other than the Seller ESPP and
the Seller UK Sub-plan) appropriate notice setting forth such participants
rights pursuant thereto. All grants made pursuant to the Seller Stock Plans
(other than the Seller ESPP and the Seller UK Sub-plan) shall continue in
effect on the same terms and conditions (other than as set forth in the
provisions of this Section 2.1(e)).



(iv) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Buyer Assumed Options
(for the avoidance of doubt, including any Buyer Assumed Options which were,
prior to their conversion, Seller UK Stock Options). As soon as practicable
after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall file a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor form) with respect to the shares of Buyer Common
Stock subject to such Buyer Assumed Options and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or
registration statements with respect to the shares underlying such Buyer
Assumed Options that are eligible for registration on Form S-8 (and maintain
the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for
so long as such Buyer Assumed Options remain outstanding.



 

4 (f) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Companys 1999 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _Seller ESPP_ "), shall be terminated as of the last business day
prior to the Effective Time (the " _ESPP Termination Date_ "), and each
participant in the Seller ESPP on the ESPP Termination Date shall be deemed to
have exercised his or her option under the Seller ESPP on the ESPP
Termination Date and shall acquire from the Seller (i) such number of whole
shares of Seller Common Stock as the accumulated payroll deductions credited
to his or her account as of the ESPP Termination Date will purchase at the
price specified in the Seller Stock Purchase Plan (treating the ESPP
Termination Date as the New Exercise Date (as defined in the Seller ESPP) for
all purposes of the ESPP) and (ii) cash in the amount of any remaining
balance in such participants account; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
participant who has given notice to the Seller before the third business day
prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the Seller ESPP that
such participant requests the distribution of the accumulated payroll
deductions credited to his or her account in cash shall receive cash in the
amount of the balance in such participants account in lieu of purchasing
Seller Common Stock thereunder.



2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Seller Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:



(a) _Exchange Agent_. As of the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit with
American Stock Transfer and Trust Company or another bank or trust company
designated by the Buyer and acceptable to the Seller (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Seller Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2, through the Exchange Agent, (i)
certificates representing that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock
equal to the aggregate number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to
make payments for fractional shares required pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and
(iii) any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Seller
Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c). The shares of Buyer
Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to clause (i) above,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto with a
record date after the Effective Time, and the cash deposited pursuant to
clause (ii) above are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") whose shares were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) into the right to
receive shares of Buyer Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the
Buyer may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for shares of Buyer Common Stock
(plus cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, of Buyer Common Stock and any
dividends or distributions as provided below). Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as
may be appointed by the Buyer, together



 

5 with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (A) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Buyer Common Stock
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (B)
cash in an amount sufficient to make payments for fractional shares pursuant
to the provisions of Section 2.2(e) and (C) any dividends or distributions
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Seller Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Seller, (x) a certificate representing the proper number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (y) the
proper amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e)
and (z) any dividends or distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(c) may be
issued or paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate
so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender (1) shares of Buyer Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(c), (2) cash in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and (3) any dividends or distributions pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) as contemplated by this Section 2.2.



(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.2(e)
shall be paid to any such holder until the holder of record of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws (including abandoned property and escheat laws), following
surrender of any such Certificate there shall be issued and paid to the record
holder of the Certificate, (i) certificates representing whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, (ii) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of
Buyer Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time previously paid with respect to such whole shares of
Buyer Common Stock, without interest, and (iii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date
subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Buyer
Common Stock.



(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Seller Stock_. All shares of Buyer Common
Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance
with the terms hereof (together with any cash or dividends or other
distributions paid pursuant to Sections 2.2(c) or 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to
have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such shares of Seller Common Stock, and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Seller Common Stock which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this Article II.



 

6 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a stockholder of the Buyer.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Seller Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates registered in the name of or
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to such fractional part of a share of Buyer
Common Stock multiplied by the volume weighted average trading price of a
share of Buyer Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") on
the trading day immediately preceding the Effective Time.



(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Seller Common Stock 180 days
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and,
subject to Section 2.2(g), any holder of Seller Common Stock who has not
previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to the
Buyer for payment of its claim for shares of Buyer Common Stock, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and any dividends or distributions paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c). __



(g) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the
Buyer, the Merger Sub, the Seller, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Seller Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to two years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any shares of Buyer Common Stock, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.2(e) or any
dividends or distributions payable to the holder of such Certificate pursuant
to Section 2.2(c), would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity), all such shares of Buyer Common Stock, cash in lieu of

(viii) with any of the Sellers customers among the ten customers generating
the highest revenues during the four fiscal quarters prior to the date hereof
under which services remain to be performed by the Seller or its Subsidiaries
(excluding statements of work). The Seller has previously made available to
the Buyer complete and accurate copies of each contract, arrangement,
commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section 4.15
(collectively referred to herein as the " _Seller Contracts_ "), subject to
reasonable procedures established by the Seller to keep such information
confidential. All of the Seller Contracts are valid and in full force and
effect, except to the extent they have expired in accordance with their terms
or if the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Seller. Neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has, and to the
knowledge of the Seller, none of the other parties thereto have, violated any
provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act, and no event or
condition exists, which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would
constitute a default under the provisions of, any Seller Contract, except in
each case for those violations and defaults which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Seller.



 

36 4.16 _Properties_.



(a) Neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any real
property. Section 4.16(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule lists all real
property leased or subleased to or by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
and lists the dates of and parties to each such lease, the dates and parties
to each amendment, modification and supplement to each lease, any extension
and expansion options, and the current rent payable thereunder as of the date
hereof. The Seller has made available to the Seller true, complete and
accurate copies of the leases and subleases (each as amended to date) listed
in Section 4.16(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. With respect to each
such lease and sublease, except as set forth in Section 4.16(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule:



(i) the lease or sublease is a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of
the Seller or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, subject to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating to
creditors rights and general principles of equity;



(ii) neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of
the Seller, any other party, is in material breach or violation of, or
material default under, any such lease or sublease, and no event has occurred,
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Seller, is threatened, which, after
the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material breach or default by the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the
knowledge of the Seller, any other party under such lease or sublease;



(iii) except for the subleases set forth in Section 4.16(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries has
assigned, transferred, conveyed, mortgaged, deeded in trust or encumbered in
any material respect any interest in the leasehold or subleasehold; and



(iv) there are no Encumbrances, easements, covenants or other restrictions
applicable to the real property subject to such lease or sublease, except for
recorded easements, covenants and other restrictions which do not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the current uses or the
occupancy by the Seller or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, of the
property subject thereto.



(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.16(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
the Seller and its Subsidiaries own good title, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, to all property and physical assets necessary to conduct the
business of the Seller as currently conducted, except for (i) Encumbrances
reflected in the Seller Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the
Seller SEC Reports, (ii) Encumbrances or imperfections of title which do
not materially detract from the value or interfere with the present or
presently contemplated use of the assets subject thereto or affected thereby,
(iii) Encumbrances for current Taxes not yet due and payable and (iv)
Encumbrances on the landlords interest in the premises. Except as would not
be material to the business of the Seller, the Seller and its Subsidiaries, as
lessees, have the right under valid and subsisting leases to use, possess and
control all personalty leased by the Seller or



 

37 its Subsidiaries as now used, possessed and controlled by the Seller or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable. All of the machinery, equipment and other
tangible personal property and assets owned or used by the Seller and its
Subsidiaries, in the aggregate, are in serviceable condition, maintenance and
repair, except for ordinary wear and tear.



4.17 _Environmental Liability_. There are no legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions, causes of action, private environmental
investigations or remediation activities or governmental investigations of any
nature seeking to impose, or that are reasonably likely to result in the
imposition, on the Seller of any liability or obligation arising under common
law or under any local, state or federal environmental statute, regulation or
ordinance including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, pending or threatened against the
Seller, which liability or obligation would reasonably be expected to have,
either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Seller. To the knowledge of the Seller, there is no reasonable basis for any
such proceeding, claim, action or governmental investigation that would impose
any liability or obligation that would be reasonably likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller.
The Seller is not subject to any agreement, order, judgment, decree, letter or
memorandum by or with any Governmental Authority or third party imposing any
liability or obligation with respect to the foregoing that would reasonably
be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Seller.



4.18 _State Takeover Laws; Stockholder Rights Agreement_. The Seller has taken
all action necessary to exempt this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby from Section
203 of DGCL, and, accordingly, such Section does not apply to any such
transactions. The board of directors of Seller has amended the Seller

SEC a mutually acceptable joint proxy statement/prospectus (the " _Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus_ ") and the Buyer shall prepare and cause to be filed
with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 covering the issuance of
the Merger Consideration (" _Form S-4 Registration Statement_ "), in which the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus. Each of the
Buyer



 

45 and the Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any
comments of the SEC or its staff and to have the Form S-4 Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after it is filed with the SEC and to keep the Form S-4
Registration Statement effective through the Effective Time or termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII hereof. Buyer and Seller shall, as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party copies
of any written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments with
respect to the Joint Proxy Statement Prospectus or Form S-4 Registration
Statement (or any document incorporated therein by reference) received from
the SEC. Each party shall cooperate and provide the other party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Joint Proxy Statement Prospectus and the Form S-4 Registration
Statement prior to filing such with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein to the contrary (but subject to the rights of the
Seller pursuant to Section 6.5), no amendment or supplement (including
incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Form S-4 Registration Statement shall be made without the approval of each
party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ that with respect to documents filed by a party which are
incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form
S-4 Registration Statement, this right of approval shall apply only with
respect to information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations. Each party will advise the other party,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4
Registration Statement becomes effective, the issuance of any stop order, the
suspension of the qualification of the Buyer Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Form S-4 Registration Statement or

efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the
Buyers stockholders, and the Seller will use reasonable best efforts to
cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Sellers
stockholders, in either case, as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act; 
_provided_ , _however_ _,_ that the parties shall consult and cooperate with
each other in determining the appropriate time for mailing the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in light of the date set for the Seller
Stockholders Meeting and the Buyer Stockholders Meeting. If the Buyer or
the Seller becomes aware of any information that should be disclosed in an
amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 Registration Statement or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, then such party shall promptly inform the other
thereof and shall cooperate with the other in filing such amendment or
supplement with the SEC and, if appropriate, in mailing such amendment or
supplement to the stockholders of the Buyer and the Seller.



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall use reasonable best
efforts to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to ensure that Buyer Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger will be registered or qualified under the
securities law of every jurisdiction of the United States necessary to effect
the Merger;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall not be required
(i) to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction in
which it is not now qualified, or (ii) to file a general consent to service of
process in any jurisdiction.

approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and, unless withdrawn in accordance with the provisions of Section

recommendation by such board of directors. Subject to Section 6.5, the Seller
shall not approve or recommend (or propose to approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal) or make or authorize any public statement in support of
any Acquisition Proposal. The Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take all such other actions necessary or desirable to obtain such approval of
its stockholders. Except to the extent required by law, the Seller shall not
(i) change or otherwise take any action after the mailing of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus that would result in a change of the date
specified in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the Sellers
Stockholders Meeting or (ii) otherwise take any action that would postpone or
delay the Sellers Stockholders Meeting, except (x) to the extent necessary
to ensure that any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus required by applicable law is provided to the
stockholders of the Seller in advance of the Sellers Stockholders Meeting or
(y) that the Seller shall adjourn or postpone the Seller Stockholders Meeting
for up to fourteen (14) days if there are an insufficient number of shares of
Seller Common Stock represented in person or by proxy at the
Sellers Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum or to approve and adopt
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, so long as during
such adjournment or postponement the Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain a quorum and the requisite vote to approve and adopt this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



(c) The Sellers obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Seller
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 6.2(a) shall not be limited

withdrawal, modification, qualification or amendment by the board of directors
of the Seller, or any committee thereof, of such board of directors or such
committees approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.



 

47 6.3 _Buyer Stockholders  Meeting_.

the Buyer Stockholders Meeting) will be considered at such meeting. The
Buyer Stockholders Meeting shall be held on the same day as the Seller
Stockholders Meeting.



(b) The board of directors of the Buyer has recommended and declared advisable
that its stockholders approve the issuance of shares of Buyer Common Stock in
the Merger and the Buyer shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Prior to the Effective Time, neither the board of
directors of the Buyer nor any committee thereof shall withdraw, modify,
qualify or amend (or propose to withdraw, modify, qualify or amend) the
approval or recommendation by such board of directors in a manner adverse to
Seller. The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all such other
actions necessary or desirable to obtain such approval of its stockholders or
approve or recommend (or publicly propose to approve or recommend) any
Acquisition Proposal. Except to the extent required by law, the Buyer shall
not (i) change or otherwise take any action after the mailing of the Proxy
Statement that would result in a change of the date specified in the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the Buyers Stockholders Meeting or (ii)
otherwise take any action that would postpone or delay the Buyers
Stockholders Meeting, except (x) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement required by applicable law is
provided to the stockholders of the Buyer in advance of the

the Buyer Stockholders Meeting for up to fourteen (14) days if there are an
insufficient number of shares of Buyer Common Stock represented in person or
by proxy at the Buyers Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum or to
approve the transactions contemplated hereby, so long as during such
adjournment or postponement the Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain a quorum and the requisite vote to approve the transactions
contemplated hereby.



(c) The Buyers obligation to call, give notice of and hold the Buyer

of such board of directors or such committees approval or recommendation of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.



6.4 _Third Party Consents and Regulatory Approvals_.



(a) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals,
authorizations and clearances (including under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act, the " _HSR Act_ ") of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities which are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Merger),
and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all such third parties and Governmental

 



 

48 Authorities. The Buyer and the Seller shall have the right to have their
counsel review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult
the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange
of information, all the information relating to such party, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising
the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will consult with
each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals
and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating
to completion of the transactions contemplated herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section shall require the Buyer to agree with any
Governmental Authority to (i) the imposition of any material restrictions on
its business, or (ii) the sale, divestiture, lease, license, disposition or
other transfer of any assets or properties of the Buyer, the Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries.



(b) The Buyer and the Seller shall promptly advise each other upon receiving
(and the Buyer or the Seller shall so advise with respect to communications
received by any subsidiary or Affiliate of the Buyer or the Seller, as the
case may be) any communication from any Governmental Authority or third party
whose consent or approval is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval or third-party
consent will not be obtained or that the receipt of any such approval will be
materially delayed.



6.5 _No Solicitation_.



(a) The Seller agrees and covenants that, except as authorized or permitted in
this Section 6.5, it shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or its Subsidiaries directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, agents, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, brokers, finders, consultants or representatives
(collectively, " _Agents_ ") to, directly or indirectly, invite, solicit,
initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing
or disclosing nonpublic information) any inquiries, proposals, discussions or
negotiations or the making or implementation of any offer or proposal
(including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its stockholders)
with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, or participate in any discussions or negotiations with,
or provide any information any Person (other than the Buyer and its Affiliates
or Agents) with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in
principle, definitive agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that, at any time prior to
obtaining the approval and adoption of the Sellers stockholders of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and so long as
the Seller shall not have breached any of the provisions of this Section 6.5,
the Seller or its Agents may furnish or cause to be furnished information to,
and negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, any person that has
made after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition Proposal if and only to
the extent that (i) the board of directors of the Seller determines in good
faith (x) after consultation with its



 

49 outside legal counsel that such action is required by its fiduciary duties
under applicable law and (y) after consultation with its financial advisor,
such Acquisition Proposal would if consummated, constitute a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Seller provides written notice to the Buyer to the effect
that it is furnishing information to, or entering into or participating in
discussions or negotiations with, such Person (including, without limitation,
the identity of such Person), (iii) the Seller keeps the Buyer informed of the
status of any such discussions or negotiations, including,
without limitation, promptly informing the Buyer (but in any event, within 24
hours) of all material developments relating thereto and (iv) prior to
furnishing any information to such Person, the Seller shall enter into a
customary confidentiality agreement with such individual or entity that is no
less restrictive, in any respect, than the Confidentiality Agreement dated as
of April 2, 2004 by and between the Buyer and the Seller (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and the Seller shall enforce, and shall not
waive any of the provisions of, any such confidentiality agreement. Without
limiting the foregoing, if any Subsidiary of the Seller or any Agent takes or
permits to be taken any action which, if taken or permitted to be taken by
the Seller itself, would be a breach of a provision of this Section 6.5, it
shall be deemed to be a breach thereof by the Seller for all purposes of this
Section 6.5, including 6.5(c); provided that, in the case of any such Agent,
to be deemed a breach of this Section 6.5 by the Seller, such action must be
taken by, or with the encouragement or the prior knowledge of, an individual
in the business unit (including for purposes of the Sellers financial
advisor, such advisors Investment Banking Business Segment (as described in
such advisors Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003)) of such Agent
which is acting for the Seller in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. 



(b) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Seller shall cease immediately and
cause to be terminated, and shall cause its Agents and Subsidiaries and its
Subsidiaries Agents to cease, any and all existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to, or that
would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and promptly
request that all confidential information with respect thereto furnished on
behalf of the Seller be returned or destroyed pursuant to the terms of any
confidentiality agreement, and the Seller shall enforce, and shall not waive
any of the provisions of, any such confidentiality agreement.



(c) Nothing contained in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the board of
directors of the Seller from, prior to the Seller Stockholders
Meeting, withdrawing, modifying, qualifying or amending in a manner
materially adverse to the Buyer its recommendation to the Sellers
stockholders required under Section 6.2(b) in response to an unsolicited _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (A) if, but only if: (i) after
consultation with the Sellers outside legal counsel, the board of directors
of the Seller determines in good faith that such action is required by its
fiduciary duties under applicable law; (ii) after consultation with its
financial advisor, the board of directors of the Seller has determined in good
faith that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal; (iii) the Seller
has given the Buyer five (5) business days prior written notice of
its intention to withdraw, modify, qualify or amend in a manner materially
adverse to the Buyer its recommendation to the Sellers stockholders required
under Section 6.2(b) and (iv) the Seller is not in breach in any material
respect of any of the provisions of Section 6.5 and (B) if, in the event
that, during such five (5) business days, the Buyer makes a counterproposal to
such Acquisition Proposal (any such counterproposal, a " _Counterproposal_ "),
the board of directors of the Seller, after consultation with its financial
advisor, determines in good faith that (x) the



 

50 Counterproposal is not at least as favorable to the Sellers stockholders as
the Acquisition Proposal from a financial point of view, and (y) the
Counterproposal is not at least as favorable generally to the Sellers
stockholders as the Acquisition Proposal (taking into account all financial
and strategic considerations and other relevant factors, including relevant
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposals, and the
conditions, prospects and time required for completion of such Acquisition
Proposal). Any disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act) made pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall be deemed a change in the
Sellers recommendation to its stockholders required under Section 6.2(b) in a
manner materially adverse to the Buyer, unless, as a part of such disclosure,
the board of directors of the Seller expressly reaffirms its recommendation to
its stockholders in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of
the Merger. Any such withdrawal, modification, qualification or amendment of
the recommendation of the board of directors of the Seller shall not change
the approval of such board for purposes of causing any state takeover statute
or other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or by any of the other Transaction Documents. Nothing in this
Section 6.5 shall affect the Sellers obligation to hold the Seller
Stockholders Meeting in accordance with Section 6.2. 



(d) [Intentionally omitted]



(e) From and after the execution of this Agreement, the Seller shall
notify the Buyer promptly (but in any event within twenty-four hours) of the
receipt, directly or indirectly, of any inquiries, discussions, negotiations,
proposals or expressions of interest with respect to or that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal (including a summary of the
material terms and conditions thereof, including price, and the identity of
the other individual or entity or individuals or entities (including any
parent entities thereof to the extent known) making such proposal), and
promptly furnish to the Buyer a copy of any such request for information or
written proposal in addition to a copy of any information provided by any
third party relating thereto. In addition, the Seller shall
immediately advise the Buyer, in writing, if the board of directors of the
Seller shall make any determination as to any Acquisition Proposal as
contemplated by the proviso to the first sentence of Section 6.5(a).



(f) Nothing in this Section 6.5 shall prohibit the Seller from complying
with Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that,
in so doing, it does not take or disclose any position or actions that do not
comply with the provisions of Section 6.2(b) or this Section 6.5.



(g) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean
any _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal relating to more than 50% of the
outstanding shares of Seller Common Stock or more than 50% of the Sellers
assets made by a third party that was not solicited by the Seller or any of
its Agents which the board of directors of the Seller determines in good faith
after consultation with its financial advisor, to be more favorable to the
Sellers stockholders than the Merger from a financial point of view and to
have a likelihood of successful completion on the terms proposed (including
any financing conditions with respect thereto) that is at least as likely as
the transactions contemplated hereby, after taking into account all relevant
financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal,
including



 

51 the proposed financing for such Acquisition Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer for a
direct or indirect (i) merger, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution, business combination or consolidation, or any
similar transaction, involving the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii)
sale, lease exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other acquisition or
assumption of all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Seller on a
consolidated basis in one or a series of related transactions, or (iii)
purchase, tender offer or other acquisition (including by way of merger,
consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of beneficial ownership (the term
"beneficial ownership" for purposes of this Agreement having the meaning
assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder) of securities representing fifteen percent (15%) or
more of the voting power of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_
, _however_ , that the term " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall not include the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or by any of the other
Transaction Documents.



6.6 _Access to Information_.



(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, Buyer and Seller, shall each, and shall cause each
of their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel and other representatives of the other, access, during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to all
of its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and, during such
period, each of the Buyer and the Seller shall, and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to, make available to the other (i) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or received
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal securities
laws (other than reports or documents which such party is not permitted to
disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request.
The Buyer and the Seller also shall provide such other party with reasonable
access to their respective officers, employees and agents and with copies of
all periodic reports to their respective senior management. None of the Buyer,
the Seller or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The
parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. No
investigation by the Buyer, the Seller or their respective representatives
shall affect the representations and warranties of the parties set forth
herein.



(b) With respect to all information furnished by one party to the other
party or its representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall comply
with, and shall cause their respective representatives to comply with, all of
their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement.



6.7 _Employment and Benefit Matters_.



(a) _Provision of Benefits_. For the 12 month period commencing on
the Closing Date, the Buyer agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain the compensation and benefit levels, including cash-based incentives,
retirement, health and welfare benefits, and



 

52 any stock-based benefits, for the employees of the Seller who remain employed
after the Effective Time (the " _Seller Employees_ ") at the same levels
which are, in the aggregate, comparable to those in effect for the Seller
Employees on the date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amount that
would be payable in the form of restricted stock shall be payable by the
Buyer, at its option, in the form of either cash or stock options of
equivalent value (with the understanding that any calculation of stock options
of equivalent value shall be made in accordance with the procedures set forth
in Section 6.7(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule). The Buyer and the Seller
shall make any necessary amendments to their respective benefit plans to
effectuate the preceding sentence, including, without limitation,
any amendment to exclude each others employees from their respective 401(k)
plans during such 12 month period. Thereafter, the Buyer agrees to cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide the Seller Employees with at least the types
and levels of employee benefits (including employee contribution levels)
maintained from time to time by the Buyer or any subsidiary of the Buyer for
similarly-situated employees of the Buyer. The Buyer will treat, and cause the
applicable benefit plans to treat, the service of the Seller Employees with
the Seller or any subsidiary of the Seller attributable to any period before
the Effective Time as service rendered to the Buyer or any subsidiary of the
Buyer for all purposes, but not for benefit accrual (including minimum
pension amount), including eligibility for early retirement under any Buyer
Pension Plan or eligibility for retiree welfare benefit plans. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Buyer shall cause any pre-existing conditions
or limitations, eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations
under any health or similar plan of the Buyer to be waived with respect to the
Seller Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived under the
corresponding plan in which the Seller Employee participated immediately
prior to the Closing Date, and any deductibles paid under any of the Sellers
or its Subsidiaries health plans shall be credited towards deductibles under
the health plans of the Buyer or any subsidiary of the Buyer upon delivery to
the Buyer of appropriate documentation. The Buyer will make appropriate
arrangements with its insurance carrier(s) to ensure such result.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and subject to Section 6.7(e)
hereof, the Seller Employees who remain employed after the Effective Time
shall be considered to be employed by the Buyer "at will" and nothing shall be
construed to limit the ability of the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to
terminate the employment of any such Seller Employee at any time, subject to
the payment of any severance in accordance with the terms and conditions of
any Seller severance agreement, plan and arrangement in existence as of the
date hereof, still in effect as of the date of such termination of
employment, and disclosed in Section 6.7(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
(the " _Seller Severance Arrangements_ ").



(b) _Continuation of Plans_. Subject to Sections 6.7(a) and (e) hereof, the
Buyer shall have sole discretion with respect to the determination as to
whether or when to terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and
programs of the Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer shall continue
to maintain the Seller plans (other than stock-based plans) until the Seller
Employees are permitted to participate in the plans of the Buyer or any
subsidiary of the Buyer in accordance with Section 6.7(a).



(c) _Employment Agreements_. In its discretion, the Buyer shall enter into
employment agreements, contingent on the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, with the Seller Key Employees, if any, identified in
Section 6.7(c) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule. The Seller shall use its
reasonable best efforts to assist the Buyer in effecting the foregoing.



 

53 (d) _Seller Severance Program_. The Buyer shall maintain the Seller Severance
Arrangements in existence as of the date hereof, in accordance with the terms
in effect as of the date hereof, for a period of at least 12 months following
the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any amounts paid pursuant to
such Seller Severance Arrangements are expressly subject to the recipients
execution of a release of claims in a form mutually agreed to by the Buyer and
the Seller (it being understood that such release shall explicitly exclude, if
applicable, claims for retention bonus payments and payments under the Seller
Incentive Program).



(e) _Seller Incentive Program_. Those Seller Employees who are participants in
the Seller Incentive Program shall be eligible to receive the amount accrued
under such program as of the Closing Date; _provided_ that any such
amount shall be payable at the time specified in the Seller Incentive Program
and any amount that, under the terms of the Seller Incentive Program, would be
payable in the form of restricted stock shall be payable by the Buyer in the
form of either cash or stock options of equivalent value (with the
understanding that any calculation of stock options of equivalent value shall
be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 6.7(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule); and _provided further_ , that should any such
participant voluntarily terminate his or her employment with the Seller or the
Buyer, as applicable, prior to the date that such amounts are paid, the
participant shall forfeit the right to any such payment under the Seller
Incentive Program.



(f) _Assumption of Certain Agreements_. The Buyer agrees to assume and honor
in accordance with their terms the agreements set forth in Section 6.7(f) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule between the Seller and designated employees of
Seller.



(g) _Continuation of Employment_. No provision of this Section 6.7
shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any employee or former
employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Seller or any
subsidiary of the Seller in respect of continued employment (or resumed
employment) with the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of the Buyers
Subsidiaries, and no provision of this Section 6.7 shall create such rights in
any such persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any employee program or any plan or arrangement which may
be established by the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.



6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.



(a) Buyer agrees that any provisions with respect to indemnification now
existing in favor of the directors or officers of the Seller and the directors
or officers of the Seller Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ " and,
each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as contained in their respective
organizational documents, in effect as of the date hereof and the
indemnification agreements set forth in Section 6.8 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of six years after the Effective Time. During such period, the Buyer
shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify such provisions for
indemnification in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of individuals who at any time prior to the Effective Time were
directors or officers of the Seller or directors or officers of any Seller
Subsidiary in respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement), unless such



 

54 modification is required by law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event
any claim or claims are asserted or made either prior to the Effective Time
or within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of
any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such
claims.



(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall purchase a non-
cancelable extended reporting period endorsement under its existing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the Sellers
directors and officers in the same form as maintained by the Seller
immediately prior to the date hereof, which shall provide such directors and
officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time of not
less than the existing coverage under, and have the same terms as the
insurance coverage presently maintained by the Seller, so long as the
aggregate cost is not greater than $1,100,000; _provided_ , that if such
insurance is not available under Buyers existing directors and officers
liability coverage, Buyer shall purchase such insurance under Sellers then
existing directors and officers liability coverage and; _provided_ _further_
that the Seller agrees to cooperate in good faith with the Buyer in order to
obtain the lowest premium for such coverage. In the event that $1,100,000 is
insufficient for such coverage, the Buyer may spend up to that amount to
purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such amount. The Buyer
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain such policies in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.



(c) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and
representatives, and nothing herein shall affect any indemnification rights
that any Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives may have
under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Seller or the
equivalent documents of any of the Sellers Subsidiaries, any contract or
applicable law.



6.9 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals,
immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense
of, the Buyer.



6.10 _Advice of Changes_. The Buyer and the Seller shall each promptly notify
the other party of any change or event having a Material Adverse Effect on it
or which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause
the conditions in Section 7.2 or Section 7.3, as applicable not to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 6.10 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.



6.11 _Current Information_.



(a) As soon as practicable, the Seller and the Buyer will furnish to the
other copies of all such financial statements and reports as it or any of its
Subsidiaries shall send to its stockholders, the SEC or any other Governmental
Authority, to the extent any such reports furnished to any such Governmental
Authority are not confidential and except as legally prohibited thereby, and
will furnish to the other such additional financial data as the other may
reasonably request.



 

55 (b) Promptly upon receipt thereof, the Seller or Buyer, as applicable, will
furnish to the other copies of all final internal control reports submitted
to the Seller and its Subsidiaries by independent auditors in connection with
each annual, interim or special audit of the books of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries made by such auditors.



6.12 _Section 16 Matters_. The Buyer and the Seller agree that, in order to
most effectively compensate and retain Seller Insiders (as defined below) in
connection with the Merger, both prior to and after the Effective Time, it is
desirable that Seller Insiders not be subject to risk of liability under
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law in connection with the conversion of Seller Common Stock and
Seller Options into shares of Buyer Common Stock and options to purchase Buyer
Common Stock, respectively, in the Merger, and for that compensatory and
retentive purpose agree to the provisions of this Section 6.12. Assuming that
the Seller delivers to the Buyer the Section 16 Information (as defined below)
in a timely fashion, Buyer Board, or a committee of Non-Employee Directors
thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the
Exchange Act), shall adopt a resolution providing that the receipt by Seller
Insiders of Buyer Common Stock in exchange for shares of Seller Common Stock
and of options to purchase Buyer Common Stock upon conversion of Buyer
Options, in each case pursuant to the Merger and to the extent such securities
are listed in the Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt from
liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act. The Seller Board,
or a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof shall adopt a resolution
providing that the disposition by Seller Insiders of Seller Common Stock in
exchange for shares of Buyer Common Stock and of Seller Options upon
conversion into Buyer Options, in each case pursuant to the Merger are
intended to be exempt from liability pursuant to Section 16(b) under the
Exchange Act. " _Section 16 Information_ " shall mean information accurate in
all material respects regarding the Seller Insiders, the number of shares of
Seller Common Stock held by each such Seller Insider and expected to be
exchanged for Buyer Common Stock in the Merger and the number and description
