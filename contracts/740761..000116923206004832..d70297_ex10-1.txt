<PAGE>
                                       18


            are  not   available  on  such  date,   Reuters   world  spot  rates
            (www.investing.reuters.co.uk/investing/currencies.aspx)   taken   as
            close as possible to 2.15 p.m.  CET of the Business Day prior to the
            relevant date shall be used. All conversions  necessary to calculate
            the  Closing  Date Net Cash  shall  be made in  accordance  with the
            procedure set forth in this Section 4.1.3 as of the Closing Date.

4.2         Cash Pool Settlement.

4.2.1       Termination  of  Intercompany  Finance  Agreements.  The  Seller has
            entered  into two cash pool  agreements  with the Company  regarding
            receivables and payables,  one of them denominated in US Dollar (the
            "US Dollar Finance Agreement"),  the other agreement  denominated in
            Euro (the "EURO Finance Agreement"). The US Dollar Finance Agreement
            and the EURO Finance Agreement shall  collectively be referred to as
            the "Finance Agreements".

            The Seller shall procure that the Finance  Agreements are terminated
            with  economic  effect  as  of  the  Closing  Date  without  further
            liability to any of the Group Companies.

4.2.2       Cash Pool Balance.  The Seller shall procure that all receivables as
            of the Closing Date under the US Dollar Finance  Agreement which the
            Company  has  from the  Seller,  or which  the  Seller  has from the
            Company, will be converted into Euros at the foreign reference rates
            (as  determined  pursuant to Section  4.1.3) as of the Closing Date.
            Subsequent to such  conversion all receivables the Company may have,
            as of the Closing Date, from the Seller under the Finance Agreements
            shall be set off against all  receivables the Seller may have, as of
            the Closing  Date,  from the Company  under the Finance  Agreements.
            Such amount shall be referred to herein as the "Cash Pool Balance ".
            The Cash Pool Balance shall be taken into account in the calculation
            of the  Closing  Date  Net  Cash.  If the  Cash  Pool  Balance  is a
            receivable  of the Company  from the Seller,  then the Seller  shall
            discharge such receivable by making a payment equal to the Cash Pool
            Balance to the Company.  If the Cash Pool Balance is a receivable of
            the Seller from the Company,  then the Seller shall, against payment
            of the  Preliminary  Cash Pool  Balance by the  Purchaser,  sell and
            assign such  receivable to the  Purchaser on the Closing  Date.  The
            Purchaser  and the Seller shall procure that the Company shall agree
            to the assignment of the receivable.

4.2.3       Treatment of special  kinds of  receivables  and  payables.  For the
            avoidance  of doubt,  it is hereby  clarified  that for  purposes of
            Section 4.2

            (i)   receivables and payables  resulting from supplies and services
                  (Forderungen   und   Verbindlichkeiten   aus  Lieferungen  und
                  Leistungen)  between  the Seller on the one hand and the Group
                  Companies  on the other hand shall be settled in the  Ordinary
                  Course of business and, therefore, under no circumstances (not
                  even  in  a  situation   where  they  are   interest   bearing
                  liabilities)  be  treated as  receivables  or  payables  under
                  Finance Agreements; and

            (ii)  interest payable on receivables and payables under the Finance
                  Agreements  until (and  including)  the Closing  Date shall be
                  treated  as   receivables   or  payables   under  the  Finance
                  Agreements.

            On the Closing  Purchaser shall pay the Cash Portion and shall cause
            the issuance of the Consideration  Shares. The Cash Portion shall be
            referred to as the "Preliminary Purchase Price".

4.3.2       Final Purchase Price

            The Purchase Price shall be considered  finally  determined once the
            Purchase  Price  Determination  Statements  have  become  final  and
            binding  upon the  Parties  as  provided  for in  Section  5. If the
            Purchase  Price  (reduced by the Share Value) so determined  exceeds
            the Preliminary  Purchase  Price,  the Purchaser shall pay an amount
            equal to such excess within 5 Business Days after the Purchase Price
            Determination  Statements  have  become  final and  binding.  If the
            Purchase  Price  (reduced  by the Share  Value)  falls  short of the
            Preliminary  Purchase  Price,  the Seller shall pay an amount to the
            Purchaser  equal to the  shortfall  within 5 Business Days after the
            Purchase  Price  Determination  Statements  have  become  final  and
            binding.  The amount so payable shall bear interest at a rate of 5.5
            % p.a. for the benefit of the respective creditor from and including
            the Closing Date until, but excluding the date of actual payment.

4.3.3       Cash Pool Balance.

            (i)   Not later than 3 Business  Days prior to the expected  Closing
                  Date,  the Seller  shall  estimate in good faith the  expected
                  amount of the Cash Pool  Balance  as of the  expected  Closing
                  Date (the  "Preliminary  Cash Pool  Balance") and shall notify
                  the  Purchaser  in  writing  about the  Preliminary  Cash Pool
                  Balance.

            (ii)  If the  Preliminary  Cash Pool Balance is a receivable  of the
                  Company from the Seller,  the Seller shall pay, on the Closing
                  Date, to the Company an amount equal to the  Preliminary  Cash
                  Pool Balance.

            (iii) If the  Preliminary  Cash Pool Balance is a receivable  of the
                  Seller  from the  Company,  the  Purchaser  shall pay,  on the
                  Closing Date, to the Seller an amount equal to the Preliminary
                  Cash  Pool  Balance   against  sale  and  assignment  of  such
                  receivable to the Purchaser.

            (iv)  Within 14 Business Days after the Closing Date,  the Purchaser
                  shall  procure  that  the  Company  and the  Seller  determine
                  jointly the exact Cash Pool Balance as of the Closing Date.

            (v)   If the Cash Pool Balance is a  receivable  of the Company from
                  the Seller,  any difference  between the Preliminary Cash Pool
                  Balance and the Cash Pool Balance as  determined by the Seller
                  and the  Company  shall be paid as  follows:  If the Cash Pool
                  Balance exceeds the Preliminary Cash Pool Balance, the

                  Seller shall pay such  difference to the Company.  If the Cash
                  Pool Balance is less than the  Preliminary  Cash Pool Balance,
                  the  Purchaser  shall  procure that the Company shall pay such
                  difference to the Seller.

            (vi)  If the Cash Pool  Balance is a  receivable  of the Seller from
                  the Company,  any difference between the Preliminary Cash Pool
                  Balance and the Cash Pool Balance as  determined by the Seller
                  and the  Company  shall be paid as  follows:  If the Cash Pool
                  Balance  exceeds  the  Preliminary  Cash  Pool  Balance,   the
                  Purchaser shall pay such difference to the Seller. If the Cash
                  Pool Balance is less than the  Preliminary  Cash Pool Balance,
                  the Seller shall pay such difference to the Purchaser.

            (vii) Any such  amount to be paid by  either  the  Purchaser  or the
                  Seller  or the  Company,  as the  case  may be,  shall be paid
                  within ten Business Days after the  determination  of the Cash
                  Pool Balance.  In case of a dispute  concerning the final Cash
                  Pool Balance, Section 5.2 shall apply accordingly.

4.4         IPO. In the event of an  underwritten  public  offering of shares or

            Subsidiaries  in the 2008 or 2009 calendar year, the Seller shall be

            the  Seller  and / or the  Purchaser,  as the  case  may be,  to the

            the Seller and / or the  Purchaser,  respectively,  in the  required
            manner,  the Seller and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to
            settle the  disagreement.  If the Seller  and the  Purchaser  cannot
            settle the  disagreement  within  thirty  days after  receipt by the
            Respective  Party of the other Party's  statement of objections  and

            respective  request for such  designation or if the Neutral  Auditor
            resigns from its assignment,  the Neutral Auditor shall be appointed
            by the German  Institute  of  Chartered  Accountants  (Institut  der
            Wirtschaftsprufer  in  Deutschland  e.V.) at the  request  of either
            Party  after  consideration  of the  proposals  and  comments by the
            Seller and the Purchaser. The Seller and the Purchaser shall jointly
            instruct  the  Neutral  Auditor  to decide  the issues in dispute in

            by the Seller and the Purchaser  jointly,  the Neutral Auditor shall

            of  such  decisions  and the  undisputed  parts  of the  Preliminary
            Purchase Price Determination Statements determine the Purchase Price
            Determination Statements in their entirety. In respect of the issues
            in dispute the decisions of the Neutral  Auditor shall remain within
            the positions  taken by the Seller and the Purchaser.  To the extent
            necessary  for the  decisions  the  Neutral  Auditor  shall  also be
            entitled  to decide on the  interpretation  of this  Agreement.  The

            Neutral  Auditor  the  Preliminary   Purchase  Price   Determination

            Neutral Auditor shall immediately submit copies of all documents and
            other  data made  available  by the Seller or the  Purchaser  to the
            respective  other Party as well.  Before  making the  decisions  the
            Neutral  Auditor  shall  grant  the  Seller  and the  Purchaser  the
            opportunity  to present  their  positions,  which shall  include the
            opportunity  of at least one oral  hearing  in the  presence  of the
            Seller  and the  Purchaser  and  their  professional  advisors.  The
            Neutral  Auditor  shall use its best  efforts to deliver its written
            opinion  with  reasons  for the  decisions  as  soon  as  reasonably
            practical, but not later than sixty days after the issues in dispute
            have been referred to the Neutral Auditor. The Neutral

            it  shall  within  five  Business  Days  of the  receipt  of the MAC

            Eidenmuller  is not able or  willing  to decide  on the MAC  Dispute
            Notice Section 5.2.1 third sentence shall apply mutatis mutandis. In

            withdraw  (zurucktreten) from this Agreement.  In the event that the
            Closing  Conditions  pursuant to Sections 7.1.1(vi) or, only in case
            the lack of execution  of the Forward  Purchase is due to a fault of
            Bucyrus, 7.1.1(xvi) have not been fulfilled or waived prior to or on
            September 30, 2007 the Seller may withdraw  (zurucktreten) from this
            Agreement.  In the event  that any  Closing  Condition  set forth in
            Section 7.1.1(i) through  7.1.1(iv) has not been fulfilled or waived
            (if  capable of being  waived)  prior to or on  September  30,  2007
            either Party may withdraw from this  Agreement.  The withdrawal must
            be stated by  written  notice to the  respective  other  Party.  The
            effect  of  a  withdrawal   shall  be  limited  to  eliminating  the
            obligations of the Party to consummate  this Agreement and shall not
            prejudice any claims the withdrawing  Party may have on the basis of
            any  circumstances  relating to the  non-fulfillment  of any Closing
            Condition.

            (iv) HT has any  further  operations  or  assets  other  than the HT
            Shares  or has any  further  business  purpose  than to hold  the HT
            Shares,  either Party which  becomes  aware of those  changes  shall
            inform the other Party in writing without undue delay.  Upon receipt

                  to  the  Shareholders'  Agreement  and  the  Forward  Purchase
                  Agreement.

            (i)   If the Deloitte  Report  contains  matters  other than matters
                  related to Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan (as disclosed to the

                  D.C.,  on  December  6,  2007)  that  individually  or in  the
                  aggregate  result or can  reasonably  be expected to result in

                  Purchaser's  Guarantor of up to EUR 3,000,000 (in words:  Euro
                  three million), the Purchaser shall have the following rights:
                  (y) the Purchaser may request from the Seller that, subject to
                  the fulfillment or the waiver of the other Closing Conditions,
                  the Transaction is consummated in accordance with Section 7.2,
                  and the Purchaser  may claim from the Seller the  compensation
                  of the 10.2 Losses;  or (z) prior to Closing the Purchaser may
                  request from the Seller that,  subject to the  fulfillment  or
                  the waiver of the other Closing Conditions, the Transaction is

                  entitled  to  withdraw  from this  Agreement  pursuant to this
                  clause. If the Closing  Condition in Section  7.1.1(xviii) has

                  by Section 10.2 without applying the factor 6.

                  aggregate  result or can  reasonably  be expected to result in
                  10.2  Losses  of  any  Group  Company,  the  Purchaser  or the

                  10.2 Losses  multiplied by 6 (in words: six) in which case the
                  Seller  shall  have  the  right  to  (A)  withdraw  from  this
                  Agreement  in  accordance  with  Section  7.1.6  and,  for the
                  avoidance of doubt,  neither the Purchaser nor the Purchaser's
                  Guarantor  shall be entitled to any  claims,  compensation  or
                  payments  (other than the break up fee in accordance  with the
                  requirements  set forth in detail in  Section  7.3) under this
                  Agreement  or  in  accordance  with  applicable  law,  or  (B)
                  acknowledge the claim in full made by

                  fulfillment of the other Closing Conditions,  the consummation
                  of the  Transaction in accordance  with Section 7.2 and effect
                  payment  on the  Closing  Date to  Purchaser  of an  aggregate
                  amount equal to the acknowledged  10.2 Losses multiplied by 6,
                  provided  that  nothing  in this  Section  7.1.8  shall  limit
                  Purchaser's  and  Purchaser  Guarantor's  rights  pursuant  to
                  Section 10.2.

            Event is being  performed at the Closing and shall not prejudice any
            claims the Seller or, as the case may be, the  Purchaser may have on
            the basis of any circumstances  relating to the  non-performance  of
            such Closing Event.

            "Closing  Confirmation") that all Closing Events have been performed
            or waived and that the Closing has  occurred.  For the  avoidance of
            doubt,  unless  specifically  set  forth  otherwise  in the  Closing
            Confirmation, the legal effect of such statement shall be limited to
            serve as evidence  that all Closing  Events have been  performed  or

            the Seller may withdraw from this Agreement by written notice to the
            Purchaser,  unless  the  non-performance  of the  Closing  Events is
            within the control of or the  responsibility  of the Seller  stating
            the  withdrawal  and (ii)  the  Purchaser  may  withdraw  from  this
            Agreement   by   written   notice   to  the   Seller,   unless   the
            non-performance  of the  Closing  Events is within the control of or
            the responsibility of the Purchaser, stating the withdrawal, in each
            case provided that the withdrawal shall be deemed void and shall not
            have any  effect if at the time when the notice is  received  by the
            other Party all Closing Events have been performed.

7.3         No shop;  Breakup Fee. As from the Signing  Date until  beginning of
            the Closing,  the Seller and RBV shall not, and shall not permit any

            breaches of the  representations  in this Section 8 irrespective  of
            any  fault  of the  Seller  (verschuldensunabhangig),  the  Seller's

            including de minimis amounts,  thresholds and maximum  amounts,  set
            forth in Section 9, and in view of these  modalities and limitations

            insolvency nor similar  proceedings  have been applied for or opened
            over  the  assets  of the  Seller  or RBV or  denied  due to lack of
            sufficient   assets.   The  Seller  and  RBV  are  neither  illiquid

8.8         IP Rights

8.8.1       Owned IP Rights.  Disclosure  Schedule 8.8.1 contains a complete and
            correct  list  of all IP  Rights  (other  than  know-how)  owned  or
            co-owned by any Group  Company as of the Signing  Date and which are
            necessary  and used for the  manufacturing  of the  products  by the
            Group Companies or otherwise material for the respective business of
            the Group  Companies  (the "Owned IP Rights").  Disclosure  Schedule
            8.8.1 correctly  states for each such Owned IP Right (if applicable)
            the type,  applicable register,  application or other identification
            data in the  respective  jurisdiction  and owner or applicant.  With
            respect to patents,  utility  models and design  rights,  Disclosure

            protection available.

8.8.2       No Encumbrances.  Each Group Company is the  unrestricted  legal and
            beneficial  owner of the  Owned IP  Rights  and no Owned IP Right is
            encumbered with any rights of any Third Party,  including the Seller
            and the  Seller's  Affiliates,  other than any other Group  Company,
            subject to the disclosure in Disclosure Schedule 8.8.4.

8.8.3       Maintenance.  Except as disclosed in Disclosure  Schedule  8.8.3 (i)
            the Group  Companies  have duly  maintained  all Owned IP Rights and
            have paid when due all registration and renewal fees to maintain all
            registrations  with any  regulatory  authority  with  respect to the
            Owned IP Rights and with respect to  trademarks  have  complied with
            the applicable  use  requirements  (Benutzungspflichten),  if deemed
            commercially reasonable by management of the Group Companies. Except
            as disclosed in Disclosure  Schedule 8.8.3 (ii) no Group Company has
            granted a license

<PAGE>
                                       36


            with  respect to any Owned IP Rights to any Third  Party  other than
            any other Group Company.

8.8.4       No Challenges.  Except as disclosed in Disclosure Schedule 8.8.4, as
            of the Signing Date the validity of the Owned IP Rights has not been
            challenged  or disputed  in any way by any Third  Party  (including,
            without limitation, by any registration authorities), and there are,
            to the  Seller's  Knowledge,  no  circumstances  on  which  any such
            challenge or dispute could be based. To Seller's Knowledge as of the
            Signing Date,  none of the Owned IP Rights are being violated by any
            third party.

8.8.5       Licensed  Intellectual  Property Rights.  Disclosure  Schedule 8.8.5
            contains a complete  and correct  list of all  licenses to IP Rights
            (including IP Rights based on the employees' invention  legislation)
            other than licenses for standard software which have been granted by
            Third  Parties or the  Seller or  Seller's  Affiliates  to the Group
            Companies (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Licenses").

            Unless explicitly  indicated otherwise in Disclosure Schedule 8.8.5,
            the  Group  Companies  have the full and  unencumbered  right to the
            Licenses and all  Licenses  are in full force and effect.  The Group
            Companies  have complied with all material terms of the Licenses and
            have paid all  license  fees under the  Licenses as and when due. To
            Seller's  Knowledge as of the Signing  Date,  there are presently no
            circumstances  under any License  which  could  result in a right of
            termination,  revocation or cancellation  by the relevant  licensor.
            The Group  Companies  have not been  notified in  writing,  that the
            validity  nor  the use of the  Licenses  is or is  threatened  to be
            challenged  or disputed  in any way by any Third  Party  (including,
            without limitation, by any registration authorities).

8.8.6       No Further  Rights  Required.  The Owned IP Rights and the  Licenses
            constitute  the entire rights and licenses with respect to IP Rights
            which the Group  Companies  need in order to carry on their business
            as presently conducted.

8.8.7       Third Party Rights Infringements.  Except as disclosed in Disclosure
            Schedule 8.8.7 none of the Group Companies presently violates or has
            been  notified  in the last two (2) years to have  infringed  any IP
            Rights of any Third Party.

8.8.8       Know How. To Seller's Knowledge, the Group Companies are able to use
            the  know-how  which the Group  Companies  need in order to carry on
            their business as conducted on the Closing Date.

8.8.9       Employee Inventions and Right to Inventions.  Except as set forth in
            Disclosure Schedule 8.8.9, the Group Companies have full,  exclusive
            and  unencumbered  rights to all inventions  which have been made by
            their  employees  or  contractors  within the scope of the  relevant
            employment  or contract to the extent such rights have been obtained
            from the respective employees or contractors. To the extent specific
            employees'   invention   legislation  applies  (including,   without
            limitation,     the     German     Employees'     Inventions     Act
            (Arbeitnehmererfindergesetz)), the Group Companies have asserted all
            rights,  and  complied  with  all  obligations  (including,  without
            limitation,  all payment  obligations)  arising  under the  relevant
            legislation with respect

<PAGE>
                                       37


            to the inventions, if the management of the respective Group Company
            has deemed it beneficial  for the business of the  respective  Group
            Company.  Since  January 1, 2005 no employee of the Group  Companies
            has raised in writing claims with respect to employee inventions and
            to  Seller's   Knowledge  there  are  no  circumstances   which  may
            reasonably be expected to give a right to any such claims.

8.9.1       Owned Assets and Inventories.  The Group Companies are the legal and
            beneficial  owner of all assets  (Anlagevermogen)  (other  than real

            (collectively "Assets and Inventories") which have been reflected in
            the  Stand-Alone   Financial   Statements  (the  "Owned  Assets  and
            Inventories"), except for Assets and Inventories (i) which have been
            disposed of in the  Ordinary  Course of  business  since the cut-off
            date of the respective  Stand-Alone  Financial  Statements,  or (ii)
            which are  subject  to  customary  retention  of title  arrangements

            Schedule 8.9.2,  the Owned Assets and Inventories are not encumbered
            with  any  Encumbrances  in  favor of any  Third  Party,  including,
            without  limitation,  Seller or Seller's  Affiliates  except for (i)
            retention  of title  rights,  liens,  pledges or security  rights in
            favor of landlords,  suppliers, mechanics, workmen, carriers and the
            like created by statutory  law or  contractual  obligations  (to the
            extent  that the  creation  of such Lien or  Encumbrance  is not the
            primary purpose of such  contract),  (ii) security rights granted to
            banks and other financial institutions under their general terms and
            conditions  (Allgemeine  Geschaftsbedingungen)  over cash, and other

            of third parties created by operation of law,  including pledges and
            other  security   rights  in  favor  of  tax  authorities  or  other
            governmental  entities,  and (iii)  easements and similar  rights in
            real property  which do not materially  impair the respective  Group
            Company's  ability to conduct  its  business  on the  relevant  real
            property as presently conducted.

8.9.3       Real Property.

            (i)   Disclosure  Schedule 8.9.3 (a) includes for each Group Company
                  a correct and  complete  list of all Owned Real  Property  and

                  Property. Except as set forth on Disclosure Schedule 8.9.3(a):
                  (i) the  Company  and the  Subsidiaries  have good,  valid and
                  marketable title to the Owned Real Property, free and clear of

            that  would  give rise to a  material  liability  against  any Group
            Companies  Benefit  Plan.  The  execution  of this  Agreement or the
            transactions contemplated thereby will not (i) entitle any employees
            of the Group  Companies  who are  employed  in the United  States to
            severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any  termination
            of employment  after the date hereof or (ii)  accelerate the time of
            payment or vesting  or result in any  payment or funding  (through a

            employee  of  the  Group  Companies  to  claims  against  the  Group
            Companies.

8.11.8      Except as disclosed  in  Disclosure  Schedule  8.11.8 no term in any
            employment   contract  or  service   agreement   provides  that  the
            consummation of this transaction  entitles any Key Employee to treat
            the change of control as a breach of the  contract or entitles  them
            to any payment or additional notice period or to treat themselves as
            redundant or otherwise dismissed or released from any obligation.

8.11.9      Except as disclosed in Disclosure  Schedule  8.11.9,  there exist no
            claims of the employees,  Key Employees,  former employees or former

            respects,  except for  Environmental  Permits which are  exclusively

            notice by any such authority that it intends to cancel,  withdraw or
            revoke any such Permit.

            material  respects in compliance  with the Permits in the respective
            jurisdictions of the Group Companies.  To the Seller's Knowledge, no
            Group Company has received any notice from a governmental  authority
            of any  failure  to comply  with the terms of any  Permit  except as
            disclosed  in  Disclosure   Schedule  8.12.2.  The   representations
            contained  in this  Section  8.12.2  shall  not apply to any laws or
            Permits  relating to intellectual  property rights or  Environmental
            Matters  and  Environmental  Laws  or Tax  matters  which  shall  be
            exclusively   provided   for  in   Sections   8.8,   12.2  and  13.2

8.12.3      Compliance  with Laws.  The Group  Companies  are and, to the extent

            have been  operated  in  compliance  with all  material  binding and
            mandatory  applicable  Regulations.  The guarantee contained in this
            Section  8.12.3  shall not apply to any laws or Permits  relating to
            intellectual   property  rights,   or   Environmental   Matters  and
            Environmental  Laws  or  Tax  matters  which  shall  be  exclusively
            provided for in Sections 8.8, 12.2 and 13.2 respectively. No product
            or service manufactured, sold, distributed or delivered by the Group
            Companies does or, to the extent that on or after the Closing Date a
            Third  Party  could  raise a claim,  did  contravene  or violate any
            Regulations.  Without  limiting  the  foregoing  none  of the  Group
            Companies (including any of their officers,  directors or employees)
            has,  directly or indirectly,  used any corporate funds for unlawful
            contributions,  gifts,  entertainment  or  other  unlawful  expenses
            relating to political  activity,  made,  offered or  authorized  any
            unlawful  payment to foreign or  domestic  government  officials  or
            governmental  employees,  whether  directly or indirectly,  or made,
            offered or authorized any unlawful bribe, rebate, payoff,  influence
            payment,   kickback  or  other  similar  unlawful  payment,  whether
            directly or indirectly,  in order to obtain or retain any businesses
            for the Group Companies  except for any of the foregoing which is no
            longer  subject to potential  claims of violation as a result of the
            expiration of the  applicable  statute of  limitations.  Each of the
            Group Companies has established the internal controls and procedures
            intended to ensure the compliance with applicable Regulations.

8.12.4      Subsidies.  Except as disclosed in Disclosure  Schedule  8.12.4,  no
            Group Company has received or applied for public grants (Zuschusse),
            allowances,   aids  (including  tax  benefits)  or  other  subsidies
            (Subventionen)  during a period of three  years prior to the Signing
            Date (collectively the "Public  Subsidies").  Except as disclosed in
            Disclosure Schedule 8.12.4, no competent  governmental authority has
            notified  any Group  Company  that it is obliged to repay in full or
            part any of the Public  Subsidies  received by it as a result of any
            failure by it to comply  with the terms and  conditions  of any such
            subsidy.

8.13        Product Liability.  Except as disclosed in Disclosure Schedule 8.13,
            there are no product or service  warranty  (including  claims due to
            late delivery), product liability (Produkthaftung) or similar claims
            pending or, to Seller's Knowledge, threatened

                                       44


            against any Group  Company and no Group  Company  has  received  any
            pending written order from any competent  governmental  authority or
            other  organization to recall any of the products  manufactured  and
            delivered by it.

            all insurance policies maintained relating to the assets, businesses
            or operations of the Group Companies.  All such policies are in full
            force and  effect  and  there  are no  claims  by any Group  Company
            pending  under any of such  policies as to which  coverage  has been
            questioned,  denied or disputed by the  insurer.  The  Purchaser  is
            aware  of the fact  that  such  policies  as far as they  have  been

            the Signing Date.

            there is no claim, action, suit,  litigation,  arbitration,  pending
            (nor,  to the  Seller's  Knowledge,  is any Third Party  pursuing an
            inquiry,  proceeding or  investigation)  and to Seller's  Knowledge,
            none have been threatened, either before court, arbitration tribunal
            or any governmental authority (gerichtliche Rechtsstreitigkeiten und
            Schiedsverfahren),    including   administrative    proceedings   or
            investigations  (Verwaltungsgerichts-  oder Verwaltungsverfahren) or

            respect to this Agreement and the  consummation of the  transactions
            contemplated hereby.

8.18        Private  Placement.  The Seller (a) is an  "accredited  investor" as
            defined  in Rule  501(a)  of  Regulation  D  promulgated  under  the
            Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  "Securities  Act"),  (b) is
            able to bear the economic  risk of losing its entire  investment  in
            the  Consideration  Shares,  and (c) has knowledge and experience in
            financial and business matters such that it is capable of evaluating
            the risks and merits of this  investment.  The  Seller  acknowledges
            that it is acquiring the  Consideration  Shares for its own account,
            and not with a view to any  distribution,  resale,  subdivision,  or
            fractionalization  thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any
            other applicable securities law, and the Seller has no present plans
            to enter into any contract,

<PAGE>
                                       46


            undertaking,  agreement or  arrangement  for any such  distribution,
            resale,  subdivision,  or  fractionalization  of  the  Consideration
            Shares. The Seller  acknowledges and agrees that, based in part upon
            its  guarantees  contained  herein and in reliance  upon  applicable
            exemptions,  the issuance of the Consideration Shares will not as of
            the  Closing  Date be  registered  under the  Securities  Act or the
            securities  laws  of any  jurisdiction  and  that  accordingly,  the
            Consideration Shares may not be offered for sale, sold, or otherwise
            transferred  in whole  or in part,  except  in  compliance  with all
            applicable laws, including securities laws.

            The certificate(s)  representing the Consideration Shares shall bear
            a legend stating in substance:

            THE  OFFERING  AND  SALE  OF  THE  SECURITIES  REPRESENTED  BY  THIS
            CERTIFICATE  HAVE NOT BEEN  REGISTERED  UNDER THE  SECURITIES ACT OF
            1933, AS AMENDED,  OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE. ANY TRANSFER
            OF SUCH SECURITIES WILL BE INVALID UNLESS AND UNTIL REGISTERED UNDER
            SAID  ACT  OR  SUCH  TRANSFER  IS  EXEMPT  FROM  REGISTRATION.   THE
            SECURITIES  REPRESENTED  BY THIS  CERTIFICATE  ARE ALSO  SUBJECT  TO
            LIMITATIONS  ON TRANSFER SET FORTH IN THE SHARE  PURCHASE  AGREEMENT
            DATED  DECEMBER 16,  2006, A COPY OF WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED  FROM THE
            ISSUER.

            Any subsequent  certificates  issued in respect of the Consideration
            Shares shall bear a similar  legend until removed as set forth below
            or  otherwise  removed in  accordance  with law.  Upon  request of a
            holder of  Consideration  Shares in connection with a public sale of
            such securities in compliance with applicable Regulations (including
            the  Securities  Act) or a sale  permitted  pursuant  to Rule 144(k)
            promulgated under the Securities Act, the Purchaser shall remove the
            first  sentence of the legend set forth above from the  certificates
            evidencing such securities or issue to such holder new  certificates
            therefore  free of such legend.  Upon any transfer of  Consideration
            Shares in compliance  with Section  15.4(ii)  hereof,  the Purchaser
            shall remove the second  sentence of the legend set forth above from
            this  certificate  evidencing  such  securities  or  issue  to  such
            transferee new certificates therefore free of such legend.

8.19        Accuracy  of  Information.  The Seller has not failed to disclose to
            the Purchaser  any material  facts  relating to the Group  Companies
            which are reasonably likely to have prevented a prudent business man
            from entering into this Agreement as notarized.

8.20        Seller's  Knowledge.  If and  to the  extent  this  Agreement  makes
            reference  to  "Seller's  Knowledge"  Seller shall be deemed to have
            knowledge of any facts or circumstances which the present members of
            the management board  (Vorstand) of the Seller,  the present members
            of the  management  board of the Company  and the persons  listed in
            Schedule 8.20 actually have as of the Signing Date after  reasonable
            inquiries or do not have due to gross negligence  (grob  fahrlassige
            Unkenntnis).

8.21        Materiality.  For the purposes of  calculating  any Breach or Losses
            (as defined below) the  qualification to materiality as contained in
            Section 8.12.3 and Section 12.2 shall be disregarded.

9.          Remedies for Breach of Guarantees

9.1         Breaches.  In the event that any of the statements made in Section 8
            is incorrect (a "Breach"),  the Seller shall put the Purchaser or at
            the  Purchaser's  own and free discretion any of the Group Companies
            into the  position  that it would have been in if the Breach had not
            occurred  (Naturalrestitution).  If and to the extent the Seller has
            not cured the Breach within a reasonable  time period,  but no later
            than  two  months  after  receipt  of a  Claim  Notice  (as  defined
            hereinafter) from the Purchaser,  or such restitution is impossible,
            or the Seller finally refuses  (verweigert  ernsthaft und endgultig)
            to make  restitution  in kind, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser
            the amount of any  Losses  which the  Purchaser  or any of the Group
            Companies has incurred or suffered as a result of the Breach. "Loss"
            or "Losses" are all damages  according to Section 249 et seqq.  BGB,
            excluding - except where  specifically  set forth  otherwise in this
            Agreement  - with  respect  to all claims  other  than  Third  Party
            Claims,  however,  consequential or indirect damages  (Folgeschaden,
            mittelbare Schaden) and loss of profits (entgangener Gewinn). Except
            where specifically set forth otherwise in this Agreement,  a Loss or
            Losses  relating  to all  claims the  Purchaser  may have under this
            Agreement (including Third Party Claims) shall in no event encompass
            income taxes  payable as a result of any  indemnity or other payment
            or other  compensation,  loss of  prospective  business,  loss of or
            damage to reputation, frustrated expenses (vergebliche Aufwendungen)
            within the meaning of Section 284 BGB, internal  administration  and
            overhead costs or any losses based on the argument that the purchase
            price  for the  Shares  was  calculated  on the  basis of  incorrect
            assumptions or information.  Any Losses shall be computed net of any
            related present or future advantages and benefits (including avoided
            losses,  tax benefits and savings  directly  related to the relevant
            matter (Vorteilsausgleich)).

9.2         Notification,  Investigation  and  Cooperation.  The Purchaser shall
            notify the Seller in writing of any Breach  within  twenty  Business
            Days after it becomes  aware of the facts  believed to  constitute a
            Breach,  stating in  reasonable  detail the nature  thereof  and the
            estimated amount involved (the "Claim Notice");  provided,  however,
            that the  failure  or delay of the  Purchaser  to  provide  any such
            written  notice  shall not limit the  Purchaser's  right to  recover
            Losses except to the extent such failure or delay is  prejudicial to
            the defense of such claim.  The Purchaser shall give the Seller such
            information  and assistance,  as the Seller or its advisors  request
            for the purpose of investigating  the matter or circumstance  giving
            rise to such Breach.  The  Purchaser  shall take and shall cause the
            respective Group Company to take all steps which the Seller requests
            from the Purchaser for the purpose of any remedial action. If and to
            the extent a claim under Section 8 exists,  all reasonable costs and
            expenses  incurred by the Purchaser shall be borne by the Seller; if
            and to the extent a claim under Section 8 does not exist,  all costs
            and expenses incurred by the Seller shall be borne by the Purchaser.

9.3         Third Party Claims. If the Purchaser  discovers that any Third Party
            including  any   governmental   authority   takes  or  threatens  by
            notification  in writing to take any action which may give rise to a
            claim under Section 8 (the "Third Party Claim"), the

<PAGE>
                                       48


            Purchaser  shall notify the Seller  within 20 Business Days after it
            becomes aware  thereof  about any such Third Party Claim;  provided,
            however,  that the failure or delay of the  Purchaser to provide any
            such written notice shall not limit the Purchaser's right to recover
            Losses except if such failure or delay is prejudicial to the defense
            of such Third Party Claim.

9.3.1       Seller shall have the right to defend and control the defense of the
            Third Party Claim with  counsel of its own choice;  in such case the
            Purchaser  shall have the right to be  represented by counsel of its
            choice and to attend the  defense of the Third Party Claim for which
            it seeks indemnity from the Seller at its own expense. The Purchaser
            shall not, and shall cause the Group  Companies not to,  compromise,
            dispose of or settle any Third Party  Claim or assume any  liability
            in connection  with any Third Party Claim without the Seller's prior
            written consent (which may not unreasonably be withheld).  No action
            by the Seller or its  representatives in connection with the defense
            shall be construed as an acknowledgment (whether express or implied)
            of  the  Purchaser's  Claim  (as  defined  below)  or of  any  facts
            underlying or related to such claim.  If the Seller elects to defend
            and control  the  defense of the Third Party Claim the Seller  shall
            indemnify the  Purchaser,  or at Purchaser's  discretion,  the Group
            Companies  accordingly  pursuant  to this  Section  9 for  the  Loss
            suffered  by  the  Group  Companies  and  shall  hold  harmless  the
            Purchaser or, at Purchaser's  discretion,  the Group  Companies from
            any Third Party Claim.  The Seller shall not compromise,  dispose of
            or settle any Third Party Claim  without  Purchaser's  prior written
            consent  (which  may  not   unreasonably   be  withheld),   if  such
            compromise,  disposition  or  settlement  would  provide  any remedy
            against  Purchaser or Purchaser's  Affiliates other than the payment
            of monetary damages.

9.3.2       If Seller  does not assume the  defense of such Third  Party  Claim,
            Purchaser may assume such defense with counsel of its own choice; in
            such case the Seller may elect to  participate in the defense of any
            such Third Party Claim for which indemnity is sought with counsel of
            its choice at its own expense.  The  Purchaser  shall not, and shall
            cause the Group Companies not to,  compromise,  dispose of or settle
            any Third Party Claim or assume any liability in connection with any
            Third Party Claim without the Seller's prior written  consent (which
            may not unreasonably be withheld).

9.3.3       In the event the  Seller  elects  to  assume or  participate  in the
            defense of a Third Party Claim, the Purchaser shall, and shall cause
            Group Companies to fully cooperate with the Seller in the defense of
            any Third Party Claim.  The Purchaser in particular  shall  provide,
            and shall cause the Group Companies to provide, the Seller with such
            information  and  assistance  as  the  Seller  or its  advisors  may
            reasonably  request  to  investigate  or to defend  the Third  Party
            Claim.

9.3.4       If and to the extent a claim  under  Section 8 exists and  Purchaser
            assumes the defense thereof as provided above,  all reasonable costs
            and expenses  incurred by the  Purchaser  in such  defense  shall be
            borne by the Seller.

9.4         Exclusion  of  Liability.  The  Seller  shall not be liable  for any
            Breach,  and the Purchaser  shall not be entitled to bring any claim
            under  Section 8  against  the  Seller  (individually  a "Claim"  or
            collectively "Claims"), if and to the extent that:

                                       49


9.4.1       the underlying facts, circumstances, and events forming the basis of
            a Claim (anspruchsbegrundende Umstande gema(beta) ss. 199 Abs. 1 Nr.
            2 BGB)  have  been  specifically  disclosed  in  Section  8 and  its
            Disclosure  Schedules  or in the  Exhibits  to  this  Agreement,  or
            appropriately  cross  referenced  in  the  Disclosure  Schedules  or
            Exhibits. Section 442 BGB and Section 377 HGB shall be excluded with
            respect to any facts not so disclosed;

9.4.2       the amount of the Claim has been  reimbursed  from a Third  Party or
            under any insurance policy. Provided, however, the Purchaser and the
            Seller  shall  discuss  in good  faith  whether  it is  commercially
            reasonable to seek  reimbursement  under any insurance policy of the
            Purchaser or any Group Company taking into account the  compensation
            for Losses by Seller and the eventual increase in insurance premiums
            caused by such reimbursement; or

9.4.3       the  Purchaser  or  any  of  its  Affiliates  including  Purchaser's
            Guarantor  and,  after the Closing Date,  the Group  Companies  (but
            excluding HT or any other  Affiliates  of HT, but  including for the
            avoidance of doubt Purchaser's Guarantor),  or after the Closing any
            of the Group Companies,  has caused (verursacht oder  mitverursacht)
            such Claim or failed to  mitigate  damages  pursuant  to Section 254
            BGB; or

9.4.4       the matter to which the Claim relates has been taken into account in
            the calculation of the Closing Date Net Cash.

9.5         De Minimis and Threshold. The Seller shall only be liable for Claims
            if (i) the actual  individual  Claim  exceeds EUR 150,000 (in words:
            Euro one hundred fifty thousand) (the "De Minimis Amount"), and (ii)
            the aggregate  amount with respect to all actual  Claims  (excluding
            claims which do not exceed the De Minimis  Amount in the  individual
            case)  exceeds EUR  3,000,000  (in words:  Euro three  million) (the
            "Threshold") in which case the Seller shall be liable for the entire
            amount  (Freigrenze).  Serial or related  claims shall be deemed one
            individual Claim.

9.6         Maximum  Liability.  Subject  to  claims  under  the  Tax  indemnity
            pursuant to Section 13 below  which shall be uncapped  and shall not
            be applied against the liability cap stated in this Section 9.6, the
            maximum  liability of the Seller for all claims  Purchaser  may have
            under this Agreement  shall be limited to USD 250,000,000 (in words:
            US Dollars two hundred fifty  million)  except for Claims  resulting
            from a Breach of Seller  pursuant  to Section  8.1 and 8.2 for which
            the maximum  liability of the Seller  (including  all other  Claims)
            shall be  limited  to the  Purchase  Price to the extent it has been
            received by the Seller.

9.7         Limitation Period. If not otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all
            Claims shall be time-barred (verjahren) after the lapse of 24 months
            from and  including  the Closing Date except for Claims  pursuant to
            Section  8.1 and 8.5 which  shall be  time-barred  5 years after the
            Closing  Date and Claims  pursuant to Section  8.12.3 which shall be
            time-barred 3 years after the Closing Date.

9.8         Suspension of Limitation.  The limitation period for each individual
            Claim shall only be suspended  (gehemmt) in accordance  with Section
            209 BGB by a timely  notification  of the Seller for such individual
            claim pursuant to Section 9.2, provided that the Purchaser initiates
            a  court  proceeding  within  three  months  after  receipt  of  the
            notification by the Seller. Section 203 BGB shall not apply.

9.9         No further  Rights or other  Guarantees.  The Parties agree that the
            rights and remedies  which the Purchaser may have against the Seller
            for a Breach  or any  other  breach  of any  obligation  under  this
            Agreement shall be exclusively  governed by this  Agreement.  Except
            for claims for specific performance  (primare  Erfullungspflichten),
            all  rights,  claims  and  remedies  of any legal  nature  which the
            Parties may  otherwise  have against each other in  connection  with
            this  Agreement or the  transaction  contemplated  by this Agreement
            shall be  excluded to the extent such  exclusion  is possible  under
            applicable  mandatory laws,  provided,  however,  that Purchaser may
            seek the monetary  compensation  of Losses  (including  in this case
            consequential  damages,  indirect  damages and lost profits) in case
            the Seller has not complied with its  obligation (i) to transfer the
            Shares and hereby  breached  its  obligations  in Sections  7.1.1(x)
            through  7.1.1(xv),  7.1.3,  7.2.1  second last  sentence,  7.2.3 or
            7.2.4,  (ii) to comply with the covenants set forth in Section 15.1,
            15.4, 16, 17 or 18.1. The right to withdraw  (zurucktreten) from, or
            otherwise terminate,  this Agreement or to require the winding up of
            the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  any claims for
            breach  of   pre-contractual   obligations  (culpa  in  contrahendo)
            including  claims under  Sections 241 para.  (2), 311 para.  (2) and
            para (3) BGB,  any  claims for  breach of  contract  (Schadensersatz
            wegen  Pflichtverletzung)  including  claims under Sections 280, 282
            BGB,  any claims  based on  frustration  of  contract  (Storung  der
            Geschaftsgrundlage)  including  claims  under  Section 313 BGB,  any
            claims of the Purchaser for defects of the Shares or the business of
            the Company under Sections 437 to 441 BGB, and any claims under tort
            including  claims under Sections 823 et seq. BGB,  except for claims
            for  wilful  deceit  (arglistige  Tauschung)  or  other  intentional
            breaches of contract (vorsatzliche  Vertragsverletzungen),  shall be
            excluded.  Subject  to the  provisions  of  Section 8 the  Purchaser
            agrees to acquire the Company,  the  Subsidiaries and their business
            in the  condition  they are on the  Signing  Date and on the Closing
            Date,  respectively,  without reliance upon any expressed or implied
            representations,  warranties  or guarantees of any nature made by or
            on behalf of or  imputed to the  Seller  except for the  independent
            guarantees set out in Section 8.

            Without  limiting the  generality  of the  foregoing,  the Purchaser
            acknowledges  that the Seller gives no guarantee,  representation or
            warranty with respect to (i) any  projections,  estimates or budgets
            delivered  or made  available to the  Purchaser of future  revenues,
            future  results of  operations  (or any  component  thereof)  or the
            future  business and  operations  of the Group  Companies,  (ii) any
            other  information  or documents  made available to the Purchaser or
            its  counsel,  accountants  or  advisors  with  respect to the Group
            Companies, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.

9.10        No third party Rights. No provision of this Agreement  constitutes a
            contract  for the  benefit of a third  party  within the  meaning of
            Section 328 BGB or otherwise  (kein Vertrag  zugunsten  Dritter oder
            mit Schutzwirkung zugunsten Dritter), irrespective of

<PAGE>
                                       51


            whether any payment under this  Agreement is made to the  Purchaser,
            the Company or a Subsidiary.

9.11        Threshold Test; Payments. In case the Purchaser asserts a Claim in a
            currency other than Euros, the procedures set forth in Section 4.1.3
            shall be applied (including, without limitation, with respect to the
            calculation  of their amounts in relation to the De Minimis  Amount,
            the Threshold or the maximum liability under Section 9.6) as per the
            date the Purchaser  submits the Claim Notice or, as the case may be,
            the  notification of a Third Party Claim. Any payments by the Seller
            under  this  Agreement  shall be made in Euros  unless  the Loss has
            occurred in another currency in which case the payment shall be made
            in this  currency.  Any  payments  made by the  Seller to  Purchaser
            hereunder  including  pursuant  to  Sections  7.1.8  and 10.2  shall
            constitute a reduction of the Purchase Price. Any payments  received
            by the Seller according to Section 11 or 13 (e.g. Tax Refunds) shall
            constitute an increase of the Purchase Price paid to the Seller.

            government  (including  officials and  employees of any  department,

            such unlawful payments and (h) any and all attorneys fees related to
            the foregoing,  (ii) exclude any damages  suffered from the negative
            impact of such  payments  referred to in sentence 1 of this  Section
            10.2 on  reputation  or the  development  of the share  price of the

            defined in Section 10.5 below)  incurred in connection with warranty
            claims,  product liability claims, claims for late delivery or other
            liabilities  arising under  contracts by which products of the Group

            of or in connection with agreements on the sale or other disposal of
            Interests listed in Exhibit 10.4.

10.5        Limitations.  Claims  under this Section 10 shall be  time-barred  7

            sentence,  9.5 and  9.7,  provided  that  notification  pursuant  to
            Section  9.2  or  9.3  shall  not  be  required   with   respect  to
            circumstances   disclosed  in  the   Disclosure   Schedules   (which

            a maximum amount of EUR 10 million

            (i)   incurred due to compliance  with the obligation to operate the
                  sites in Lunen,  Hamm and Wuppertal in accordance  with Art. 4
                  first  sentence of the  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  (as
                  defined and  referred to in Section 15.2 hereof) to the extent
                  such Losses had not been incurred absent such  compliance,  or
                  (ii) in connection  with an  integration of the Hamm operation
                  into the Lunen site,  provided that the determination  whether
                  and to what

<PAGE>
                                       53


                  extent  such Losses  have been  incurred  shall be made by the
                  Supervisory  Board of the Company with binding  effect for the
                  Parties hereto, or

            (ii)  resulting from a CBA Conflict. A "CBA Conflict" shall exist if
                  and  to  the  extent  the  Purchaser,  the  Company  or DBS is
                  prohibited,  in whole or in part,  from utilizing or receiving
                  the full  benefit  of the  rules  set out in,  and  using  the
                  flexibility  allowed  for  under,  the  Collective  Bargaining
                  Agreement   referred  to  in  Section   15.2  because  of  the
                  applicability   or   application   of  any  other   collective
                  bargaining  agreement,  works  agreement or similar  agreement
                  which is applicable  individually to the Company or DBS (i.e.,
                  with the  exception of Flachen-  oder  Manteltarifvertrage  or
                  similar  agreements)  (e.g.,  if upon  exercise of the special
                  termination  right under the Collective  Bargaining  Agreement
                  referred  to in  Section  15.2  workforce  reductions  or site
                  closures in the Company or DBS were restricted  because of the
                  application  of the  existing  "Zukunftsvereinbarung"  for the
                  Company  dated April 20, 2005  entered  into  between the same
                  parties  that  have   concluded  the   Collective   Bargaining
                  Agreement).

10.7        Non  Disclosure/Access  to  Information.  Other than as  required by
            applicable Regulation  (including court order),  between the Signing

            this  Agreement  (including  Section  10.2).  With  respect  to  the
            preceding  two  sentences  such  obligations   shall  apply  mutatis

            are  required   under   Environmental   Law  or  by  an  Enforceable
            Administrative  Notice,  or there is a valid  business  reason other

            or any of the Group  Companies  conduct  any kind of  investigation,

            interviews and the mere visual inspection of the surface of the soil
            without any kind of drilling  or opening of the soil,  unless  being
            required  to do so  under  Environmental  Law  or by an  Enforceable
            Administrative  Notice,  or there is a valid  business  reason other

            to  (iii)  provided  that the  Seller's  liability  shall  not so be
            limited,  if  Environmental  Matters  occur  or  are  identified  in
            connection  with  expansion,  construction,  repair,  maintenance or
            replacement  activities  undertaken  by  the  Purchaser  or  by  the
            relevant  Group  Company  after the  Closing  Date which do not fall
            within the scope of (i) and the  Environmental  Loss  claimed by the
            Purchaser  results from  obligations  of the  Purchaser or the Group

            will,  and will use  reasonable  efforts to cause the relevant Group
            Company to,  consider,  after good faith  discussions  with  Seller,

12.6        Indemnification  Procedures.  If the  Purchaser  or any of the Group
            Companies  becomes  aware of any  facts  which  may give  rise to an
            indemnification  claim with respect to any Environmental Matter, the
            Purchaser  shall  promptly,  but in no event  later  than  within 20
            Business Days,  inform the Seller thereof in accordance with Section
            9.2 and Section 9.3, provided, however, that the failure or delay of
            the Purchaser to provide any such written notice shall not limit the
            Purchaser's  right to  recover  Losses  except  to the  extent  such
            failure or delay is  prejudicial  to the defense of such Third Party
            Claim.  Section 9.2 shall apply mutatis mutandis.  Section 9.3 shall
            apply  to the  defense  against  any  actions,  claims,  demands  or

            governmental  authority).  In addition,  (i) the Seller shall on its
            own  costs be  entitled  to retain  any  environmental  experts  and
            consultants  other than those  retained  by the Group  Companies  in
            connection with any such Environmental Matter and (ii) the Purchaser
            shall give the Seller and any  environmental  expert retained by the
            Seller the opportunity to investigate any property owned or occupied
            by the Purchaser or any Group Company  (including the taking of soil
            samples)   during   ordinary   business   hours   after   reasonable
            notification.   Provided,   however,  such  investigation  does  not
            unreasonably interfere with the operation of any property and Seller
            indemnifies   Purchaser   for  any  damage  or  injury  by  Seller's
            investigation,  and, Purchaser has the legal authority to allow such
            investigation  on Property it does not own,  and  provided  further,
            that any remedial action shall be controlled by the Purchaser or the
            relevant Group Company. The Purchaser shall assure that the relevant
            Group  Company  will  comply  with the terms and  conditions  of any
            existing agreements as set forth in Disclosure Schedule 12.6 between
            any entities of the Seller's Group and the Group Companies  relating
            to  the  clean-up,  indemnification  procedures  or  cooperation  in
            connection with any Environmental Matter.

            expressly  set forth in this  Section 12, no  Environmental  Matters
            shall give rise to any claims by the  Purchaser or any Group Company
            against any member of the  Seller's  Group  based on whatever  legal
            reason.  Any  claims  pursuant  to  Section  24 para.  (2)  BBodSchG
            (Bundes-Bodenschutzgesetz)  and any similar  statutory  claims under
            the laws of any other  jurisdiction  relating  to any  Environmental
            Matter shall be excluded

12.7.2      The Purchaser  shall  indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its
            legal successors  subject to a maximum limitation period of 12 years
            from the Closing Date,  from any  liability,  all costs and expenses
            and all other damages and losses related to any Environmental Matter
            with  respect  to  the  Group  Companies,  their  business  and  the
            properties and assets owned or used by it at any time, except and to
            the extent that the Seller is required to  indemnify  the  Purchaser
            with respect to the relevant  Environmental  Matter pursuant to this
            Section  12.  Sections  12.1,  12.3 and  12.6  shall  apply  mutatis
            mutandis.

            the  Seller   pursuant  to  Section   12.3  (i)  in  the  event  the
            administrative  notice is revoked by the authorities or overruled by
            a court decision  after the Seller has  indemnified or held harmless
            the  Purchaser or the relevant  Group  Company,  in each case to the
            extent  the   Seller  is  not   otherwise   obligated   to  pay  the
            Environmental  Loss suffered by the Purchaser or the Group Companies
            and to  the  extent  the  Environmental  Loss  is  recovered  by the
            Purchaser or the Group Companies.  Seller's claim to rebate shall be
            time-barred 1 (one) year after the administrative  notice has become
            legally  binding,  been  revoked  by the  authorities  or  has  been
            overruled by a legally binding court decision.

12.7.4      Section 9.8 shall apply mutatis mutandis.

13.1.2      Allocations in Respect of Straddle Tax Periods. For purposes of this
            Section 13:

            Any  reference  to an amount of income or loss  attributable  to the
            pre-Closing  portion  of a Straddle  Tax Period  means the amount of
            income or loss  actually  earned or  incurred  during the portion of
            such Straddle Tax Period  ending on the Closing Date,  determined on
            the basis of a closing of the books of the affected Group Company as
            of the close of business on the Closing Date;

            Any  reference  to an amount of income or loss  attributable  to the
            post-Closing portion of a Straddle Tax Period means the total amount
            of income or loss  earned  or  incurred  during  that  Straddle  Tax
            Period,  minus the  amount of  income  or loss  attributable  to the
            pre-Closing  portion of that  Straddle Tax Period under the rules of
            this Section 13.1.2;

            Any reference to an amount of Indemnifiable  Tax attributable to the
            pre-Closing or  post-Closing  portion of a Straddle Tax Period means
            the  Indemnifiable  Tax that would have been payable with respect to
            the income  attributable to that portion of the Straddle Tax Period,
            determined  as if  such  portion  were a  separate  period  for  the
            assessment of such Indemnifiable Tax; and

            Any reference to an amount of credit attributable to the pre-Closing
            or post-Closing portion of a Straddle Tax Period means the amount of
            credit that would have been  allowable  with respect to that portion
            of the  Straddle  Tax Period,  determined  as if such portion were a
            separate  period  for the  assessment  of any  relevant  Tax and the
            income or loss for such period,  and the  Indemnifiable  Tax payable
            with  respect  to  such   period,   were  the  income  or  loss  and
            Indemnifiable  Tax  attributable to that portion of the Straddle Tax
            Period under the rules of this Section 13.1.2.

            For  the   avoidance  of  doubt,   the  amount  of  income  or  loss
            attributable to a pre-Closing or post-Closing  portion of a Straddle
            Tax Period is determined strictly on a  closing-of-the-books  basis,
            and is not limited by the  existence or amount of overall  income or
            loss earned or incurred by the relevant Group Company for the entire
            Straddle Tax Period.

13.2        Tax Guarantee. The Seller guarantees to the Purchaser in the form of
            independent  guarantees (as further set forth in the introduction to
            Section  8)  that,  as of  the  date  hereof,  except  as  otherwise
            disclosed in accordance with Section 9.4.1,

            prior to the date hereof with  respect to any  Pre-Closing  Date Tax
            Period  by or on behalf of the  Seller or the Group  Companies  have
            been filed on a timely  basis  taking  into  account  any  permitted
            extension;

13.2.2      the  Seller and the  Companies  have  timely  paid (if  required  by
            applicable  law) all Taxes shown as payable by them (i) on any valid
            and  enforceable  Tax assessment  notice issued by any Tax Authority
            other  than  Taxes  contested  in good  faith  that are  listed  and
            described in  Disclosure  Schedule  13.2.2 or (ii) on any Tax Return
            filed by them with any Tax Authority; and

13.2.3      neither  the Seller nor any  Company is involved in any Tax audit or
            investigation  (other than regular Tax audits in the Ordinary Course
            of business, such as the routine Betriebsprufungen in Germany) as of
            the Signing Date.  Between the Signing Date and the Closing Date the
            Seller will notify  without  undue delay the  Purchaser of any audit
            with  respect to a Group  Company  taking  place or being  announced
            after the Signing Date.

13.3        Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Tax.

13.3.1      In the period  between  the date hereof and the  Closing  Date,  the
            Seller  shall  prepare and file,  and cause the Group  Companies  to
            prepare  and  file,  all Tax  Returns  required  to be  filed  on an
            individual or  consolidated  basis by or on behalf of any of them on
            or before the  Closing  Date and shall  timely  pay,  or cause to be
            timely paid, all Taxes payable under such Tax Returns.

13.3.2      After the Closing  Date,  the  Purchaser  shall prepare and file, or
            cause to be prepared and filed, when due all Tax Returns required to
            be filed on an individual or  consolidated  basis by or on behalf of
            the  Purchaser or the Group  Companies  that need not be prepared or
            filed  by the  Seller,  provided,  however,  that  any  Tax  Returns
            relating in whole or in part to any  Pre-Closing  Date Tax Period or
            Straddle Tax Period shall be subject to the review and prior written
            consent of the  Seller.  The  Purchaser  shall  ensure  that any Tax
            Returns to be reviewed  and approved by the Seller will be furnished
            to the  Seller  not later  than 30 days prior to the due date of the
            relevant  Tax  Return  and that all  Taxes  payable  under  such Tax
            Returns  shall be timely  paid.  The Seller  shall be deemed to have
            given its consent to any Tax Return  timely  furnished to it for its
            review if it had failed to review such Tax Return and to provide its
            comments to the Purchaser or the relevant  Group Company  within two
            weeks following the receipt (Zugang) thereof.

13.3.3      With   respect  to  the  VAT  tax   integration   (umsatzsteuerliche
            Organschaft) between the Company and the Seller, the Purchaser shall
            procure  that  the  Seller  will  promptly   receive   invoices  (in
            accordance  with  Section 14 UStG for any  deliveries  and  services
            provided,  but not yet invoiced, to the Company prior to the Closing
            Date. Any VAT reimbursement  claims  (Vorsteuererstattungsanspruche)
            in  connection  with such  deliveries  and  services,  including any
            subsequent  corrections  thereof,  shall be for the  account  of the
            Seller or the  respective  shareholder  of the Seller (in accordance
            with applicable law). Any VAT  (Umsatzsteuerzahllast  - equal to the
            balance  between VAT owed to the tax authorities and deductible VAT)
            payable by the Seller (or by the relevant  shareholder of the Seller
            as a result of the VAT tax integration) with respect to the relevant
            calendar  months  preceding  the Closing  Date shall be borne by the
            Seller. The Purchaser shall promptly notify the Seller of any matter
            relevant in connection with this Section 13.3.3.

13.4        Tax Covenants of Purchaser.  The Purchaser  shall indemnify and hold
            harmless the Seller with respect to any Taxes imposed on the Seller,
            and shall forego any indemnification under Section 13.6 with respect
            to Taxes  imposed on the Group  Companies,  to the extent such Taxes
            would not have been imposed but for any action

<PAGE>
                                       66


            taken by the  Purchaser  or any of the  Group  Companies  after  the
            Closing  Date  (including  any  change  in the  exercise  of any Tax
            election  right,  the  amendment  of any Tax Return  other than as a
            result (Folgewirkung) of a tax audit, the termination of any control
            or  profit  transfer  agreement  or tax  consolidation  scheme,  the
            implementation of any acquisition  structure in connection with this
            Agreement or the approval or implementation of any restructuring).

13.5        Tax Refunds.  In the event that the  Purchaser or any Group  Company
            receives a Tax Refund after the Closing Date,  the  Purchaser  shall
            pay to the Seller as an additional portion of the Purchase Price the
            aggregate  portions  of such Tax  Refund  that are (i)  received  in
            respect  of Taxes paid for any  Pre-Closing  Date Tax Period or (ii)
            received  in respect of Taxes paid for any  Straddle  Tax Period and
            attributable to the pre-Closing portion of that Straddle Tax Period.
            The  Purchaser  shall  promptly  notify the Seller in writing of the
            receipt  of the  Tax  Refund  or the  relevant  decision  by the Tax
            Authority. Any amount payable to the Seller pursuant to this Section
            13.5 shall be due and payable within fifteen Business Days after the
            Tax Refund has been received by the Purchaser or the relevant  Group
            Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Purchaser shall not be
            required to make any payment to Seller in respect of a Tax Refund to
            the extent (i) the Tax Refund was reflected as a receivable or other
            asset in the Stand-Alone Financial  Statements,  (ii) the Tax Refund
            is in  respect  of Taxes paid by the  Purchaser  or a Group  Company
            after  the  Closing  Date that  have not been  reimbursed  by Seller
            pursuant to Section 13.6,  (iii) the Tax Refund is  attributable  to
            the  carryback  of  a  loss  or  credit  realized  in  respect  of a
            Post-Closing  Effective  Date Tax Period,  or (iv) the Tax Refund is
            attributable  to the  portion  of a  carryback  of a loss or  credit
            realized in respect of a Straddle Tax Period that is attributable to
            the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Tax Period.

13.6        Tax Indemnification.

13.6.1      Subject  to the  provisions  contained  in  this  Section  13 and in
            Section  9.4.4 and 9.10,  the Seller  shall pay to the  Purchaser an
            amount equal to (i) any  liability  for Taxes  incurred by any Group
            Company arising from a breach of a Tax  representation  contained in
            Section  13.2,  (ii) any  Indemnifiable  Tax  payable  by any  Group
            Company with respect to any  Pre-Closing  Date Tax Period,  (iii) an
            amount  equal  to  any   Indemnifiable   Tax   attributable  to  the
            pre-Closing  portion  of  any  Straddle  Tax  Period  and  (iv)  any
            liability for real estate transfer tax incurred by any Group Company
            or the Purchaser and attributable to transactions taking place on or
            before the Closing Date  (including the execution of this Agreement)
            relating to or affecting the Lunen  property  ((i),  (ii),(iii)  and
            (iv) each referred to herein as a "Tax Loss"). Such  indemnification
            obligation  of  Seller  shall be  reduced  by the  amount of any Tax
            Saving related to the relevant breach or Indemnifiable Tax. However,
            such  indemnification  obligation  of  Seller  shall  be  determined
            without  regard  to  any  reduction  of  Tax  resulting  from  (i) a
            carryback of a loss or credit from a Post-Closing Date Tax Period or
            (ii)  the  portion  of any  carryback  or a loss  or  credit  from a
            Straddle Tax Period that is attributable to the post-Closing portion
            of  the  Straddle  Tax  Period,   and  the  amount  of  any  Tax  or
            Indemnifiable  Tax  payable or deemed  payable by any Group  Company
            shall be deemed, for purposes of this Section 13.6, to be the amount

<PAGE>
                                       67


            of such Tax or Indemnifiable Tax that would have been payable in the
            absence of such carryback of a loss or credit.

13.6.2      The Seller  shall not be liable for any Tax Loss that would not have
            been incurred but for the Purchaser's breach of any Tax Covenant set
            out in Section 13.4 (without prejudice to any other rights of Seller
            arising from the breach).

13.7        Limitation  Period. Any claims of the Seller and the Purchaser under
            this Section 13 shall be time-barred  upon expiration of the earlier
            of (i) a limitation period of three months after the  non-appealable
            binding  assessment  (e.g.  bestandskraftige   Festsetzung)  of  the
            relevant Tax or (ii) the regular statutory limitation period for the
            relevant Tax. Section 9.8 shall apply  accordingly.  Notwithstanding
            the above,  the Seller's  rights under Section 13.4 and Section 13.5
            shall be subject to the applicable statutory limitation period.

13.8        Indemnification Procedures.

13.8.1      If, after the Closing,  any Tax  Authority  informs the Purchaser or
            any of the Group Companies of a proposed audit, assessment,  dispute
            or other circumstance  relating to any Tax with respect to which the
            Seller may incur any liability under this  Agreement,  the Purchaser
            shall notify the Seller of such matter. The Purchaser's notice shall
            be given  within  ten  Business  Days  after  the  Purchaser  or the
            relevant  Group Company has received the relevant  information  from
            the Tax Authority,  or at any earlier date if required to enable the
            Seller to participate in any Tax audit or to review the relevant Tax
            assessment  within the applicable  period available for an appeal or
            other legal remedy.

13.8.2      The Purchaser  agrees,  and shall cause the relevant  Group Company,
            (i) to give the Seller the opportunity to participate in any audits,
            disputes,  administrative,  judicial or other proceedings related to
            any Tax for any  Pre-Closing  Date Tax Period or Straddle Tax Period
            that could give rise to a Seller  indemnification  obligation  under
            Section  13.6,  (ii) upon the Seller's  request,  to  challenge  and
            litigate any Tax  assessment or other  decision of any Tax Authority
            related to such Tax,  provided  that Seller  shall bear all internal
            and external  costs of Purchaser  and any Group Company with respect
            to such challenge and litigation and (iii) to comply with reasonable
            instructions  given by the Seller in  relation to the conduct of the
            proceedings  referred  in (i) and (ii)  above.  This shall  include,
            without  limitation,  the Seller's right to determine whether or not
            any Company will  participate in any Tax amnesty with respect to any
            Indemnifiable  Tax. In all other respects,  Sections 9.3 shall apply
            to the defense against any assessments or proceedings related to any
            Tax for any Pre-Closing Date Tax Period or Straddle Tax Period.

13.9        Cooperation  on Tax  Matters.  Subject to the  Parties'  obligations
            pursuant  to the other  provisions  of this  Section 13, the Parties
            shall fully  cooperate,  and shall cause  their  representatives  to
            fully  cooperate,  at their own cost,  with each other in connection
            with all Tax matters  relating to any  Pre-Closing  Date Tax Period,
            including  the  preparation  and  filing  of any Tax  Return  or the
            conducting  of any  audit,  investigation,  dispute or appeal or any
            other communication with any Tax Authority. Cooperation

            between the Parties  shall include (but shall not be limited to) the
            providing  and  making  available  by the  Purchaser,  of all books,
            records  and  information,   the  assistance  of  all  officers  and
            employees  of the Group  Companies  and the making  available by the
            Purchaser or the Group  Companies of any premises for the purpose of
            any Tax audit of the Seller,  to the extent  necessary  or useful in
            connection  with such Tax matters.  The Parties  shall  further make
            available  to any Tax  Authority,  to the extent  required by law or
            requested  by  any  Tax  Authority,  all  information,  records  and
            documents  relating to Tax  liabilities or potential Tax liabilities
            for all periods prior to or on the Closing  Date,  including the Tax
            treatment and Tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby,
            and all  materials  of any kind  (including  opinions  or other  Tax
            Analysis)  that are provided to the Parties  relating  thereto,  and
            shall preserve all relevant information, records and documents until
            the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations or extension
            thereof. The furnishing by the Purchaser or any Group Company to any
            Tax Authority of any  information  related to the Group Companies in
            connection  with any Tax  audit  shall  require  the  prior  written
            consent of the Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

13.10       With effect of December 31, 2006 all tax allocation agreements shall
            be terminated.  After  December 31, 2006 no tax  allocation  charges
            (Steuerumlagen)  will be made between  Seller and the Company unless
            provided for in the Company 2006 Financial  Statements.  The Parties
            indemnify each other against any such payments.

14.         Profit and Loss Transfer Agreement; Guarantees; Derivative Contracts

14.1        Profit  and Loss  Transfer  Agreement.  The  Parties  agree that the
            Profit  and Loss  Transfer  Agreement  between  the  Seller  and the
            Company  will be  terminated  on and with effect as of December  31,
            2006,  24.00  hours.  The Company  shall  transfer to the Seller any
            profit and the Seller shall  compensate the Company for any loss, in
            each case  generated in the period  commenced on January 1, 2006 and
            ending on  December  31, 2006 as shown in the  individual  financial
            statements  of the  Company as of  December  31,  2006,  prepared in
            accordance  with  German  GAAP (HGB) (the  "Company  2006  Financial
            Statements")  in  accordance  with the terms and  conditions of such
            agreement.  The  Parties  agree that the Seller  shall  prepare  the
            Company 2006  Financial  Statements.  To the extent the Company 2006
            Financial  Statements show an obligation to transfer  profits to the
            Seller,  such  transfer  shall be made by the  Company  prior to the
            Closing  Date; to the extent the Company 2006  Financial  Statements
            show  an  obligation  to  compensate  a loss,  such  loss  shall  be
            compensated by Seller to the Company prior to the Closing Date.

14.2        Indemnification.  The  Parties  agree  and shall  procure  that upon
            payment of the profit  transfer or loss  compensation  in accordance
            with Section 14.1, all rights and obligations between the Seller and
            the Company related to any profit and loss transfer shall be finally
            settled  and  that  the  Company's  financial  statements  as of any
            previous  financial  year end shall not be challenged by the Parties
            or by or on behalf of the Company after the Closing  Date.  However,
            this shall not prevent  management of the Company to claim  payments
            from the Seller,  or the Seller to claim  payments from the Company,
            in each case if and to the  extent  this would be  required  by law.
            Subject to the  Closing,  the  Purchaser  shall  indemnify  and hold
            harmless the Seller from any

<PAGE>
                                       69


            obligation to compensate the Company for any loss (Sec. 302 AktG) in
            excess of the loss shown in the Company's financial statements as of
            any previous financial year end, or to return profits distributed in
            excess  of  the  amounts  which  would  have  been  permitted  to be
            distributed had the underlying  financial  statements of the Company
            been correct.  This  indemnity  shall be in force and effect only as
            long  as  the  Purchaser  or  Purchaser's  Guarantor  or  any of its
            Affiliates have control over the Company. Seller shall indemnify and
            hold  harmless the  Purchaser if under the Profit and Loss  Transfer
            Agreement  the Company is obligated to pay to Seller an amount which
            is higher than the amount shown in the Company financial  statements
            as of any previous financial year end.

14.3        Guarantees.  With  effect  as of the  Closing  Date and  subject  to
            Closing  occurring,   the  Purchaser  hereby  assumes  (i)  all  the
            obligations and liabilities  relating to any guarantees,  surety for
            payment,  performance  bonds,  comfort  letters  and other  security
            interests  of  any  kind   (including   those  for  old-age  partial
            retirement  (Altersteilzeit)  and customs) which the Seller's Group,
            or any Third  Party on behalf of any member of the  Seller's  Group,
            has provided or will provide  prior to the Closing  Date,  including
            those  which are  listed  in  Exhibit  14.3 (a),  in favor of, or on
            behalf of, any Group Company to banks, other financial institutions,
            suppliers,   customers  or  other  Third   Parties  (the   "Seller's
            Guarantees") and (ii) shall indemnify and hold harmless the relevant
            members of the Seller's Group from any  obligations  and liabilities
            arising under or in  connection  with the Seller's  Guarantees.  The
            Purchaser  shall  further,  prior to or on the Closing  Date, to the
            extent  that the  relevant  members  of the  Seller's  Group are not
            released  from any Seller's  Guarantees  other than those from which
            the Seller and its Affiliates  have been released in accordance with
            this  Section or such release is not  evidenced,  prior to or on the
            Closing  Date,  by documents  reasonably  acceptable  to the Seller,
            without the Seller having waived the fulfillment of such obligation,
            provide an unconditional  and irrevocable bank guarantee issued by a
            first class (A rated) European or US bank of international  standing
            and payable  upon first  demand,  in form and  substance  reasonably
            acceptable to the Seller (the  "Purchaser's  Bank  Guarantee"),  for
            each of the relevant  Seller's  Guarantees in an amount equal to the
            aggregate  (actual or  contingent)  liability of the Seller's  Group
            under such  Seller's  Guarantees as notified to the Purchaser by the
            Seller no later than five Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

14.4        Derivative Contracts. With effect as of the Closing Date and subject
            to  Closing  occurring  the  Purchaser  hereby  assumes,  and  shall
            indemnify and hold harmless the members of the Seller's  Group from,
            any and all obligations and liabilities  that exist or may arise for
            the  Seller's  Group  and that  relate  to the  derivative,  option,
            forward and hedge agreements and similar instruments which have been
            entered into in connection with the business operations of the Group
            Companies  until the Closing  Date  (including  the  creation of any
            security or  fulfillment  of any payment  obligations)  set forth in

            This  shall  include  (i) the  conclusion  of  transitional  service
            agreements  between the Group  Companies  and the Seller or Seller's
            Affiliates,  in each  case on  terms  mutually  agreed  between  the
            respective  parties  and (ii)  such  assistance  the  Purchaser  may
            reasonably  request to change the fiscal year of the  Company  after
            the Closing Date.

            in  Exhibit  17.2 that  have been  entered  into by  members  of the
            Seller's  Group will  terminate  upon Closing.  The  Purchaser  will
            procure  the  entry by the  Group  Companies  into IT  software  and
            service  agreements to replace such  terminating  agreements  and to
            secure a smooth transition.

17.3        Insurances.  The Purchaser  acknowledges  that the  insurance  cover
            provided  under the  insurance  policies  taken out by the  Seller's
            Group (including trade credit  insurance) and listed in Exhibit 17.3
            will  terminate  upon Closing.  The Purchaser  will procure that the
            Group Companies take out such insurance  coverage as is necessary as

            insurances prepaid and terminated early at the Closing Date less any
            termination fees to be borne by the Group  Companies.  If the Seller
            procures at its expense  insurance  coverage  for product  liability
            claims  arising under  Section 10.3 the Purchaser  shall ensure that
            the Group  Companies  fulfill their  obligations  under the relevant
            insurance,  if any, and the Seller and the  Purchaser  shall procure
            that the Group  Companies  cooperate in good faith to give effect to
            such insurance coverage.

17.4        Notification to Business  Partners.  The Purchaser will procure that
            the  Group  Companies  together  with the  Seller  will  notify  all
            business  partners in writing  promptly  after the Closing Date that
            any  payments,  credits  and  debits  may no  longer  be made on the
            accounts  belonging to the cash pool referred to in Section 4.2, but
            on such newly opened  accounts of the Group Companies only which are
            specified in the

            Date, the Seller or any of Seller's Affiliates receives any payments
            which are made for the benefit of the Company, then the Seller shall
            forward  (with no right to set off) such  amounts to a bank  account
            held by the Company as listed in Exhibit 17.4. If, after the Closing
            Date,  the  Seller  makes  payments  or incurs  liabilities  for the
            benefit of the Company which have been approved by the Purchaser and
            such  payments  or  liabilities  are  booked  on  an  account  to be
            established by Seller (the "Current  Account"),  the Purchaser shall
            procure  that such  amounts  are paid by the Company  without  undue
            delay. To the extent any debits are made by the Company and / or the
            Subsidiaries on the accounts  belonging to the cash pool referred to
            in Section 4.2  (including  the Current  Account)  after the Closing
            Date or any other accounts  maintained by the Seller's Group for the
            Company  and / or the  Subsidiaries  the  Purchaser  shall  promptly
            balance,  or shall procure that the Company will  promptly  balance,
            any such debit by making  payment  to the  respective  account.  Any
            payment to be made in  accordance  with this  Section  17.4 shall be
            made in the currency in which the respective account denominates.

17.5        Termination of Intra-group Agreements. The Seller shall procure that
            on or before the  Closing,  the  agreements  listed in Exhibit  17.5
            between the Group  Companies  on the one side and the Seller and the
            Seller's  Affiliates on the other side shall be terminated by mutual
            agreement with effect as of the Closing Date. The termination  shall
            be made without any additional costs due to such termination  (e.g.,
            break-up  fees) to the  respective  party;  outstanding  obligations
            shall be fulfilled when due.

            consultation  with the  Purchaser  the  Seller  shall (i) obtain the
            necessary  consent  declaration  of the competent tax authority with
            respect to the shortening of the Company's  fiscal year so that such
            short  fiscal year ends on or after the Closing  Date and (ii) shall
            undertake appropriate steps to give effect to such short fiscal year
            under  company  law.  The  Parties  shall use their best  efforts to
            timely  fix the  relevant  date  for the  short  fiscal  year and to
            implement the above steps. For the avoidance of doubts any resulting
            cost shall economically be borne by Purchaser.

            with respect to which  German  terms have been  inserted in brackets
            and / or italics  immediately after the English term, the respective

            Party  assumes  the  obligations  set forth or  referred  to in this

            connection with this Agreement including the breach,  termination or
            invalidity  thereof shall be finally settled by binding  arbitration
            by the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce

            chairman. If the two party-appointed arbitrators fail to appoint the
            third  arbitrator  within a period  of  thirty  (30)  days as of the
            appointment  of the  second  party-appointed  arbitrator  the  third
            arbitrator  shall  be  appointed  by  the  International  Center  of
            Arbitration  in  accordance  with  the ICC  Rules.  The  seat of the
            arbitration  shall be London.  The language of the arbitration shall
            be English,  provided that the parties to the  arbitration  shall be
            allowed  to  submit  documents  in German  or in  English.  For this
            Section  21.10 the Seller and Seller's  Guarantor  and the Purchaser
            and Purchaser's  Guarantor  respectively  shall be deemed to be each

21.11       Partial Invalidity.  In the case that one or more provisions of this

            other  provisions of this Agreement.  In such case the Parties agree
            to recognize and give effect to such valid and enforceable provision
            or provisions  which  reflect as closely as possible the  commercial
            intention  of such  invalid or  unenforceable  provision  as regards
            subject matter,  amount, time, place and extent. The aforesaid shall
            apply  mutatis  mutandis  to any gap in this  Agreement.  The Seller
            hereby  waives any  argument or claim or defense with respect to the
            validity and  enforceability  of Section 7.1.8  including the amount
            payable thereunder.

21.12       Full Liability. For the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall be 100%
            liable  (subject  to the  limitations  set  forth  herein)  for  the
            fulfillment of any of its covenants or other  obligations and any of
            Purchaser's rights or remedies under this Agreement,  without regard
            to the fact that the Seller owns, and shall transfer hereunder, less
            than 100% of the Shares in the Company.

21.13       Seller's  Guarantor.  Upon  accession of Seller's  Guarantor to this
            Agreement  in  accordance  with Section  7.2.3(iii)  which is hereby
            accepted by the Parties, Seller's Guarantor shall be a Party to this
            Agreement.
