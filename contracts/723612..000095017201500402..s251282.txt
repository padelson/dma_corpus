RECITALS   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company each have approved and declared advisable this
Agreement and the merger of Purchaser with and into the Company (the

delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition to Parent\'s willingness to
enter into this Agreement, Parent and United Air Lines, Inc., a Delaware

terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DGCL"), Purchaser shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate
corporate existence of Purchaser shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as

limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises of the Company and Purchaser shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, and duties of the Company and
Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.   1.2 The Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place
at the offices of Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue, 77 W. Wacker, Chicago,

following the satisfaction (or waiver, if permissible) of the conditions set
forth in Article VI. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the "Closing Date."   1.3 Effective Time. On or as soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause a
Certificate of Merger meeting the requirements of Section 251 of the DGCL
(the "Certificate of Merger") to be properly executed and filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time of filing of the Certificate of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance
with the DGCL or at such later time which the parties hereto shall have
agreed upon and designated in such filing as the effective time of the Merger
(the "Effective Time").   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws,
Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation; Directors of Parent.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent prior to the Closing, at
the Effective Time, without any further action on the part of Parent,

Company shall be amended and restated by virtue of the Merger to read in its
entirety in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (until further amended as
provided by law and by such Certificate of Incorporation) and, as so amended
and restated, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation;   (b) The Bylaws of Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be at and after the Effective Time (until amended
as provided by law, its Certificate of Incorporation and its Bylaws,
as applicable) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation;   (c) The officers
of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to
serve in their respective offices of the Surviving Corporation from and after
the Effective Time, until their successors are elected or appointed and
qualified or until their resignation or removal; and   (d) The directors of

the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time, until their
successors are elected or appointed and qualified or until their resignation
or removal.   1.5 Directors of Parent. At the Effective Time, Parent shall
take all actions necessary, including, amending its Bylaws, to cause its
Board of Directors to be expanded by one seat and to cause an
individual designated by the Board of Directors of the Company and
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and who is an Independent Director (as
hereinafter defined) to be nominated and appointed to the class of directors
whose term shall expire in 2004. A director shall be considered an
"Independent Director" if he or she has no relationship to Parent that may
interfere with the exercise of his or her independence from Parent and
its management. Individuals with the following relationships to Parent are
not independent: employment by Parent or any of its affiliates during
the then-current year or any of the past five years; acceptance of
compensation from Parent or any of its affiliates other than compensation for

the business organization in any of the past five years; and employment as
an executive of another company where any of Parent\'s executives serve on
that company\'s compensation committee.   ARTICLE II   Effect of the

Securities. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of Purchaser that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holders thereof, be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.   2.2 Company Securities.   (a)
Company Common Stock.   (i) At the Effective Time, each Participating
Company Share  shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part  of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive the 
following (the "Merger Consideration") (capitalized terms used in  this
Section 2.2(a) not otherwise defined in this Agreement have  the meanings
ascribed to such terms in Section 2.2(a)(iv)):   (A) the number of duly
authorized,  validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable  shares of Parent
Common Stock, rounded to the  nearest thousandth of a share, equal to the 
number (the "Exchange Ratio") determined by  dividing the Per Share Stock
Amount by the  Average Parent Trading Price, provided, however,  that (X) if
the foregoing would result in an  Exchange Ratio less than the Low-End Ratio,
then  the Exchange Ratio shall be the Low-End Ratio,  and (Y) if the
foregoing would result in an  Exchange Ratio greater than the High-End
Ratio,  then the Exchange Ratio shall be the High-End  Ratio (the "Per Share
Stock Consideration"),  provided, however, that the Per Share Stock 
Consideration is subject to increase as provided  in Section 2.2(a)(iii);  
(B) the lesser of (I) the Per Share  Cash Amount and (II) the number
determined by  dividing (X) the Actual Aggregate Cash  Consideration by (Y)
the excess of (a) the Total  Outstanding Company Shares over (b) the Total 
Parent Owned Company Shares (such lesser amount,  the "Per Share Cash
Consideration"), provided,  however, that the Per Share Cash Consideration 
is subject to decrease as provided in Section  2.2(a)(ii); and   (C) the
Per Share Additional Stock  Consideration, if any.   (ii) If cash is paid
in lieu of fractional shares or there  are shares of Dissenting Common Stock,
or both, then, (I) the  Actual Aggregate Cash Consideration shall be reduced
to equal the  Adjusted Actual Aggregate Cash Consideration and (II) the Per 
Share Cash Consideration that the holders of Participating  Company Shares
are entitled to receive pursuant to Section  2.2(a)(i)(B) shall be reduced to
equal the number determined by  dividing (X) the Adjusted Actual Aggregate
Cash Consideration by  (Y) the Participating Company Shares.   (iii) If
there are shares of Dissenting Common Stock, then  the Per Share Stock
Consideration that the holders of  Participating Company Shares are entitled
to receive pursuant to  Section 2.2(a)(i)(A) shall be increased to that
number of duly  authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
shares  of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest thousandth of a 
share, equal to the number determined by dividing (I) the Actual  Aggregate
Parent Shares by (II) the Participating Company Shares.   (iv) For purposes
of this Agreement:   "Actual Aggregate Cash Consideration" shall mean (I) if
the Preliminary Aggregate Cash Consideration is less than or equal to the
Cash Limitation Amount, then, an amount equal to the Preliminary Aggregate
Cash Consideration and (II) if the Preliminary Aggregate Cash
Consideration exceeds the Cash Limitation Amount, then, an amount equal to
the Cash Limitation Amount.   "Actual Aggregate Parent Shares" shall mean
the product of (I) the excess of (X) the Total Outstanding Company Shares
over (Y) the Total Parent Owned Company Shares, if any, and (II) the Per
Share Stock Consideration (determined prior to any increase pursuant to
Section 2.2(a)(iii)).   "Adjusted Actual Aggregate Cash Consideration"
shall mean the excess of (I) the Actual Aggregate Cash Consideration over
(II) the sum of (X) the Total Cash In Lieu and (Y) the Total Dissenting
Cash.   "Average Parent Trading Price" shall mean the arithmetic average of
the per share 4:00 p.m. Eastern time closing sales price of the Parent Common
Stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") (as reported on the NYSE
Composite Tape) during the Pricing Period.   "Cash Limitation Amount" shall
mean the number determined by dividing (I) the product of (X) the Cash
Limitation Percentage and (Y) the Total Closing Date Stock Consideration
Value by (II) the Control Requirement Percentage.   "Cash Limitation
Percentage" shall mean the excess (expressed as a decimal, without rounding)
of (I) one over (II) the Control Requirement Percentage. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Total Parent Owned Company Shares shall equal zero, the Cash
Limitation Percentage shall equal 0.1950.   "Closing Date Parent Stock
Price" shall mean the average of the high and low trading prices of the
Parent Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Tape on the date on which the
Effective Time occurs.   "Controlling Company Shares" shall mean the product
of (I) 0.8050 and (II) the Total Outstanding Company Shares.   "Control
Requirement Percentage" shall mean the fraction (expressed as a decimal,
without rounding), (I) the numerator of which shall equal the Controlling
Company Shares and (II) the denominator of which shall equal the excess of
(X) the Total Outstanding Company Shares over (Y) the Total Parent Owned
Company Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Total Parent Owned Company
Shares shall equal zero, the Control Requirement Percentage shall equal
0.8050.   "High-End Ratio" shall mean, subject to adjustment pursuant
to Section 2.4, the number determined by dividing (I) the Per Share
Stock Amount by (II) 17.   "Low-End Ratio" shall mean, subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.4, the number determined by dividing (I) the
Per Share Stock Amount by (II) 20.   "Participating Company Shares" shall
mean the excess of (I) the Total Outstanding Company Shares over (II) the sum
of (X) the number of shares of Dissenting Common Stock, if any, and (Y) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock, if any, cancelled pursuant to
Section 2.2(a)(vi).   "Per Share Additional Stock Consideration" shall mean
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded to the nearest
thousandth of a share, equal to the number determined by dividing (I) the Per
Share Additional Consideration Value by (II) the Closing Date Parent Stock
Price. For purposes of this Section 2.2(a), the Per Share Additional
Consideration Value shall be equal to simple interest on $33 calculated at
the 30 day London Interbank Offered Rate plus 100 basis points, from the date
that is 180 days from the date hereof to the date, if later, on which the
Effective Time occurs, provided, however, that if the event described in the
first sentence of Section 5.4(f) does not occur, the Per Share
Additional Consideration Value (and therefore, the Per Share Additional
Stock Consideration) shall be zero. Such amount, if any, shall be
determined using a year of 360 days to calculate the interest-equivalent
amount.  "Per Share Cash Amount" shall mean the product of (I) $33 and
(II) the Cash Limitation Percentage.   "Per Share Stock Amount" shall mean
the product of (I) $33 and (II) the Control Requirement Percentage.  
"Preliminary Aggregate Cash Consideration" shall mean the product of (I) the
Per Share Cash Amount and (II) the excess of (X) the Total Outstanding
Company Shares over (Y) the Total Parent Owned Company Shares.   "Pricing
Period" shall mean the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
third consecutive trading day prior to the date of the Stockholders Meeting;
provided, however, that if, primarily as a result of the execution by Parent
or any Subsidiary thereof of a Restricted Acquisition Agreement (as
hereinafter defined), the consents, approvals, permits or authorizations
described in Section 5.4 hereof are not obtained by the date that is 30 days
after the date on which the Stockholders Meeting occurs, the Pricing Period
shall be the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the third
consecutive trading day prior to the date on which the last of the approvals
described in Section 5.4 shall have been obtained and satisfied.   "Total
Cash In Lieu" shall mean the product of (I) the total number of registered
holders of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(II) the Closing Date Parent Stock Price.   "Total Dissenting Cash" shall
mean the product of (I) the number of shares of Dissenting Common Stock and
(II) the greater of (X) $33.00 and (Y) the sum of (a) the product of the Per
Share Stock Consideration (determined prior to any increase pursuant to
Section 2.2(a)(iii)) and the Closing Date Parent Stock Price and (b) the Per
Share Cash Consideration (determined prior to any decrease pursuant to
Section 2.2(a)(ii)).   "Total Parent Owned Company Shares" shall mean the
number of shares of Company Common Stock, if any, owned by Parent (or any
Subsidiary of Parent) at the Effective Time.   "Total Closing Date Stock
Consideration Value" shall mean the product of (I) the number of Actual
Aggregate Parent Shares and (II) the Closing Date Parent Stock Price.  
"Total Outstanding Company Shares" shall mean the total number of issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   (v) As a result of the Merger and without any action on the  part
of the holders thereof, at the Effective Time, all shares of  Company Common
Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be  cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder  of a share of Company Common Stock
(other than the Company or  holders of Total Parent Owned Company Shares)
shall thereafter  cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company  Common Stock, except the right to receive, without interest, the 
Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.3 upon the  surrender of a
certificate or certificates representing such  shares of Company Common
Stock.   (vi) Each share of Company Common Stock included in Total  Parent
Owned Company Shares or held in the Company\'s treasury at  the Effective
Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any  action on the part of
the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding  and shall be cancelled and
retired without payment of any  consideration therefor.   (b) Special
Voting Preferred Stock.   (i) At the Effective Time, without any action on
the part of  the holders thereof, any and all shares of Special Voting 
Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the  "Special

for an amount in cash equal to $100.00  per share (the "Preferred Redemption
Price"), payable by the  Company by certified check to each holder thereof at
its address  as set forth on the books of the Company at such time, shall 
cease to be outstanding or exist, and each holder of shares of  Special
Voting Preferred Stock shall thereafter cease to have any  rights with
respect to such shares of Special Voting Preferred  Stock, except the right
to receive, without interest, the  Preferred Redemption Price in accordance
with Section 2.3(b)(iv)  below upon the surrender of a certificate or
certificates  representing such shares of Special Voting Preferred Stock.
All  funds necessary to pay the Preferred Redemption Price and any  expenses
relating to the redemption of the Special Voting  Preferred Stock shall come
solely from the Company. All shares of  Special Voting Preferred Stock so
redeemed shall be retired and  shall not thereafter be reissued as part of
any series of  Preferred Stock of the Company.   (ii) Each share of Special
Voting Preferred Stock issued and  held in the Company\'s treasury at the
Effective Time shall, by  virtue of the Merger, cease to be outstanding and
shall be  cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration 
therefor.   (iii) Without limiting the generality or effect of Section 
1.4(d) and subject thereto, any and all directors elected to the  Company\'s
Board of Directors by holders of Special Voting  Preferred Stock shall, at
the Effective Time and the time of the  actions set forth in Section
2.2(b)(i) above, automatically and  without any further action by such
directors or such holders be  deemed to have resigned from the Company\'s
Board of Directors.   (iv) At the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to
be  mailed to each holder of Special Voting Preferred Stock a notice  of
redemption instructing such holder to surrender its  certificate(s)
representing Special Voting Preferred Stock in  exchange for the Preferred

deliver to such holder the  Preferred Redemption Price and the certificate(s)
representing  such shares shall forthwith be cancelled.   (c) Options and
SARs; Employee Stock Purchase Plan.   (i) Without limiting the generality or
effect of Section  2.2(a) or 2.3, but subject to subsection (v) of this
Section  2.2(c), the Company shall take all action necessary (which 
includes satisfying the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated  under
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as  amended (the "Exchange
Act")) to provide that, immediately prior  to the Effective Time, all options
to acquire shares of Company  Common Stock and all stock appreciation rights
related to the  price of Company Common Stock (individually, an "Option"
and  collectively, the "Options") outstanding immediately prior to the 
Effective Time under any Company stock option plan or other  equity incentive
plan (the "Company Stock Option Plans"), whether  or not then exercisable,
shall (A) cease to represent options to  acquire shares of, or stock
appreciation rights related to the  price of, Company Common Stock, (B) be
converted into options to  purchase shares of, or stock appreciation rights
related to the  price of, Parent Common Stock in an amount and at an
exercise  price determined as provided below and (C) with respect to 
unvested options or unvested stock appreciation rights that have  an exercise
price that is less than the Average Company Trading  Price (as hereinafter
defined), become fully vested and  exercisable (and otherwise be subject to
the terms of the  applicable option plans and the applicable option
agreements  representing grants thereunder) (the "Assumed Options"):   (1)
The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be  subject to each new option
or right shall be equal to the  product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock  subject to the original option or right and the Option 
Exchange Ratio (as hereinafter defined); provided that any  fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock resulting from such  multiplication shall be rounded
to the nearest whole share;  and   (2) The exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock  under each new option or right shall be equal to the 
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the  original option
or right divided by the Option Exchange  Ratio; provided that such exercise
price shall be rounded to  the nearest whole cent.   The adjustment
provided herein with respect to any options that  are intended to be
"incentive stock options" (as defined in  Section 422 of the Code) shall be
and is intended to be effected  in a manner that is consistent with Section
424(a) of the Code.  The duration and other terms of the new options and
rights shall,  except as provided above, be the same as the original options
and  rights except that all references to the Company shall be deemed  to be
references to Parent. For purposes of this Section 2.2(c),  (A) "Average
Company Trading Price" shall mean the arithmetic  average of the per share
4:00 p.m. Eastern time closing sales  price of the Company Common Stock on
the NYSE (as reported on the  New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape) for the
20 consecutive  trading days immediately preceding the third trading day
prior to  the date of the Stockholders Meeting and (B) "Option Exchange 
Ratio" shall mean the quotient derived by dividing $33.00 by the  Average
Parent Trading Price per share of Parent Common Stock;  provided that (X) if
the foregoing would result in an Option  Exchange Ratio less than 1.65000,
the Option Exchange Ratio shall  be deemed to be 1.65000 and (Y) if the
foregoing would result in  an Option Exchange Ratio greater than 1.94118, the
Option  Exchange Ratio shall be deemed to be 1.94118; provided further, 
however, that if the event described in the first sentence of  Section 5.4(e)
occurs, the Option Exchange Ratio shall be  appropriately and equitably
increased to take into account the  amount of the Per Share Additional Stock
Consideration.   (ii) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, 
Parent shall deliver, upon due surrender of the Assumed Options,  to holders
of Assumed Options appropriate agreements representing  the right to acquire
Parent Common Stock, or stock appreciation  rights related to the price of
Parent Common Stock, on the same  terms and conditions as contained in the
Assumed Options (except  as otherwise set forth in this Section 2.2(c)).
Except as  expressly contemplated herein, Parent shall comply with the
terms  of the Company Stock Option Plans as they apply to the Assumed 
Options. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to  reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent  Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of the Assumed Options in  accordance with this Section 2.2(c).
Parent shall file with the  SEC (as hereinafter defined) a registration
statement on Form S-8  (or any successor form) under the Securities Act of
1933, as  amended (the "Securities Act") or on another appropriate form, 
effective as of, or reasonably promptly following, the Effective  Time, with
respect to Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed  Options and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain  the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration  statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or  prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
the Assumed  Options remain outstanding and exercisable. With respect to
those  individuals, if any, who, subsequent to the Effective Time, will  be
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16 of the  Exchange Act,
Parent shall administer the Company Stock Option  Plans, where applicable, in
a manner that complies with Rule  16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act.   (iii) Effective at or before the Effective Time, the Company  shall
take all actions necessary to cause the termination of the  Galileo
International, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  "Company ESPP") and
shall take all necessary steps to refund,  without interest, to each
Participant (as defined in the Company  ESPP) any amounts withheld from such
Participant\'s compensation  pursuant to a subscription agreement under the
Company ESPP to  the extent that such amount has not been used to purchase
Company  Common Stock on a Purchase Date (as defined in the Company ESPP) 
occurring prior to the effective date of termination of the  Company
ESPP.   (iv) After the Effective Time, all options to acquire shares  of
common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Quantitude Common  Stock"), of
Quantitude, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly  owned subsidiary of
the Company ("Quantitude"), and shares of  common stock, par value $.01 per
share ("Trip Common Stock"), of  Trip.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
wholly owned  subsidiary of the Company ("Trip"), outstanding immediately
prior  to the Effective Time under the Quantitude Inc. 2001 Equity 
Incentive Plan in the form heretofore provided to Parent (the  "Quantitude
Stock Option Plan") and the Trip.com, Inc. 2001  Equity Incentive Plan in the
form heretofore provided to Parent  (the "Trip Stock Option Plan," and
together with the Quantitude  Stock Option Plan the "Subsidiary Plans"),
whether or not  exercisable, shall remain outstanding following the
Effective  Time and remain subject to the terms of the applicable
Subsidiary  Plan and the applicable option agreements representing grants 
thereunder.   (v) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall use its 
reasonable best efforts (which include satisfying the  requirements of Rule
16b-3(e) promulgated under Section 16 of the  Exchange Act) to provide that,
immediately prior to the Effective  Time, all stock appreciation rights
related to Company Stock  (individually, an "SAR" and collectively, the
"SARs") outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time under any
equity  incentive plan of the Company ("Company Equity Incentive Plan"), 
whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled and each  holder of SAR
shall promptly after the Effective Time receive  from the Surviving
Corporation, for each SAR, (I) an amount in  cash equal to the difference of
the Merger Consideration minus  the per share exercise price of such SAR,
without interest, to  the extent such difference is a positive number or (II)
to the  extent such difference is a negative number, such other 
consideration as is described in subsection (B) below  (hereinafter referred
to as the "SAR Consideration"), and that  all SARs will be terminated and
thereafter represent only the  right to receive the SAR Consideration;
provided, however that  with respect to any Person subject to Section 16(a)
of the  Exchange Act, any such amount will be paid as soon as practicable 
after the first date payment can be made without liability to  such Person
under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.   (A) Notwithstanding anything
herein stated, no SAR  Consideration will be paid with respect to any SAR
unless,  at or prior to the time of such payment (i) such SAR is  cancelled
and (ii) to the extent necessary under the terms  of such SAR, the holder of
such SAR has executed and  delivered a release of any and all rights the
holder had or  may have had in respect of such.   (B) Without limiting the
generality or effect of the  foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will use  reasonable best efforts to obtain all necessary consents
or  releases, if any, from holders of SARs under any Company  Equity
Incentive Plan and take all such other lawful action  as may be necessary to
give effect to the transactions  contemplated by this Section. In the event
that any SAR is  not cancelled in accordance with the foregoing, such SAR 
shall be converted to a stock appreciation right related to  the price of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section  2.2(c)(i). The Company or its
Subsidiaries may, but shall  not be required to, offer additional
consideration for the  purpose of obtaining such consents or releases. Such 
additional consideration shall be subject to the advance  approval of Parent,
which approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld.   2.3 Exchange of
Certificates Representing Company Common Stock.   (a) As of the Effective
Time, (i) Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company, reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent")
hereunder for payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
certificates representing any shares of Company Common Stock cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.2(a) (the "Certificates") and (ii) Parent shall enter
into an agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably satisfactory to the
Company which shall provide that Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent
as of the Effective Time, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the
Exchange Agent, certificates representing the aggregate number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole share)
issuable pursuant to Section 2.2 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock and an amount of cash equal to the aggregate amount
payable to the holders of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (such
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto with a record date after the Effective
Time being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Exchange Fund").  
(b) As promptly as possible after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Company Common
Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 (i) a letter of transmittal which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and which letter shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as are customary for letters of this nature, and (ii) instructions
for effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Exchange Agent, (i) the holder of such Certificate
representing Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor certificates representing that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, certain dividends or other distributions in
accordance with Section 2.3(c) and a check in the amount equal to the cash
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II (including any cash in lieu of any fractional shares in accordance
with Section 2.3(e)), and (ii) the shares represented by the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or will
accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, exchange and payment may be made with
respect to such Company Common Stock to such a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence
and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.3, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time for all purposes, to represent the right to receive upon surrender
the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares formerly
represented thereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Certificates representing
Company Common Stock surrendered for exchange by any person constituting
an "affiliate" of the Company shall not be exchanged until Parent has
received an Affiliate Letter as provided in Exhibit B hereto. From and after
the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   (c) No
dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock with a
record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificate with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (including any cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.3(e)) shall be paid to any
such holder, and all such dividends, other distributions and cash shall be
paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and shall be included in the Exchange
Fund, in each case until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this Article II. Subject to the effect of applicable escheat or similar laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate there shall be paid to the holder
of the certificate representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and the amount of cash which such holder has the right to
receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (including any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3(e)) and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time and with a payment date subsequent to
such surrender payable with respect to each whole share of Parent Common
Stock.   (d) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article II (including any cash paid pursuant to this Article II) shall be
deemed to have been issued (and paid) at the Effective Time in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock,
theretofore represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the
Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to pay any dividends or make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may
have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, which remain unpaid at
the Effective Time.   (e) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger upon the surrender for
exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution of Parent shall relate
to such fractional share interests and such fractional share interests will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder
of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of such fractional shares, the
Exchange Agent shall sell such number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole share) in the open market in order to
pay each former holder of Company Common Stock an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to
which such former holder (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise
be entitled by (B) the Average Parent Trading Price.   (ii) As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid
to holders of Certificates formerly representing Company Common Stock with
respect to any fractional share interests, the Exchange Agent shall make
available such amounts to such holders of Certificates formerly representing
Company Common Stock subject to and in accordance with the terms of Section
2.3(b).   (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds
of any interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in respect
of all such funds) that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of
the Company six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent. Any former stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation as general creditors for payment of any Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, that may be payable in respect
of each share of Company Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement.   (g) None of Parent, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable
to any former holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.   (h) In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of
a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim which may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in each case, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   2.4
Adjustment of Merger Consideration.   (a) If, subsequent to the date of this
Agreement but prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number of
shares or a different class as a result of a stock split, reverse stock
split, stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange,
recapitalization or other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio and the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately and equitably adjusted.   (b)
If, subsequent to the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time,
Parent declares, sets aside or pays any dividend or makes any other
distribution or payment (whether in cash, stock, property or any combination
thereof), in each such case with respect to its outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock, including, without limitation, any of the foregoing in
connection with a spin-off, split-off or split-up, the record date for which
is prior to the Effective Time (a "Section 2.4(b) Transaction"), then the
following adjustments shall be made to the Low-End Ratio, the High-End Ratio
and the Walk-Away Price (as hereinafter defined):   (i) the High-End Ratio
shall equal the number determined by  dividing the Per Share Stock Amount by
the Adjusted High-End  Price;   (ii) the Low-End Ratio shall equal the
number determined by  dividing the Per Share Stock Amount by the Adjusted
Low-End  Price; and   (iii) the Walk-Away Price shall equal $14.00 minus
the  Adjustment Factor.   (c) As used in this Section 2.4, the following
terms shall have the following meanings:   (i) "Adjusted High-End Price"
shall mean an amount equal to  $17.00 minus the Adjustment Factor;   (ii)
"Adjusted Low-End Price" shall mean an amount equal to  $20.00 minus the
Adjustment Factor; and   (iii) "Adjustment Factor" shall mean the number
determined  by dividing the Distribution Value by the aggregate number of 
shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective
Time.   (iv) "Distribution Value" shall mean (I) for Section 2.4(b) 
Transactions not involving a Spin-Off (as hereinafter defined)  the aggregate
fair market value on the distribution date of the  assets, property, cash,
securities, rights, warrants or options  distributed in respect of the Parent
Common Stock in the Section  2.4(b) Transaction, as determined in good faith
by the Board of  Directors of Parent; or (II) in respect of a dividend or
other  distribution of shares of capital stock of any class or series,  or
similar equity interests, of or relating to a Subsidiary or  other business
unit of Parent, which securities are listed for  and are actually trading on
an exchange or the Nasdaq National  Market System (a "Spin-Off"), the product
of (x) the arithmetic  average of the per share 4:00 p.m. Eastern time
closing sales  price of such securities for the 10 consecutive trading days 
commencing on and including the first day of trading of such  securities
after the effectiveness of the Spin-Off, and (y) the  aggregate number of
such securities outstanding during such  10-day period.   (d) Parent shall
not, during the Pricing Period, effect any Section 2.4(b) Transaction or
cause the Parent Common Stock to trade ex-dividend with respect to any
Section 2.4(b) Transaction.   (e) Parent shall not, prior to the Effective
Time, effect, or cause the Parent Common Stock to trade ex-dividend with
respect to, any Section 2.4(b) Transaction other than the previously
announced Spin-Off of Parent\'s individual membership and loyalty
business.   2.5 Dissenting Company Stockholders. Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common
Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and which are held by holders of such shares of Company Common Stock
who properly exercise appraisal rights with respect thereto in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Common Stock") shall not
be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and
holders of such shares of Dissenting Common Stock will be entitled only to
receive payment of the appraised value of such shares of Company Common Stock
in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until
such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights
to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time,
any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such
right, such shares of Company Common Stock will thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of
any demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of Company
Common Stock and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company
shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any
such demands.   ARTICLE III   Representations and Warranties of the
Company   The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Purchaser as follows:   3.1 Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority.
The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. The Company is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing under the laws of any other state of the United States in which
the ownership of its properties or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
assets, liabilities, business, results of operations, or financial condition
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except any such
effect resulting primarily from (a) this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the announcement thereof, (b) Parent\'s
announcement or other communication of Parent of the plans or intentions of
Parent with respect to the conduct of the business (or any portion thereof)
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) changes or conditions
(including changes in economic, financial market, regulatory or political
conditions) affecting generally the air travel industry, the CRS industry, or
the information services industry in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries participates or (d) the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' failure
to engage in actions and activities in accordance with Section 5.2(b) in
furtherance of the Company\'s web hosting business or Quantitude\'s third
party telecommunications business (a "Company Material Adverse Effect") and
would not prevent or materially delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease and operate its properties and to carry
on its business as now conducted, except where the failure to have such power
and authority has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect and would not prevent or materially
delay consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as set
forth in Schedule 3.1 of the disclosure letter, dated this date, delivered by
the Company to Parent (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), the Company
has heretofore delivered to Parent true and correct copies of the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (or equivalent organizational
documents) as currently in effect for the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, such Certificates of Incorporation and Bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents) are in full force and effect and no other
organizational documents are applicable to or binding upon the Company or
its Subsidiaries. The term "Subsidiaries," when used in this Agreement
with respect to any party, means any corporation or other organization,
whether incorporated or unincorporated, of which such party directly or
indirectly owns or controls more than 50% of the securities or other
interests having by their terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the board of directors or other governing body performing similar
functions.   3.2 Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements.
The Company\'s Board of Directors has on or prior to the date of this
Agreement (a) declared the Merger advisable and in the best interest of the
Company and its stockholders and approved this Agreement in accordance
with applicable Law, (b) resolved to recommend the approval of this Agreement
by the Company\'s stockholders at a meeting thereof duly called and held
in accordance with the Company\'s Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
and the requirements of the DGCL (the "Stockholders Meeting") and (c)
directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Company\'s stockholders for
approval (collectively, the "Board Recommendation"). The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, the Option Agreement and all other agreements and documents
contemplated hereby (the "Ancillary Documents") to which it is a party and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Option Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents to which it is a party by the Company and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
and validly authorized by the Company\'s Board of Directors, and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement, the Option Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which it
is a party or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby other than (i) assuming the accuracy of Parent\'s and
Purchaser\'s representation and warranty set forth in Section 4.16, the
approval of this Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (voting as one
class with each share of Company Common Stock having one vote) (the "Company
Stockholder Approval") and (ii) the filing and recordation of the Certificate
of Merger in accordance with the DGCL. This Agreement and the Option
Agreement have been, and any Ancillary Document to which the Company is a
party at the time of execution shall have been, duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Company, and (assuming this Agreement and such Ancillary
Documents each constitutes a valid and binding obligation of any other
parties thereto) constitutes and will constitute the valid and binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective
terms, subject, as to enforceability, to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
relating to creditors\' rights and general principles of equity.   3.3
Compliance with Laws. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.3 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance
with and are not in default under or in violation of (a) their respective
Certificates of Incorporation and Bylaws (or equivalent organizational
documents), (b) any order of any foreign, federal, state or local judicial,
legislative, executive, administrative or regulatory body or authority or any
arbitration board or tribunal ("Governmental Entity") or (c) any foreign,
federal, state or local law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree ("Laws") applicable to the Company or such Subsidiaries or

Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.10 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there is no agreement, contract, plan or arrangement involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and covering any person that individually
or collectively could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not

respective Subsidiaries by reason of Section 280G of the Code. For purposes
of this Agreement, (A) "Tax" (and, with correlative meaning, "Taxes") means
any (x) federal, state, local or foreign income, gross receipts, property,
sales, use, license, excise, franchise, employment, payroll, premium,

3.11 Employee Benefit Plans. (a) All employee benefit plans, compensation
arrangements and other benefit arrangements, whether or not "employee benefit
plans" (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA (as hereinafter defined),
whether or not subject to ERISA), providing cash-or equity-based incentives,
health, medical, dental, disability, accident or life insurance benefits or
severance, retirement, pension or savings benefits, which are subject to U.S.
Law and cover employees, directors, former employees and former directors of
the Company or its Subsidiaries (the "Company Benefit Plans") and all
employee agreements (excluding (i) offer letters establishing the terms of
at-will employment and (ii) non-U.S. employment or consulting agreements,
which in each case are required or imposed by the Law of the jurisdiction)
providing compensation, severance or other benefits to any officer, employee
or former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries are set forth in
Schedule 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, any Company Benefit Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code has
received a determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service and, to
the knowledge of the Company, continues to satisfy the requirements for
such qualification, except for where the failure to so qualify, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.11
of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate of the Company maintains, contributes to, or has since January 1,
1996, maintained or contributed to, any benefit plan which is covered by
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Except as set forth in Schedule
3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, no Company Benefit Plan and neither
the Company nor its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability or penalty
under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA which, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Material Adverse Effect or has engaged in any transaction
which is reasonably likely to result in any such liability or penalty. Except
as set forth in Schedule 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, each
Company Benefit Plan has been maintained and administered in compliance with
its terms and with ERISA and the Code to the extent applicable thereto,
except for such non-compliance which, individually or in the aggregate, has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.8 or Schedule 3.11 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, there is no pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened Litigation against or otherwise involving any of the
Company Benefit Plans and no Litigation (excluding routine claims for
benefits incurred in the ordinary course of Company Benefit Plan activities)
has been brought against or with respect to any such Company Benefit
Plan, except for any of the foregoing which, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except as required by Law or as set forth in
Schedule 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to any plan or arrangement which, and
no Company Benefit Plan, provides, or has any liability to provide, life
insurance or medical or other employee welfare benefits to any employee or
former employee upon his retirement or termination of employment. Except as
set forth in Schedule 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, all
contributions required to be made with respect to any Company Benefit Plan on
or prior to the Closing Date have been timely made or are reflected on the
balance sheet of the Company dated March 31, 2001, except for such failures
to contribute as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except
as would not be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect, and except as set forth in Schedule 3.11 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, there has been no formal amendment by the Company to any Company
Benefit Plan that would increase materially the expense of maintaining such
Plan above the level or expense incurred in respect thereof for the year
ended December 31, 2000. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.11 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will not, either alone or in combination with another
event, (A) entitle any current or former employee or officer of the Company
or any ERISA Affiliate to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any
other payment, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, or (B)
accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee or officer except as expressly provided in
this Agreement, and no amounts payable under the Company Benefit Plans will
fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue of Section
280G of the Code. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.11 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, no liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA Affiliates since
the effective date of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full and
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, with respect to each Company
Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the present value of
projected benefit obligations under such Company Benefit Plan, as determined
by the Company Benefit Plan\'s actuary based upon the actuarial assumptions
used for funding purposes in the most recent actuarial report prepared by
the Company Benefit Plan\'s actuary with respect to such Company Benefit
Plan, did not, as of its latest valuation date, exceed the then current value
of the assets of such Company Benefit Plan allocable to such projected
benefit obligations. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.11 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, no Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan," as such
term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or a "multiple employer plan" as
such term is defined in Section 413 of the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan
that is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code satisfies the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, except
where non-compliance would not be reasonably expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.11 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, with respect to each Company Benefit Plan that is not
subject to United States Law (a "Foreign Benefit Plan"): (i) all employer and
employee contributions to each Foreign Benefit Plan required by Law or by the
terms of such Foreign Benefit Plan have been made, or if applicable, accrued
in accordance with normal accounting practices except for such
contributions or accruals, the failure of which to make or accrue,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (ii) the fair market
value of the assets of each funded Foreign Benefit Plan, the liability of
each insurer for any Foreign Benefit Plan funded through insurance or the
book reserve established for any Foreign Benefit Plan, together with any
accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued
benefit obligations, as of the Closing Date, with respect to all current and
former participants in such plan according to the actuarial assumptions
and valuations most recently used to determine employer contributions to
such Foreign Benefit Plan and no transaction contemplated by this
Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations to be less than
such benefit obligations, except in each case, for insufficiencies
or transactions which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;
and (iii) each Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered has
been registered and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable regulatory authorities except for such failures to register or
maintain as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) For
purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" means any business or entity
which is a member of the same "controlled group of corporations," under
"common control" or an "affiliated service group" with an entity within the
meanings of Sections 414(b), (c) or (m) of the Code, or required to be
aggregated with the entity under Section 414(o) of the Code, or is under
"common control" with the entity, within the meaning of Section 400l(a)(14)
of ERISA, or any regulations promulgated or proposed under any of the
foregoing Sections.   3.12 Labor and Employment Matters. Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter or to the extent imposed
or implied by applicable foreign Law, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by, any collective
bargaining agreement with employees or other Contracts or understandings with
a labor union or labor organization. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12 of
the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no strikes or lockouts with respect
to any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary, and to the knowledge of
the Company, there is no union organizing effort pending or threatened
against the Company or any Subsidiary. Except for such matters which,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or except as set forth in
Schedule 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, (a) there is no unfair
labor practice, labor dispute (other than routine individual grievances) or
labor arbitration proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to
their business; (b) there is no slowdown, work stoppage or threat thereof by
or with respect to such employees; and (c) the Company and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Laws respecting (A)
employment and employment practices, (B) terms and conditions of employment
and wages and hours, and (C) unfair labor practices. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.8 or Schedule 3.12 of the Company Disclosure Letter, there is no
Litigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, at law or in equity, alleging
a violation of applicable Laws, rules or regulations respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment and
wages and hours, or unfair labor practice that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably by expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (the
"WARN Act") as a result of any action taken by the Company (other than at
the written direction of Parent) and that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.   3.13 Intellectual Property Rights.    (a) Schedule
3.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter set forth a complete and accurate list
of all U.S. and foreign patents, patent applications, trademarks, trademark
applications, trademark registrations, Internet domain name registrations,
service marks, service mark applications, service mark registrations, logos,
copyrights, copyright registrations and copyright applications, and such

all the Intellectual Property Rights that are material to the conduct of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
("Material Intellectual Property Rights") used by it in connection with its
businesses as currently conducted or planned to be conducted, in each case,
free and clear of all Liens, except for where the failure to own, be
validly licensed or have the right to use such Material Intellectual
Property Rights or where the presence of Liens on such Material
Intellectual Property Rights would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.13
of the Company Disclosure Letter, no claims are pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened in writing that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating or
interfering with the rights of any person with regard to any Intellectual
Property Rights. Except as set forth in Schedule 3.13 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, as of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of the

or any of its Subsidiaries have been duly registered, filed with or issued by
each appropriate Governmental Entity in the jurisdiction indicated on

rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by
Parent or Purchaser with respect to statements made or incorporated by
reference therein based on information supplied by the Company specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Form S-4.   4.11 Tax
Matters. None of Parent nor any of its affiliates has taken or agreed to take
any action, has failed to take any action, or knows of any fact, agreement,
plan or other circumstance that is reasonably likely to prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.   4.12 State Takeover Statutes. Prior to the date hereof,
Parent\'s Board of Directors has approved the Merger, this Agreement, the
Option Agreement, the Transaction Support Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. To the knowledge of Parent, no
state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation applies to
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Documents and no
such statute or regulation and no similar provision of the Certificate
of Incorporation or Bylaws of Parent would, directly or indirectly,
restrict or impair the ability of Parent to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.   4.13 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except (a) as
reflected or reserved against in Parent\'s consolidated balance sheets (or
the notes thereto) included in the Parent 2000 Annual Report or in Parent\'s
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2001,
(b) for liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and (c) for liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice since March 31,
2001, neither Parent nor any Subsidiary of Parent has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance
sheet of Parent and its Subsidiaries (or in the notes thereto).   4.14
Parent Shareholder Approval. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Article II hereof, do not require the approval of the holders of any shares
of capital stock of Parent.   4.15 Parent Common Stock. All shares of Parent
Common Stock which may be issued pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to
the Assumed Options shall be, when issued in accordance with this Agreement,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Parent Common Stock, and shall not be subject to preemptive rights.   4.16
Ownership of Company Common Stock. To Parent\'s knowledge, neither Parent,
Purchaser nor any of their respective affiliates, (i) beneficially owns (as
defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, or
(ii) is an owner or owns (as defined in Section 203(c)(9) of the DGCL), in
each case, shares of capital stock of the Company, except, in each such case,
as may result from the execution or performance of the Option Agreement and
the Transaction Support Agreement.   ARTICLE V   Covenants   5.1
Alternative Proposals.   (a) Except as set forth below, from and after the
date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees that neither
it nor any Subsidiary or affiliate of it, nor any officer, director,
employee, investment banker, agent or other representative of it or its
Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, invite, initiate
or solicit any inquiries relating to or the submission or making of a
proposal by any person with respect to a Third-Party Acquisition (as defined
below) or (ii) participate in or encourage, invite, initiate or solicit
negotiations or discussions with, or furnish or cause to be furnished any
information to, any person relating to a Third-Party Acquisition. Upon the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall immediately (A) cease, or
cause to be ceased, any discussions or negotiations with any person, entity
or group in connection with any proposed or potential Third-Party Acquisition
and shall request the prompt return to the Company, or destruction of,
any confidential information provided in connection with any such
discussions or negotiations and (B) take all actions necessary to terminate,
effective as of the business day immediately following the date hereof, the
Company\'s stock repurchase program authorized by the Company\'s Board of
Directors on April 21, 2000 (the "Stock Repurchase Program"). Except as
otherwise provided in Sections 5.1(d) and 5.3, the Company\'s Board of
Directors shall not (1) make a Change in the Company Recommendation (as
defined in Section 5.3(b)), or (2) cause the Company to enter into any
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, letter of intent,
contract or agreement (whether written or oral) (each, a "Company
Acquisition Agreement") related to any Third-Party Acquisition.   (b) Prior
to the Stockholders Meeting, if the Company, without being in violation of
the terms of this Section 5.1, receives an unsolicited bona fide written
proposal from any person or group with respect to a Third-Party Acquisition
which the Company\'s Board of Directors (after consideration of advice it
shall have obtained from its legal and financial advisors) reasonably expects
will result in a Superior Proposal (as hereinafter defined), then the Company
may, directly or indirectly, furnish information and access to such person or
group pursuant to an appropriate confidentiality agreement and may
participate in discussions and negotiations with such person or group;
provided, however, that the terms of such confidentiality agreement shall not
be less restrictive than the terms set forth in the confidentiality agreement
between the Company and Parent, dated as of March 9, 2001 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").   (c) The Company shall notify Parent in
writing of the receipt of any proposal, written or oral, as soon as possible,
but, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of the receipt of any such
proposal, relating to a Third-Party Acquisition or any request for non-public
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with any pending, proposed or contemplated Third-Party Acquisition or for
access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any Subsidiary
by any person that, to the knowledge of the Company, is considering making,
or has made, a proposal relating to a Third-Party Acquisition. Such notice
shall identify the person submitting the proposal, attach a copy of any
written correspondence or other written materials relating to such proposal,
and summarize any significant terms of such proposal not reflected in any
such attached materials, and, to the extent then known by the Company,
state whether the Company is providing or intends to provide the person or
group making such proposal with access to information concerning the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, in accordance with this Section 5.1, including
any expectation by the Company\'s Board of Directors, if then known, that
such Third-Party Acquisition proposal will result in a Superior Proposal or,
if not then known, then the Company shall thereafter give prompt notice
to Parent of any subsequent determination as to the provision to the person
or group making such proposal of access to such information, and any
such expectation. The Company shall keep Parent informed of the status of
any such negotiations and shall further update, to the extent of
any significant developments, the information required to be provided in
each notice upon the request of Parent.   (d) Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the Company or its Board of Directors
shall be permitted, to the extent applicable, to comply with Rule 14e-2(a) of
the Exchange Act or to make any required disclosure to the stockholders of
the Company if, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the
Company (after consideration of advice it shall have obtained from its
outside counsel) failure to so disclose would constitute a violation of
applicable law and (ii) in the event that the Company\'s Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consideration of advice it shall have
obtained from its outside counsel, that failure to take such action would
create a substantial probability of violating the Company\'s Board of
Directors\' fiduciary duties to the Company\'s stockholders under applicable
Law, the Company\'s Board of Directors may make a Change in the
Company Recommendation and disclose to the Company\'s stockholders the
position of the Company\'s Board of Directors with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise make disclosure to them, with
respect to the matters to be considered at the Stockholders Meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligation of the Company to duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold the Stockholders Meeting in accordance with
Section 5.3 hereof shall not be affected by the commencement, proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the Company of a Third-Party
Acquisition or a Superior Proposal or by the taking of any action by the
Company\'s Board of Directors in accordance with this Section 5.1.   (e) As
used in this Agreement, the term "Third-Party Acquisition" shall mean any of
the following events other than, in each case, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement: (i) the merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company, or any purchase or
sale of the consolidated assets (including without limitation stock of
Subsidiaries) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole having an
aggregate value of 20% or more of the total assets of the Company, or any
purchase or sale of, or tender or exchange offer for 20% or more of the
equity securities of the Company, or a "merger of equals" with, any person
which includes any officer or director of the Company or any of its
affiliates or any affiliate of such officer or director) other than a
Subsidiary of Parent (a "Third Party"); (ii) the acquisition by a Third Party
of twenty percent (20%) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock; (iii) the acquisition by a Third Party of Quantitude or Trip; (iv) the
adoption by the Company of a plan of liquidation or the declaration or
payment of an extraordinary dividend; or (v) the repurchase by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries of more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock.   (f) As used in this Agreement, "Superior
Proposal" means any bona fide written proposal to acquire, directly or
indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash and/or securities, all of
the shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding or all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company, that (i) is not subject to any financing
conditions or contingencies, (ii) provides holders of Company Common Stock
with per share consideration that the Company\'s Board of Directors
determines in good faith (after consideration of advice that it shall have
obtained from its financial advisor) to be more favorable to the stockholders
of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger Consideration
(taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes to the financial or other terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise), (iii)
is determined by the Company\'s Board of Directors in its good faith
judgment (after consideration of advice that it shall have obtained from its
legal or financial advisor) to be reasonably capable of being completed
(taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of
the proposal, the person making the proposal and the expected timing
to complete the proposal) and (iv) does not, in the definitive
Company Acquisition Agreement, contain any "due diligence" conditions.

Effective Time, except as set forth in Schedule 5.2 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, or unless Parent has consented in writing thereto, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, (i) conduct its operations only in, and not take any actions
except in, the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice;
(ii) use its reasonable best efforts to preserve intact its business
organizations and goodwill, keep available the services of its officers and
employees, and maintain satisfactory relationships with those persons having
business relationships with them; and (iii) upon the discovery thereof,
promptly notify Parent of the existence of any breach of any representation
or warranty contained herein (or, in the case of any representation
or warranty that makes no reference to Company Material Adverse Effect
other than the representations and warranties in Section 3.4 or Section
3.7(b), any breach of such representation or warranty that would reasonably
be expected to result in costs to the Company in excess of $3,000,000
("Excess Costs")) or the occurrence of any event that would cause any
representation or warranty contained herein no longer to be true and correct
(or, in the case of any representation or warranty that makes no reference to
Company Material Adverse Effect other than the representations and warranties
in Section 3.4 or Section 3.7(b), where the effect of no longer being true
and correct would reasonably be expected to result in Excess Costs).   (b)
Without limiting the generality of Section 5.2(a), from and after the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, except for actions required to be
taken by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the performance of their
respective obligations under the Contracts listed in Schedule 3.16 of the
Company Disclosure Letter, or as set forth in Schedule 5.2 of the Company

Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall, with the
assistance and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and
Parent shall, with the assistance and approval of the Company (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), prepare and file with the SEC
the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus
(the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). Each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. The Company will
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to
its stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act and, subject to Section 5.1, solicit from
holders of shares of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and take all other action reasonably necessary or advisable to
secure, at the Stockholders Meeting, the Company Stockholder Approval. Parent
also shall take any action (other than qualifying to do business in
any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be
taken under any applicable state securities law in connection with the
issuance of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and the
Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders
of the Company Common Stock and rights to acquire Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Company Stock Option Plans as may be reasonably required in
connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement will be made by Parent or the
Company, respectively, without providing the other party the opportunity to
review and comment thereon; provided, that with respect to documents filed by
a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply only with
respect to information relating to the other party or its business,
financial condition or results of operations; and provided, further, that
the Company, in connection with a Change in the Company Recommendation,
may amend or supplement the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including
by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment (as
defined below) to effect a Change in the Company Recommendation, and in such
event, this right of review and comment shall be satisfied if the Company
files the Qualifying Amendment no earlier than 24 hours after providing
Parent with notice and a copy thereof. A "Qualifying Amendment" means an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4
(including by incorporation by reference) to the extent it contains (i) a
Change in the Company Recommendation, (ii) a statement of the reasons of the
Company\'s Board of Directors for making such Change in the Company
Recommendation and (iii) additional information reasonably related to the
foregoing. Parent will advise the Company, promptly after it receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or any supplement
or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the
SEC for amendment of the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC for additional information. The Company will
inform Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by
the SEC for the amendment of the Proxy Statement and responses thereto
or requests by the SEC for additional information. Each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company shall furnish all information concerning itself to
the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action
and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement. The
Company, Parent and Purchaser each agree to correct any information provided
by it for use in the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement which shall have
become false or misleading. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time,
any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent
or Company which should be but is not set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that any of
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.  
(b) The Company, acting through the Company\'s Board of Directors, shall in
accordance with applicable Law (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and
hold, as promptly as practicable following the date upon which the Form S-4
becomes effective, the Stockholders Meeting and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit from holders of shares of Company Common Stock proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and take all other action necessary
or advisable to secure, at the Stockholders Meeting, the Company Stockholder
Approval, by the vote described in Section 3.2 of this Agreement, and the
Company\'s Board of Directors shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by
the stockholders of the Company to the effect set forth in Section 3.2 of
this Agreement (the "Company Recommendation"), and shall not, in response to
any proposal for a Third-Party Acquisition, a Superior Proposal or otherwise
(1) withdraw, revoke or change the Company Recommendation, or (2) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Third-Party
Acquisition (collectively, a "Change in the Company Recommendation");
provided, the foregoing shall not prohibit accurate disclosure (and such
disclosure shall not be deemed to be a Change in the Company Recommendation)
of factual information regarding the business, financial condition or results
of operations of Parent or the Company or the fact that a proposal for a
Third-Party Acquisition has been made, the identity of the party making such
proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or otherwise, to the extent such information, facts,
identity or terms is required to be disclosed under applicable Law; provided
that the Company affirmatively states that it recommends that its
stockholders vote in favor of the Merger and, provided further, that, without
limitation of the foregoing, the Company\'s Board of Directors may make a
Change in the Company Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof.   (c)
If there is a Change in the Company Recommendation in accordance with Section
5.1 hereof and this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to Article VII
hereof, then, without limiting the Company\'s ability to take the action
otherwise permitted by Sections 5.1 and 5.3:   (i) from and after the date
of such Change in the Company  Recommendation, in performing its obligations
under this Section  5.3, the Company shall not be obligated to solicit from
holders  of shares of Company Common Stock proxies in favor of the  adoption
of this Agreement or to take all action necessary or  advisable to secure, at
the Stockholders Meeting, the Company  Stockholder Approval, but instead
shall be obligated to solicit  impartially from holders of shares of Company
Common Stock  proxies to be voted at the Stockholders Meeting (making no 
instructions to vote in favor or against, but merely to return a  completed
proxy card or cards) and to take all action necessary  or advisable to
maximize, at the Stockholders Meeting, the number  of proxies submitted by
holders of Company Common Stock;   (ii) the Company shall be obligated to
vote all unspecified  but executed proxies submitted by holders of shares of
Company  Common Stock after the Change in the Company Recommendation 
proportionately in accordance with the manner in which all  specified proxies
shall have been voted;   (iii) Parent and its affiliates and agents shall
have the  right, as a participant in the Company\'s solicitation of
proxies,  to communicate with and solicit from holders of shares of Company 
Common Stock the submission of Company proxies in favor of the  adoption of
this Agreement and to take all actions necessary or  advisable to secure, at
the Stockholders Meeting, the Company  Stockholders Approval and otherwise to
act as a participant in  the Company\'s solicitation, all in accordance with
applicable  Law; and   (iv) The parties shall cooperate with each other
in  connection with any actions taken in connection with the  Stockholders
Meeting and make any filings under federal  securities Laws required in
connection herewith.   5.4 Filings; Other Action. (a) Subject to the terms
and conditions herein provided, each of the Company, Parent and
Purchaser shall: (i) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one
another in (A) determining which filings are required or advisable to be made
prior to the Effective Time with, and which consents, approvals, permits
or authorizations are required or advisable to be obtained prior to
the Effective Time from, Governmental Entities or other third parties
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Option Agreement, the Transaction Support Agreement and any other
Ancillary Documents to which it is a party and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (B) timely making all such
filings and timely seeking all such consents, approvals, permits,
authorizations and waivers; and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all other action and do, or cause to be done, all other
things necessary, proper or appropriate to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Option Agreement,
the Transaction Support Agreement and the Ancillary Documents to which it is
a party. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action
is necessary or desirable to carry out the purpose of this Agreement,
the proper officers and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall take all such necessary action.   (b) In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act and any
other Regulatory Law (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date
hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and
any other Regulatory Law and to take all other actions necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
and any Regulatory Law as soon as practicable. Nothing in this Agreement
shall require any of Parent and its Subsidiaries or the Company and its
Subsidiaries to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their
business in a specified manner, or agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of or conduct their business in a specified manner, or permit the
sale, holding separate or other disposition of, any assets of Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries or the conduct of their business in
a specified manner, whether as a condition to obtaining any approval from
a Governmental Entity or any other person or for any other
reason ("Regulatory Restrictions").   (c) Each of Parent and the Company

private party, (ii) promptly inform the other party of any communication
received by such party from, or given by such party to, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the Federal Trade
Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity and of any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a
private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by
it to, and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other Governmental Entity or, in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and
to the extent appropriate or permitted by the DOJ, the FTC or such other
applicable Governmental Entity or other person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences. For
purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory Law" means the Sherman Act, as
amended, Council Regulation No. 4064/89 of the European Community, as amended
(the "EC Merger Regulation") the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the
Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, the Foreign Acquisition and

orders, decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate (A)
foreign investment, (B) antitrust or competition law or (C)
telecommunications.   (d) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in Section 5.4(a) and 5.4(b), if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party,
is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Regulatory Law (a
"Regulatory Challenge"), each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate in
all respects with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts
in order to contest and resist any such Regulatory Challenge and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (e) If any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Regulatory Law or if any suit is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any
private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as
violative of any Regulatory Law, each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts and cause its respective Subsidiaries to use their
reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or challenge as such
Governmental Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such
Regulatory Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   (f) If, primarily as a result of the execution by
Parent or any Subsidiary thereof of a Restricted Acquisition Agreement, the
consents, approvals, permits or authorizations described in this Section 5.4
hereof are not obtained by (i) the date that is 180 days from the date
hereof, then (A) the Merger Consideration shall be increased by an
amount calculated in accordance with Section 2.2(a) hereof, and (B) from and
after such 180th day, Parent and Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived (I)
the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) relating to the failure of
any representation or warranty set forth in Section 3.8, Section 3.9, the
third sentence of Section 3.10(a), the sixth sentence of Section 3.11(a),
Section 3.12 (other than clause (c) thereto), Sections 3.13(b) and (c),
Section 3.16(c) or Section 3.22, to be true and correct as of the Effective
Time where such failure to be true and correct would reasonably be expected
to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, and (II) the condition
set forth in Section 6.2(e) hereof, in either of clause (I) or (II) to
the extent such condition otherwise would fail to be satisfied primarily as
a result of any event, change, development or circumstance occurring
after such 180th day or (ii) March 31, 2002, then Parent shall, or shall
cause any applicable Subsidiary to, promptly terminate the Restricted
Acquisition Agreement. In this regard, Parent shall not, and shall not permit
any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into any Restricted Acquisition Agreement
unless such Restricted Acquisition Agreement permits Parent or such
Subsidiary to terminate such Restricted Acquisition Agreement under the
circumstances described above in clause (ii) of this Section 5.4(f). As used
herein, (x) "Restricted Acquisition" shall mean (A) a merger, reorganization,
share exchange, consolidation, or similar transaction involving Parent or any

in nature to the foregoing with a Restricted Person that would otherwise
be subject to any Regulatory Law, (y) "Restricted Acquisition Agreement"
shall mean any memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, letter
of intent, contract or agreement (whether written or oral) related to

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) give Parent, its officers and a
reasonable number of its employees and its authorized representatives,
reasonable access at all reasonable times during normal business hours to the
Contracts, books, records, analysis, projections, plans, systems, personnel,
commitments, offices and other facilities and properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their accountants and accountants\' work papers and (ii)
furnish Parent on a timely basis with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to the business and properties of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as Parent may from time to time reasonably request and
use reasonable best efforts to make available at all reasonable times
during normal business hours to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, financing sources and other representatives of the Parent the
appropriate individuals (including management personnel, attorneys,
accountants and other professionals) for discussion of the Company\'s
business, properties, prospects and personnel as Parent may reasonably
request.   (b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing,
Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) give the Company,
its officers and a reasonable number of its employees and its
authorized representatives, reasonable access at all reasonable times during
normal business hours to the contracts, books, records, analysis,
projections, plans, systems, personnel, commitments, offices and other

accountants and accountants\' work papers and (ii) furnish the Company on a
timely basis with such financial and operating data and other information
with respect to the business and properties of Parent and its Subsidiaries as
the Company may from time to time reasonably request and use reasonable
best efforts to make available at all reasonable times during normal
business hours to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financing
sources and other representatives of the Company the appropriate
individuals (including management personnel, attorneys, accountants and
other professionals) for discussion of Parent\'s business, properties,
prospects and personnel as the Company may reasonably request.   (c) As
soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
permit Parent to electronically link the Company\'s financial reporting
system to Parent\'s financial reporting system ("Hyperion"). Access to
Hyperion will be provided by Parent\'s financial reporting staff and the
tasks necessary to complete the link to Hyperion will be led by Parent\'s
accounting staff, with the necessary assistance from the Company\'s
accounting staff and other technical staff, if necessary, at no cost to the
Company and provided that neither such installment nor the operation or use
by Parent of Hyperion shall interfere with or disrupt the normal operation of
the Company\'s business or its financial reporting system or violate any
applicable software licenses. Parent will provide the necessary Hyperion
software to be installed on a computer in the Company\'s accounting
department; provided, however, that the information retrieved from the
Company\'s financial reporting system will not be made available to persons
who are directly involved in pricing or any other competitive activity at
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent; provided, further, that Parent shall not
use such information other than for purposes of assessing the financial
condition of the Company for purposes of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and shall not share, provide or sell the information to any
third party or use the information in any manner that could reasonably be
considered a restraint on competition or result in a violation of any
applicable Laws. Any information provided under this Section 5.5(c) shall be
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.   (d) All such
information provided to or obtained by Parent under this Section 5.5 shall be
subject to the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.   5.6
Publicity. The initial press release relating to this Agreement shall be
issued jointly by the Company and Parent in a form previously agreed upon by
the Company and Parent. Thereafter, Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall
consult with each other, and use reasonable efforts to agree upon the text of
any press release, before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other
parties, which shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that
any party may, without the prior consent of the others, issue such press
release or make such public statement as may, upon the advice of counsel, be
required by law or the rules and regulations of the SEC or the NYSE, in
advance of obtaining such prior consent, in which case, the parties shall
cooperate to reach mutual agreement as to the language of any such report,
statement or press release.   5.7 Further Action. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, but without limiting
the rights of the parties hereunder, each of the parties agrees to use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties
in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Option Agreement and
the Transaction Support Agreement, including using its reasonable best
efforts to accomplish the following:   (a) the taking of all acts
reasonably necessary to cause the Closing to be satisfied as promptly as
practicable;   (b) subject to Section 5.4, the obtaining of all
necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings (including filings with Governmental Entities), including,
without limitation, filings pursuant to the FCC Act and any other required
filings or approvals under the telecommunications regulatory laws of
any jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries holds
Company Permits, and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain
an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by,
a Governmental Entity;   (c) the obtaining of all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties;   (d) the defending of any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement, the Option Agreement, the Transaction Support
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby;   (e) taking all necessary actions to prevent the entry
of Restraints (as hereinafter defined) and to appeal as promptly as
possible any such Restraints that may be entered; and   (f) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement, the Option Agreement and the Transaction Support
Agreement.   5.8 Insurance; Indemnity.   (a) Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect for not less than six years after
the Effective Time, the Company\'s current directors\' and officers\'
insurance policies, if such insurance is obtainable (or policies equivalent
in all material respects to those maintained by or on behalf of the Company
and its Subsidiaries on the date hereof, and having at least the same
coverage and containing terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
current and all former directors and officers of the Company) with respect to
acts or failures to act prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
in order to maintain or procure such coverage, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to maintain or obtain policies providing
such coverage except to the extent such coverage can be provided at an annual
cost of no greater than two times the most recent annual premium paid by the
Company prior to the date hereof (the "Cap"); and provided, further, that if
equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an
annual premium in excess of the Cap, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be required to only obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by
paying an annual premium equal to the Cap.   (b) From and after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, each person
who is, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior
to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party") against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or
pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in
their capacities as such, which acts or omissions occurred prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (an "Action"), the Surviving Corporation shall control the
defense of such Action with counsel selected by the Surviving Corporation,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall be permitted to
participate in the defense of such Action through counsel selected by the
Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation, at the Indemnified Party\'s expense. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if there is any conflict between the Surviving Corporation and
any Indemnified Parties or there are additional defenses available to any
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties shall be permitted to
participate in the defense of such Action with counsel selected by the
Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel, as accrued and in
advance of the final disposition of such Action to the full extent permitted
by applicable law; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall
not be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action except to the extent
that the Surviving Corporation and any Indemnified Party have conflicting
interests in the outcome of such Action.   (c) Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to keep in effect for a period of not less than six
years from the Effective Time (or, in the case of matters occurring prior to
the Effective Time which have not been resolved prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, until such matters are finally resolved)
all provisions in the Surviving Corporation\'s Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws that provide for exculpation of director and officer liability and
indemnification (and advancement of expenses related thereto) of the past and
present officers and directors of the Company to the fullest extent permitted
by the DGCL, and such provisions shall not be amended except as either
required by applicable Law or to make changes permitted by Law that would
enhance the rights of past or present officers and directors to
indemnification or advancement of expenses.   (d) If Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or other entity
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of the
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume
all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.   (e) The provisions
of this Section 5.8 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.   5.9 Employee Benefit Plans. (a) For a period of one
year following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to continue to provide employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Employee") as of the Effective Time and former
employees who, as of the Effective Time, have satisfied the requirements for
benefits under any Company Benefit Plan (and their eligible dependents)
employee benefits on terms substantially identical to those provided by the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof, and such employee
benefits shall be provided by means of plans, policies and arrangements that
are substantially identical to the Company Benefit Plans. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (i) except as otherwise provided in Section 5.9(d), the terms
of the plans, policies or arrangements (including, without
limitation, eligibility policies) by which Parent provides equity-based
incentives to employees of the Surviving Corporation for such one-year period
shall not be required to be substantially similar to any Company Stock Option
Plan or the Subsidiary Plans (including, without limitation, eligibility
policies); provided that Company Employees shall participate or not
participate in Parent equity-based plans, policies and arrangements on the
same basis as similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries,
and (ii) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain the
Galileo International L.L.C. Severance Plan and the severance plan of
any Subsidiary listed in Schedule 5.9(a) (each a "Severance Plan"), as
in effect as of the date hereof, with respect to any eligible Company
Employee who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
the Effective Time and whose employment is terminated (A) during the one-
year period commencing at the Effective Time (the "Measurement Period") for
any reason other than cause as determined under such Plan, or (B) from
and after the end of the Measurement Period, as a result of (I) the Merger
or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, on account of any combination, restructuring or
reorganization of operations or facilities, or reduction in force, provided
that, during the Measurement Period, the Parent provides written notification
of such termination to the Company Employee, or (II) any combination,
restructuring or reorganization of operations or facilities, or reduction in
force not related to the Merger and set forth in Disclosure Schedule
5.9(a).   (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, pay and perform all
of their respective covenants and obligations (i) with respect to
the Strategic Alternative Bonus Payments as set forth in paragraph 5
of Disclosure Schedule 5.2, (ii) under all employment, stock plan,
severance, termination protection, consulting and other employee agreements
between the Company or its Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in accordance with the
terms thereof as in effect immediately prior to the date hereof, and (iii)
the Company Benefit Plans, in each case, to the extent disclosed on the
Company Disclosure Letter.   (c) For purposes of determining eligibility
and vesting (but not for benefit accrual) under any Parent benefit plans,
each Company Employee shall be credited with their years of service with the
Company or its Subsidiaries (except to the extent necessary to avoid the
duplication of benefits). To the extent that any Parent benefit plan in which
a Company Employee participates after the Effective Time provides medical,
dental, vision or other welfare benefits, Parent shall cause (i) all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements of such plan
to be waived for such Company Employee and his or her covered dependents,
and (ii) any eligible expenses incurred by such Company Employee on or
before the Effective Time to be taken into account under such plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-
pocket requirements applicable to such Company Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year.   (d) (i) Effective
immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be granted to
each employee or officer of the Surviving Corporation who was, as of the
Effective Time, (i) a Company Employee or an officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and (ii) eligible for an award under a Company Stock Option
Plan (an "Option Eligible Employee"), options to purchase Parent Common Stock
under Parent\'s stock option plans ("Parent Option Plan"), as in effect at
the Effective Time, at fair market value (as defined in such plan) on the
date of grant on such terms as apply as of the date hereof, to similarly
situated employees of Parent, where applicable (or with respect to Non-
Management Employees and Managers, on terms at least as favorable as those
terms applicable to participants in Parent\'s stock option plans in the
closest salary grade to such Company Employees immediately prior to the
Effective Time), except that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the number of
such options shall be determined as set forth in Section 5.9(d)(ii) and
shall become vested in accordance with the following vesting
schedule:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Vesting
Date Cumulative Vested
Percentage ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- First
anniversary of date of grant
25% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Second
anniversary of date of grant
50% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Third
anniversary of date of grant
100% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  
(ii) In connection with the option award described in  Section 5.9(d)(i),
prior to the Effective Time, the Company\'s  Compensation Committee shall
designate with respect to each  Option Eligible Employee a number of options
to purchase Company  Common Stock ("Designated Number"), based on the
following ("2001  Option Awards"): (A) in the category of Non-Management
Employee  or Manager, the target number of options set forth in Schedule 
5.9(d) applicable to such Option Eligible Employee, or (B) with  respect to
the categories of Chief Executive Officer, Executive  and Senior Vice
President, Director and Vice President of Galileo  International, L.L.C., the
number of options derived under the  formulaic target listed in Schedule
5.9(d); provided that, with  respect to clause (B), in each individual case,
such award may  exceed such target, but in no event shall the aggregate
awards  with respect to all such Option Eligible Employees exceed 105% of 
the aggregate targets otherwise applicable to all such employees.  In lieu of
any 2001 Option Awards, Parent shall grant the number  of options to purchase
Parent Stock to be awarded to each such  Option Eligible Employee pursuant to
this Section 5.9(d)(ii) by  multiplying the Designated Number by the Option
Exchange Ratio in  accordance with Section 2.2(c)(i), assuming for purposes
of  Section 2.2(c)(i)(2)(A) and (B), such options had been granted  prior to
the Effective Time.   (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
the  Effective Time occurs after December 31, 2001, in lieu of the  awards
described in Section 5.9(d)(i) and (ii), the Company shall  be entitled to
grant, prior to the Effective Time, the 2001  Option Awards on the same terms
and conditions as in effect with  respect to such Option Eligible Employees
as of the date hereof  (and further providing, with respect to Vice
Presidents and  director level employees who are Option Eligible Employees,
for  the immediate vesting of such options in the event that such 
employee\'s employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries is  terminated
other than for Cause, as defined in the Form of Stock  Option Agreement
applicable as of the date hereof to Executive  Vice Presidents of Galileo
International L.L.C., within two years  after the Effective Time), except
that in no event shall the  Company award any 2001 Option Awards to any
person, including the  Chief Executive Officer or any Executive Vice
President or Senior  Vice President, to the extent that such grant or any
accelerated  vesting of such options as a result of the Merger would,
either  alone or in conjunction with another event, result in an "excess 
parachute payment" within the meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(2)  ("280G
Persons"), provided, however, that all 280G Persons shall  be included in the
option grant described in Sections 5.9(d)(i)  and (ii). Notwithstanding
Section 2.2(c)(i), the 2001 Options  awarded by the Company pursuant to this
Section 5.9(d)(iii) shall  not become vested at or prior to the Effective
Time; provided  that Parent reserves the right to cause such awards to
become  vested immediately prior to the Effective Time.   5.10 Conveyance
Taxes. The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution
and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are required or
permitted to be filed on or before the Effective Time. Each of Parent and the
Company shall pay, without deduction from any amount payable to holders of
Company Common Stock and without reimbursement from the other party, any such
Taxes or fees imposed on it by any Governmental Entity (and/or for which its
shareholders are primarily liable), which becomes payable in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   5.11 Certain Tax
Matters. (a) During the period from the date hereof to the Effective Time,
the Company shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to: (i) timely
file all Tax Returns ("Post Signing Returns") required to be filed by it and,
subject to Section 5.2(b)(xviii), such Post Signing Returns shall be prepared
in a manner consistent with past practice, (ii) timely pay all Taxes due and
payable in respect of such Post Signing Returns that are so filed, (iii)
accrue a reserve in its books and records and financial statements, in
accordance with past practice, for all Taxes payable by it for which no Post
Signing Return is due prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) promptly notify
Parent of any federal or state income or franchise, or other material tax,
suit, claim, action, investigation, proceeding or audit pending against or
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Tax
matters (or any significant developments with respect to any ongoing Tax
matters), including material Tax liabilities and material refund claims.  
(b) Neither the Company nor Parent nor their respective affiliates shall
directly or indirectly (without the consent of the other) take any action or
fail to take any action, that would reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code.   (c) Officers of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
shall execute and deliver to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP
("Skadden Arps"), tax counsel to Parent, and Jones Day, tax counsel to the
Company, certificates substantially in the form agreed to by the parties and
such law firms at such time or times as may be reasonably requested by such
law firms, including contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement,
at the time the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement is declared effective by the
SEC and at the Effective Time, in connection with such tax counsel\'s
respective delivery of opinions, pursuant to Sections 6.2(e) and 6.3(d)
hereof, with respect to the tax treatment of the Merger.   (d) None of
Parent, Purchaser or the Company shall take or cause to be taken any action
which would cause to be untrue (or fail to take or cause not to be taken any
action which would cause to be untrue) any of the certifications and
representations included in the certificates described in Section
5.11(b).   5.12 Section 16 Matters. The Company and Parent shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to the Company
Common Stock) and the acquisition of Parent Common Stock, as the case may
be, resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each officer or director of the Company who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange
Act, such steps to be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter,
dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden Arps.   5.13 Stock
Options and SARs. By adopting or approving this Agreement the Board of
Directors of each of the Company and Parent shall be deemed to have approved
and authorized, and the stockholders of the Company shall be deemed to have
approved and ratified, each and every amendment to (and such other actions in
respect of ) the Company Stock Option Plans, the Company ESPP, and the
agreements evidencing awards under the Company Stock Option Plans and the
Company ESPP as the officers of the Company and Parent may deem necessary or
appropriate to give effect to the provisions of Section 2.2(c).   5.14

approved for listing on the NYSE prior to the Effective Time, subject to
official notice of issuance, the Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger and any and all shares of Parent Common Stock to be reserved for
issuance upon exercise of the Assumed Options.   5.15 Amendments to the

amend, modify or waive any provision of the Rights Agreement, take any action
to redeem the Rights, or render the Rights inapplicable to any Third-Party

any Third-Party Proposal.   5.16 Affiliates. As soon as practicable after
the date hereof, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter identifying all
persons who may be deemed, at the time this Agreement is submitted for

reasonable best efforts to cause each such person to deliver to Parent at
least 30 days prior to the Closing Date a written agreement substantially in
the form attached as Exhibit B hereto.   ARTICLE VI   Conditions   6.1

Affiliate Letter  Dear Sirs:   The undersigned, a holder of shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Company Common Stock"), of Galileo
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), acknowledges
that the undersigned may be deemed an "affiliate" of the Company within the
meaning of Rule 145 ("Rule 145") promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), although nothing contained herein should be construed
as an admission of either such fact. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of June 15, 2001, among Cendant Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Galaxy Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and the
Company, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"),
and in connection with the Merger, the undersigned is entitled to receive
common stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Parent Common Stock"), of
Parent.   If in fact the undersigned were an affiliate under the
Securities Act, the undersigned\'s ability to sell, assign or transfer the
shares of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for any
shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger may be
restricted unless such transaction is registered under the Securities Act or
an exemption from such registration is available. The undersigned
understands that such exemptions are limited and the undersigned has obtained
or will obtain advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions of
such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to
the sale of such securities of Rules 144 and 145(d) promulgated under
the Securities Act. The undersigned understands that Parent will not
be required to maintain the effectiveness of any registration statement
under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale of Parent Common Stock by
the undersigned.   The undersigned hereby represents to and covenants with
Parent that the undersigned will not sell, assign or transfer any of the
shares of Parent Common Stock received by the undersigned in exchange for
shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger except (i)
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,
(ii) in conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule 145 or (iii)
in a transaction which, in the opinion of counsel to the undersigned,
such counsel to be reasonably satisfactory to Parent and such opinion to be
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or as described in
a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the Staff of the SEC
specifically issued with respect to a transaction to be engaged in by the
undersigned, is not required to be registered under the Securities Act.  
In the event of a sale or other disposition by the undersigned of the shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Rule 145, the undersigned will supply
Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in the form of a letter in
the form of Annex I hereto or the opinion of counsel or no-action letter
referred to above. The undersigned understands that Parent may instruct its
transfer agent to withhold the transfer of any shares of Parent Common Stock
disposed of by the undersigned, but that (provided such transfer is not
prohibited by any other provision of this letter agreement) upon receipt of
such evidence of compliance, Parent shall cause the transfer agent to
effectuate the transfer of the shares of Parent Common Stock sold as
indicated in such letter.   Parent covenants that it will take all such
actions as may be reasonably available to it to permit the sale or other
disposition of the shares of Parent Common Stock by the undersigned under
Rule 145 in accordance with the terms thereof.   The undersigned
acknowledges and agrees that the legend set forth below will be placed on
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock received by the
undersigned in connection with the Merger or held by a transferee thereof,
which legend will be removed by delivery of substitute certificates upon
receipt of an opinion in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent
from counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such legend
is no longer required for purposes of the Securities Act.   There will be
placed on the certificates for Parent Common Stock issued to the undersigned
in connection with the Merger, or any substitutions therefor, a legend
stating in substance:   "The shares represented by this certificate were
issued, in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities
Act of 1933 applies. The shares have not been acquired by the holder with a
view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933. The shares may not be sold,
pledged or otherwise transferred except in accordance with an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."   It is
understood and agreed that certificates with the legend set forth above will
be substituted by delivery of certificates without such legends if (i) one
year shall have elapsed from the date the undersigned acquired the Parent
Common Stock received in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are
then available, (ii) two years shall have elapsed from the date the
undersigned acquired the Parent Common Stock received in the Merger and the
provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then available or (iii) Parent has received
either a written opinion of counsel, which opinion of counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a "no-action" letter obtained by the
undersigned from the SEC, to the effect that the restrictions imposed by Rule
145 under the Securities Act no longer apply to the undersigned.   The
undersigned acknowledges that (i) the undersigned has carefully read this
letter and understands the requirements hereof and the limitations imposed
upon the distribution, sale, transfer or other disposition of Parent Common
Stock and (ii) the receipt by Parent of this letter is an inducement to
Parent\'s obligations to consummate the Merger.   Very truly
yours,       Dated: ______________, 2001     ANNEX I  TO EXHIBIT

amended (the "Securities Act").   The undersigned hereby represents that

Section 4(4) of the Securities Act or in transactions directly with a "market
maker" as that term is defined in Section 3(a)(38) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. The undersigned further represents that the
undersigned has not solicited or arranged for the solicitation of orders to
buy the Securities, and that the undersigned has not made any payment in
connection with the offer or sale of the Securities to any person other than
to the broker who executed the order in respect of such sale.   Very truly
yours,            '
