board of directors of Parent until the earlier of their resignation or removal
or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed, in each
case, with effect immediately after the Effective Time ((i) and (ii),
collectively, the " _Parent Board Expansion_ ").

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF COMPANY SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1  _Effect on Share Capital_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of the holders of any common shares of the Company,
each having a par value of US$1.00 (each, a " _Company Common Share_ "), as
evidenced by share certificates registered in the name of a shareholder and
representing outstanding Company Common Shares (each, a " _Company
Certificate_ ") and by way of entry in the register of shareholders of the
Company (the " _Company Share Register_ "):

(a)  _Conversion of Company Common Shares_. Each Company Common Share issued
and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other than Dissenting
Shares) shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive ( _A_ )
0.04315 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable Parent voting common shares, without par value (each, a " _Parent
Common Share_ "), together with any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares
in 

 



3  accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_ (collectively, the " _Stock Consideration_
") and ( _B_ ) $10.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_
", and together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Consideration_ "). Upon
such conversion, each Company Common Share shall be cancelled and each holder
of a Company Common Shares registered in the Company Share Register
immediately before the Effective Time shall thereafter cease to have any
rights with respect to such Company Common Shares except the right to receive
the Consideration. The Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or similar distribution of securities
convertible into Parent Common Shares or Company Common Shares),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Shares or Company Common Shares having a record date
on or following the date hereof and before the Effective Time, it being
understood that ( _i_ ) the intent of such adjustment is to provide
the holders of Company Common Shares with the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement before any such change
and ( _ii_ ) nothing in this _Section 2.1(a)_ shall be construed to permit
the Company or Parent to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

(b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned Securities_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, all Company Common Shares that are held by the
Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or by any Subsidiary of Parent
immediately before the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger, and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, automatically be
cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease
to exist, and no payment shall be made in respect thereof.

(c) _Shares of Dissenting Holders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive the fair value thereof under section
106(2) of the Companies Act. The Company shall give Parent ( _i_ ) prompt
notice of ( _A_ ) any demands for appraisal of Dissenting Shares or attempted
withdrawal or withdrawals of such demands received by the Company and any
other instruments served under the Companies Act and received by the Company
relating to any Dissenting Shareholders right to be paid the fair value of
such Dissenting Shareholders Dissenting Shares and ( _B_ ) to the extent that
the Company has Knowledge, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda
for appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and ( _ii_ ) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with the
Company in any and all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
any written demands for appraisal under the Companies Act. Neither the
Company nor Parent shall, without the prior written consent of the other
party, voluntarily make any payment with

 



4  respect to, or settle, or offer to settle, any such demands or applications,
or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal or
timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in accordance with
the Companies Act.

(d) Each common share of the Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share, par value US$1.00 per share, of the Surviving
Company.

 

Section 2.2 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At least five Business Days before the Effective Time,
Parent shall designate an exchange and paying agent reasonably acceptable to
the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging Company
Common Shares outstanding immediately before the Effective Time. On the
Closing Date, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent in accordance with this  _Article II_ , ( _i_ ) certificates,
or at Parents option, shares in book-entry form representing Parent Common
Shares to be exchanged in the Merger and ( _ii_ ) cash (which, for the
avoidance of doubt may include the proceeds of the Alterra Insurance Company
Dividend) in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration
payable under _Section 2.1(a)_ and any cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares under _Section 2.2(e)_. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit promptly, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent cash in
respect of any dividends or distributions to which the shareholders of the
Company may be entitled under  _Section 2.2(c)_ in an amount sufficient to
pay such dividends or distributions to shareholders of the Company that have
not, as of such date, exchanged their Company Common Shares. Such
Consideration and cash so deposited are hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund." No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Company Common Shares on cash amounts payable under this
_Section 2.2_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in the Exchange Fund
as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in direct
obligations of or fully guaranteed by the United States of America or in money
market funds having a rating in the highest investment category granted by
a recognized credit rating agency at the time of investment. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be promptly paid to Parent
and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under _Section 2.2(b)_, 
_2.2(c)_ and _2.2(e)_ shall be promptly returned to Parent. To the extent that
there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or such cash
diminishes for any reason below the level required for the Exchange Agent to
make prompt cash payment of amounts under _Section 2.2(b)_, _2.2(c)_ and
_2.2(e)_ , Parent shall promptly replace or restore the cash so as to ensure
that there is sufficient cash for the Exchange Agent to make all such
payments.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time and in any
event not later than five Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent
or the Surviving Company shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, to each
shareholder of the

 



5  Company, ( _i_ ) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as the parties may reasonably specify at least
three Business Days before the Effective Time), and ( _ii_ ) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of Company Common Shares in exchange for the
Consideration. Following the Effective Time, upon surrender of title to the
Company Common Shares previously held by a shareholder of the Company in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_, together with such letter of transmittal
duly executed and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
require, a holder of Company Common Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor ( _A_ ) a certificate or book-entry representing that number
of whole Parent Common Shares (rounded down) which such shareholder has the
right to receive in respect of the Company Common Shares after taking into
account all Company Common Shares then held by such shareholder, ( _B_ ) any
cash in lieu of fractional shares that such shareholder has the right to
receive under _Section 2.2(e)_ and ( _C_ ) the amount of the Cash
Consideration which such shareholder has the right to receive in respect of
the Company Common Shares and any Company Certificate surrendered in respect
thereof shall forthwith be marked as cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, a certificate or book-entry representing the proper
number of Parent Common Shares may be issued to a transferee if the Company
Certificate representing such Company Common Shares (if any) is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by documents normally required to evidence and
effect such transfer (reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and by reasonable
evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Shares with a
record date on or following the Effective Time shall be paid to any
shareholder of the Company holding any unexchanged Company Common Shares with
respect to Parent Common Shares represented thereby, nor shall any Cash
Consideration or the cash payment in lieu of fractional shares be paid to any
such shareholder under _Section 2.2(e)_, until such shareholder shall
exchange such Company Common Shares in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this _Article II_. Following the exchange of any such Company Common
Shares in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Article II_ , such
shareholder shall be entitled to receive, in addition to the Consideration
set forth in _Section 2.1(a)_, without interest, ( _i_ ) at the time of such
exchange, the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record
date on or following the Effective Time theretofore paid (but withheld under
the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to such whole Parent Common
Shares that a shareholder holding such Company Common Shares is entitled to
receive hereunder and ( _ii_ ) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date on or following the
Effective Time but before exchange and a payment date after the exchange
payable with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares that a shareholder
holding such Company Common Shares is entitled to receive hereunder.

 



6 (d) _No Further Rights in Company Common Shares_. All Consideration paid or
issued upon the surrender of title to Company Common Shares in accordance
with the terms of this _Article II_ (including any cash paid under this
_Article II_ ) shall be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shareholders of the Company in
their capacity as shareholders of the Company before the Effective Time. There
shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer books of
the Surviving Company of the Company Common Shares that were outstanding
immediately before the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Company
Certificates are presented to Parent or to the Surviving Company or to the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be marked as cancelled
and exchanged in accordance with this _Article II_ , except as otherwise
required by applicable Law.

(e) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no fraction of a Parent Common Share shall be issued in connection
with the Merger, and in lieu thereof any shareholder of the Company who would
otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share, shall be
paid upon surrender of Company Common Shares for exchange (and after taking
into account and aggregating Company Common Shares represented by all Company
Certificates surrendered by such holder, or as set out in the Company Share
Register, as applicable) cash in an amount (without interest) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying ( _i_ ) the fractional share interest to which
such shareholder (after taking into account and aggregating all Company
Common Shares represented by all Company Certificates surrendered by such
shareholder, or as set out in the Company Share Register, as applicable) would
otherwise be entitled by ( _ii_ ) the Average Parent Share Price.

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Company Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Consideration and any
dividends or other distributions as may be required under this _Article II_
in respect of the Company Common Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Company Certificates; _provided_ that Parent may, in its reasonable
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in such
sum as it may reasonably direct or otherwise indemnify Parent in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Parent against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Company Certificates alleged
to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Unless a longer period is prescribed by
applicable Law or Parents agreement with the Exchange Agent, any portion of
the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the shareholders of the
Company for one year following the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any shareholders of the Company who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
Parent for payment of their claim for the Consideration and any dividends or
distributions with respect to Parent Common Shares.

 



7 (h) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted under applicable Law, any
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable to any
shareholder of the Company in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_ that remain
undistributed to the shareholders of the Company shall be delivered to and
become the property of Parent on the Business Day immediately before the day
that such property is required to be delivered to any public official under
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding
anything in the Agreement to the contrary, to the extent permitted under
applicable Law, none of Parent, the Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any shareholder of the Company for any such
property delivered to Parent or to a public official under any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(i) _Withholding_. The Exchange Agent, Parent, and the Surviving
Company (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable under this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent, Parent, or the Surviving Company, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made. The parties agree to cooperate reasonably with each other for
purposes of determining whether any Taxes are required to be withheld with
respect to the Merger.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Company Stock Options and other Company Stock-Based
Awards_.

 

(a) Each right to purchase Company Common Shares granted by the Company under
the Company Share Plans that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
before or as of the Effective Time (the " _Company Stock Options_ "), whether
or not exercisable and whether or not vested, at the Effective Time, shall
remain outstanding following the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, all
of the Company Stock Options shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed in
full by Parent, which shall have assumed the Company Share Plans as of the
Effective Time by virtue of this Agreement and without any further action by
Parent. From and after the Effective Time, all references to the Company in
the Company Share Plans and in any agreement granting or governing Company
Stock Options shall be deemed to refer to Parent. Each Company Stock Option
assumed by Parent (each, a " _Company Converted Option_ ") shall be converted
automatically into an option to purchase Parent Common Shares upon the same
terms and conditions as are in effect immediately before the Effective Time
with respect to such Company Stock Option, including vesting schedule (taking
into account any

 



8  accelerated vesting of such Company Stock Options as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with their terms) and term of
exercise, except ( _i_ ) that each such Company Converted Option shall
represent the right to acquire the number of Parent Common Shares equal to the
number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Stock Option
multiplied by the Incentive Award Exchange Ratio, and ( _ii_ ) that the
exercise price per share of each Company Converted Option shall be an amount
(rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the option exercise price per
share of the related Company Stock Option divided by the Incentive Award
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that the conversion of the Company Converted
Options shall in any event be in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.409A-1(b)(5)(v)(D); and _provided_ _further_ that no fractional
Parent Common Shares shall be issuable upon exercise of each Company Stock
Option, and instead, at the Effective Time, such right to purchase such
fractional share shall be cancelled and the Company shall pay the holder
thereof the value of such fractional Parent Common Share in cash based on the
Average Parent Share Price. For purposes of this Agreement, the "Incentive
Award Exchange Ratio" shall be the sum of (x) plus (y), where (x) is the
Exchange Ratio and (y) is the quotient of (i) the Cash Consideration divided
by (ii) the Average Parent Share Price.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Company Restricted Award that does not become
fully-vested on an accelerated basis as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with their terms shall be assumed in full by
Parent (each, a " _Company Converted Restricted Award_ ") and shall be
converted into the number of restricted Parent Common Shares or restricted
stock units of Parent Common Shares, as applicable, equal to the number of
Company Common Shares underlying such Company Restricted Award in effect
immediately before the Effective Time multiplied by the Incentive Award
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that no fractional restricted Parent Common Shares
shall be issuable upon such conversion, and instead, at the Effective
Time, such right to receive such fractional share shall be cancelled and the
Company shall pay the holder thereof the value of such fractional Parent
Common Share in cash based on the Average Parent Share Price. Each such
Company Converted Restricted Award will otherwise have the same terms and
conditions as the corresponding Company Restricted Award, including vesting
schedule. All other Company Restricted Awards that become fully-vested on an
accelerated basis as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby in
accordance with their terms shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive the Consideration and each holder thereof shall thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such Company Restricted Awards except the
right to receive the Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, all
references to the Company in the Company Share Plans and in any agreement
granting or governing Company Converted Restricted Awards shall be deemed to
refer to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, all Company Restricted Awards
that become fully-vested on an accelerated basis as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with their terms shall be
treated as Company Common Shares in accordance with _Section 2.1_, and
awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted under the
Company Share Plans which became vested

 



9  before the Closing Date in accordance with their terms and not on an
accelerated basis as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
not be considered Company Restricted Awards for purposes of this _Section
2.3_.

(c) Before the Closing, the board of directors of Parent (or the
Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Parent) shall adopt such
resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary or appropriate in
order to effectuate the actions contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, which
such actions shall include: ( _i_ ) reserving for issuance a sufficient
number of Parent Common Shares for delivery upon the exercise of the Company
Converted Options and the issuance of the Company Converted Restricted Awards;
( _ii_ ) as promptly as practicable (and in no event later than five Business
Days following the Effective Time) filing with the SEC a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with
respect to Parent Common Shares subject to the Company Converted Options and
Company Converted Restricted Awards; and ( _iii_ ) such other actions
reasonably requested by the Company to give effect to the foregoing;
_provided_ that such resolutions and actions shall expressly be conditioned
upon the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby and shall be of no force and effect if this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement are terminated. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for as long as any
such Company Converted Options, and Company Converted Restricted Awards remain
outstanding. As promptly as practicable, and in any event not later than ten
Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered, to each holder of a Company Converted Option and Company
Converted Restricted Award a reasonably detailed notice setting forth such
holders rights thereunder. Parent shall comply with the terms of all such
Company Converted Options and Company Converted Restricted Awards and shall
ensure that the conversion and assumption of the Company Stock Options
provided in this _Section 2.3_ shall be effected in a manner consistent with
the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(d) Before the Closing, the board of directors of the Company (or the
Compensation Committee of the board of directors of the Company) shall adopt
such resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary or appropriate
in order to effectuate the actions contemplated by this  _Section 2.3_ and
shall take such other actions reasonably requested by Parent to give effect to
the foregoing, without any obligation to pay any consideration or incur any
debts or obligations on behalf of the Company or any of its respective
Subsidiaries (other than fees and expenses of advisors); _provided_ that such
resolutions and actions shall expressly be conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and shall be
of no force and effect if this Agreement and the Merger Agreement are
terminated.

 



10 (e) The board of directors of Parent, or a committee of "Non-Employee
Directors" thereof (as such term is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d)
under the Exchange Act), in consultation with the Company, shall adopt a
resolution before the Closing providing that the receipt by Company Insiders
of Parent Common Shares in exchange for Company Common Shares (including
Company Converted Restricted Awards) and, as applicable, Company Converted
Options, in each case, under the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based on the Section 16 Information provided by the Company to Parent, are
intended to be exempt from liability under Section 16(b) under the Exchange
Act in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act and additional guidance issued thereunder. 

(f) Following completion of the current offering period ending on December 31,
2012 (and the share purchase relating thereto), notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in _Section 5.9_, ( _i_ ) subsequent offering periods under the
Companys employee stock purchase plan described in _Section 2.3(f)_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter (the " _ESPP_ ") shall be suspended for periods
prior to the Effective Time and ( _ii_ ) prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall provide notice to all participants in the ESPP that the ESPP
will be terminated as soon as practicable following the Effective Time. The
Company shall take all action necessary to give full effect to this _Section
2.3(f)_. ESPP Shares shall be treated as Company Common Shares for all
purposes of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, " _ESPP Shares_ "
shall mean Company Common Shares purchased under an ESPP.

Section 2.4  _Treatment of Company Warrants_. Each outstanding warrant to
purchase Company Common Shares (the " _Company Warrants_ "), whether or not
exercisable at the Effective Time, shall, at the option of the holder
thereof: ( _i_ ) be surrendered to Parent in exchange for an amount equal to
( _A_ )the per share Consideration multiplied by ( _B_ ) the number of Company
Common Shares the holder of such Company Warrant would have received had
such holder exercised such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Closing
(assuming for the purposes of this calculation, the cashless exercise of such
Company Warrant); or ( _ii_ ) remain outstanding following the Effective Time
in accordance with the terms thereof (each such Company Warrant that remains
outstanding following the Effective Time, a " _Company Converted Warrant_ ").
For the avoidance of doubt, following the Effective Time, Company Converted
Warrants will, in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 thereof,
represent a right to purchase, for a price equal to the Exercise Price (as
defined in such Company Converted Warrant) multiplied by the number of Company
Common Shares for which such Company Converted Warrant may have been
exercised immediately prior to the Closing, ( _I_ ) an amount of cash equal to
the Cash Consideration multiplied by the number of Company Common Shares for
which such Company Converted Warrant may have been exercised immediately
prior to the Closing and ( _II_ ) that number of Parent Common Shares equal to
the number of Company Common Shares for which such Company Converted Warrant
may have been exercised immediately prior to the Closing multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, together with any cash paid in lieu of a fractional share in
accordance with the

 



11  terms of the Company Converted Warrants; _provided_ , that, the number of
Parent Common Shares deliverable upon the exercise of the Company Converted
Warrants following the Closing shall be subject to adjustment for events
subsequent to the Closing on terms economically equivalent to those provided
in the Company Converted Warrants. Also for the avoidance of doubt, upon
exercise, to the extent applicable, the holder of any Company Converted
Warrant shall be entitled to receive any evidences of indebtedness, assets
(including cash) or other property such holder would have been entitled to
receive in lieu of an adjustment to the Exercise Price (as defined in the
Company Warrants) in accordance with the terms of such Company Converted
Warrant.

written consent of the shareholders of the Company, subject to applicable
Law.

(i) Parent hereby acknowledges that under the Parent Shareholder Voting
Agreements, each of the shareholders of Parent party thereto has irrevocably
granted to and appointed (subject to _Section 4.2_ of the applicable Parent
Shareholder Voting Agreement) the Company and up to two of the Companys
designated representatives as such shareholders proxy to vote the Parent
Common Shares (and other securities having voting rights) held by such

in the manner specified in the Parent Shareholder Voting Agreements (the "

are subject to a granted Parent Shareholder Proxy in the manner set forth in
Section 4 of the applicable Parent Shareholder Voting Agreement at any meeting
of the shareholders of Parent (including the Parent Shareholder Meeting and
any adjournment or postponement thereof) or in any action by written consent
of the shareholders of Parent, subject to applicable Law.

(l) Except to the extent included in the Company Shareholder Materials with
regard to the Company Shareholder Meeting, the Company shall, concurrently
with the initial delivery thereof, make available to Parent any materials

Voting Agreements in the same manner so delivered.

(m) Except to the extent included in the Parent Shareholder Materials with

Section 5.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each of Parent and the Company shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) ( _i_ ) afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of the
other party, access, during normal business hours during the period before the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, to all
its properties, books, contracts, records and officers and ( _ii_ ) during
such period, make available all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel, in each case, as such other party may reasonably
request. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.2_ or _Section 5.3_ to
the contrary, neither party nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would jeopardize any legally recognized privilege applicable to such
information or violate or contravene any applicable Laws or binding agreement
entered into before the execution of this Agreement (including any Laws
relating to privacy). The parties will take appropriate actions as are
necessary to permit disclosure, including entering into a joint defense
agreement or other arrangement to avoid loss of the attorney-
client privilege, or make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply,
including adopting additional specific procedures to protect the
confidentiality of certain sensitive material and to ensure compliance with
applicable Law, and, if necessary, restricting review of certain sensitive
material to the receiving partys financial advisors or outside legal counsel.
No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation under this _Section
5.2_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made
by any party hereunder.

(b) The parties will hold any such information in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and
effect as provided under _Section 8.5(a)_ up to and until the Closing. The
parties agree that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate immediately
upon the Closing.

 



54 Section 5.3 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and the Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement and applicable Law to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement as
promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of the Company and Parent agrees
to make, as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event not later than ( _i_ ) fifteen Business Days following the date
of this Agreement, the appropriate filings and notifications required by the
Transaction Approvals listed on  _Schedule 5.3(a)_ and ( _ii_ ) 20 Business
Days following the date of this Agreement, all other Transaction Approvals and
other necessary filings and notifications with any other Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Merger Agreement (except with respect to the Bermuda Monetary Authority, which
filings and notifications will be in accordance with customary practice) and
to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be reasonably requested under such requirements.
The Company and Parent will each request early termination of the waiting
period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act.

 

(b) To the extent permissible under applicable Law and in each case regarding
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Merger Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall, in connection with
the efforts referenced above to obtain the Transaction Approvals from
Governmental Entities, to the extent legally permitted, use its reasonable
best efforts to: ( _i_ ) cooperate in all respects with each other in
connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a
private party; ( _ii_ ) promptly inform the other party of any material
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any
Governmental Entity and of any material communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party; ( _iii_ ) give the other
party, or the other partys legal counsel, reasonable opportunity, in advance
of the transmission thereof, to review and comment on any material
communication (and shall address or include, as applicable, in such
communication comments reasonably proposed by the other party) given by it to,
and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with, any
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party,
with any other Person; and ( _iv_ ) unless prohibited by a Governmental Entity
or other Person, give the other party and its legal counsel the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

 



55 (c) Subject to _Section 5.4(c)_, ( _i_ ) Parent shall give the Company
the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of any Legal
Proceedings against Parent or its directors or officers relating to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and ( _ii_ ) the Company
shall give Parent the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
any Legal Proceedings against the Company or its directors or officers
relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) In connection with subsections (a), (b) and (c) above, except as would not
or would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent and its Subsidiaries or the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case,
taken as a whole after giving effect to the Merger (such Material Adverse
Effect, a " _Regulatory Material Adverse Effect_ "), ( _i_ ) neither party
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to sell, divest, hold separate,
or otherwise dispose of any of its or its Subsidiaries, respective businesses,
product lines or assets, ( _ii_ ) Parent shall not be required to conduct the
business of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) taken as a whole after giving effect to the Merger in a
specified manner and ( _iii_ ) neither party, as applicable, shall
be required to agree to take any action or agree to any restriction,
limitation or condition.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any necessary approval or consent from any Person (other than a
Governmental Entity) with respect to the Merger, neither Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries nor the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose necessary approval or consent is being solicited
any material amount of cash or other consideration, make any material
commitment or incur any material liability or other material obligation due
to such Person, as measured with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole after giving
effect to the Merger), in each case, without the prior written consent of
the other party.

(f) From and after the date of this Agreement, the parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause each of the Companys Insurance
Subsidiaries to maintain a Financial Strength Rating from Standard and Poors
Corporation of at least an "A".

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause
its respective Subsidiaries not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
to direct its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, ( _i_ ) solicit, initiate, encourage, or facilitate, any Takeover
Proposal or the making, announcement or consummation thereof, ( _ii_ ) enter
into or otherwise participate in any discussions (except to notify a Person of
the existence of the provisions of this  _Section 5.4_) or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any Person any information (regardless of whether
such information is material or already publicly available) in connection
with, or in furtherance of, any Takeover Proposal, ( _iii_ ) waive,
terminate, modify or fail to enforce any provision of any confidentiality or
"standstill" or similar obligation of any Person (other than the other

 



56  party hereto) with respect to a party or any of its Subsidiaries, ( _iv_ )
approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, adopt or
recommend, any Takeover Proposal or submit to the vote of its shareholders
any Takeover Proposal before the termination of this Agreement, ( _v_ ) enter
into, or approve or recommend or publicly propose to approve or recommend the
entering into of any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
amalgamation or merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement or
understanding relating to any Takeover Proposal before the termination of this
Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in the proviso
to the last sentence of this _Section 5.4(a)_), or ( _vi_ ) authorize any
of, or commit or agree to do any of, the foregoing. Each of Parent and the
Company ( _A_ ) shall, and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to direct its and its Subsidiaries
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the other party hereto
and its Representatives) conducted heretofore with respect to any Takeover
Proposal and ( _B_ ) shall immediately take all steps necessary to terminate
any approval under any confidentiality or "standstill" or similar provision
that may have been heretofore given by Parent or the Company under any such
provisions authorizing any Person to make a Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the restrictions in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and, to the extent
applicable thereto, (vi) of the first sentence of this _Section 5.4(a)_
shall not prohibit Parent or its Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the one
hand, or the Company or its Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the other
hand, at any time before obtaining the Parent Share Issuance Vote or the
Company Merger Vote, as the case may be, from participating in any discussions
or negotiations regarding, furnishing to any Person any information with
respect to, or waiving, modifying or electing not to enforce any
confidentiality or "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person in respect
of a Takeover Proposal (including with respect to the following proviso) that
has been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to its officers or its
board of directors, if its board of directors (or an authorized and empowered
committee thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisor, that such Takeover Proposal
would reasonably be likely to lead to a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that (
_I_ ) before a party furnishing any information to, or negotiating with, any
Person with respect to a Takeover Proposal, such party shall have entered into
a confidentiality agreement with such Person containing confidentiality terms
and "standstill" or similar obligations not less restrictive in the aggregate
to such Person and its Representatives than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent and its Representatives (in the case
of the Company furnishing information to, or negotiating with, any Person) or
the Company and its Representatives (in the case of Parent furnishing
information to, or negotiating with, any Person), and ( _II_ ) all such
information has previously been made available to the Company and its
Representatives (in the case of Parent furnishing information to any Person)
or Parent and its Representatives (in the case of the Company furnishing
information to any Person) or will be so made available substantially
concurrent with the time it is provided to such Person.

 



57 (b) Neither the board of directors of Parent or the Company nor any committee
thereof shall ( _i_ ) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify the Parent
Recommendation (in the case of Parent) or the Company Recommendation (in the
case of the Company) in a manner adverse to the Company or Parent, as
applicable, ( _ii_ ) fail to include the Parent Recommendation (in the case
of Parent) or the Company Recommendation (in the case of the Company) in the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, or ( _iii_ ) recommend or publicly propose
to recommend any Takeover Proposal (any action described in clause (i), (ii)
or (iii) being referred to as a " _Recommendation Withdrawal_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that ( _A_ ) the delivery by a party, its board of directors or an
authorized and empowered committee thereof of any notice specified in
_Section 5.4(d)_ shall not be deemed to be or constitute a Recommendation
Withdrawal, ( _B_ ) the provision of factual information by a party to its
shareholders shall not be deemed to be or constitute a Recommendation
Withdrawal so long as the disclosure through which such factual information is
conveyed, taken as a whole, is not contrary to or materially inconsistent with
the Parent Recommendation (in the case of Parent) or the Company
Recommendation (in the case of the Company), and ( _C_ ) for purposes of the
definition of Recommendation Withdrawal, ( _I_ ) in the case of Parent, the
term "Parent Recommendation" shall refer only to the recommendation by the
board of directors of Parent in respect of the Parent Share Issuance Vote and
( _II_ ) in the case of the Company, the term "Company Recommendation" shall
refer only to the recommendation by the board of directors of the Company in
respect of the Company Merger Vote.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and
subject to compliance with _Section 5.4(d)_: ( _i_ ) at any time before
obtaining the Company Merger Vote, the Companys board of directors (or an
authorized and empowered committee thereof) may make a Recommendation
Withdrawal ( _A_ ) in response to, or as a result of, a material event,
development, occurrence, or change in circumstances or facts, occurring after
the date hereof (which event, development, occurrence, circumstances or facts
was not known to be reasonably likely to occur by the Companys board of
directors (or applicable authorized and empowered committee thereof) as of the
date hereof) (a " _Company Intervening Event_ ") or ( _B_ ) in response to a
Takeover Proposal that the Companys board of directors (or applicable
authorized and empowered committee thereof) shall have determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, constitutes a Superior Proposal, in each case, if the Companys
board of directors (or applicable authorized and empowered committee thereof)
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to violate
its fiduciary (or similar) duties under applicable Law; and ( _ii_ ) at any
time before obtaining the Parent Share Issuance Vote, the board of directors
of Parent (or an authorized and empowered committee thereof) may make a
Recommendation Withdrawal in response to, or as a result of, a material event,
development, occurrence, or change in circumstances or facts, occurring after
the date hereof (which event, development, occurrence, circumstances or facts
was not known to be reasonably likely to occur by Parents board of directors
(or

 



58  applicable authorized and empowered committee thereof) as of the date
hereof) (a " _Parent Intervening Event_ ") if such Parents board of directors
(or applicable authorized and empowered committee thereof) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary (or
similar) duties under applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (x) no event, development, occurrence,
circumstance or fact that affects or relates to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be, or contribute to, any Company Intervening
Event unless such event, development, occurrence, circumstance or fact also
affects or relates to the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and, in such
case, the board of directors of the Company (or applicable authorized
and empowered committee thereof) shall only consider the extent to which such
event, development, occurrence, circumstance or fact affects or relates to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (not including any effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries) in determining whether a Recommendation Withdrawal is
appropriate in response to such Company Intervening Event, (y) no event,
development, occurrence, circumstance or fact that affects or relates to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be, or contribute to,
any Parent Intervening Event unless such event, development, occurrence,
circumstance or fact also affects or relates to Parent and/or any of its
Subsidiaries, and, in such case, the board of directors of Parent
(or applicable authorized and empowered committee thereof) shall only
consider the extent to which such event, development, occurrence, circumstance
or fact affects or relates to Parent and its Subsidiaries (not including any
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries) in determining whether a
Recommendation Withdrawal is appropriate in response to such Parent
Intervening Event and (z) with respect to Parent, no Takeover Proposal shall
be deemed to be a Parent Intervening Event unless (1) such Takeover Proposal
is _bona fide_ and in writing, (2) such Takeover Proposal has not been
obtained in breach of _Section 5.4_ and (3) the board of directors of Parent
(or applicable authorized and empowered committee thereof) has determined, in
the good faith exercise of its fiduciary (or similar) duties, that it shall
recommend such Takeover Proposal to its shareholders. For purposes of this
_Section 5.4(c)_, each reference to "10% or more" in the definition of
"Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "more than 50%." For
the avoidance of doubt, no increase in the share price of Parent or Company
from the date hereof shall be deemed to be a Parent Intervening Event or
Company Intervening Event, respectively, _provided_ that this limitation shall
not prevent or otherwise affect a determination that any material event,
development, occurrence, or change in circumstances or facts underlying such
increase in share price has resulted in a Parent Intervening Event or Company
Intervening Event.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
neither partys board of directors (nor any authorized and empowered committee
thereof) shall be entitled to make a Recommendation Withdrawal under 
_Section 5.4(c)_, unless ( _i_ ) such party shall have provided to the other
party at least three Business Days before taking such action written notice
that it intends to make a Recommendation Withdrawal 

 



59  and specifying the reasons therefor (and, if applicable, the information
required by _Section 5.4(f)_), ( _ii_ ) during such three Business Day
period, if requested by the other party, the party delivering such written
notice shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with the other party
regarding any amendment or waiver to this Agreement proposed by the other
party which shall be kept confidential by such party (except to the extent
required to be disclosed under applicable Law), ( _iii_ ) such party has not
materially breached its obligations under this _Section 5.4_ and ( _iv_ )
solely in the case of a Recommendation Withdrawal by the Companys board of
directors (or an authorized and empowered committee thereof) in response to a
Takeover Proposal, the Companys board of directors (or an authorized and
empowered committee thereof) shall have determined, after taking into account
all amendments and waivers to this Agreement made in response to such Takeover
Proposal, and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that such Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal. The parties agree that any amendment to the financial
terms (which shall include any change in ( _x_ ) the form of consideration or
( _y_ ) the percentage or allocation of form of consideration) or other
material terms and conditions of a Takeover Proposal described in clause (i)
above shall require a party to provide new written notification and shall
commence a new three Business Day period under this _Section 5.4(d)_.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
obligation of each of Parent and the Company to call, give notice of, convene
and hold the Parent Shareholder Meeting (in the case of Parent) and the
Company Shareholder Meeting (in the case of the Company) and to hold a vote of
its shareholders for purposes of obtaining the Required Parent Vote or
the Required Company Vote, as applicable, shall not be limited or otherwise
affected by the commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to it of
any Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) or by a
Recommendation Withdrawal made by it. If a party makes a Recommendation
Withdrawal under _Section 5.4(c)_, ( _i_ ) such party shall nevertheless
submit the matters contemplated by the Required Parent Vote or the Required
Company Vote, as applicable, to a vote of its shareholders and ( _ii_ ) the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Company Shareholder Materials, as
applicable, and any and all accompanying materials may include appropriate
disclosure with respect to such Recommendation Withdrawal in accordance with
applicable Law after consultation with outside legal counsel.

(f) Each party shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours after receipt) advise the other party orally and in writing of ( _i_ )
any Takeover Proposal (or any withdrawal thereof), ( _ii_ ) any request for
information that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal
and ( _iii_ ) any inquiry with respect to, or which would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, such notice to include the
material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal, request or
inquiry (including a copy of any such written Takeover Proposal, request or
inquiry and any amendments or modifications thereto or if oral, a written
summary thereof) and the 

 



60  identity of the Person making the Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry.
Each of Parent and the Company shall keep the other fully informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of any such Takeover Proposal, request
or inquiry, including any changes to the material terms and conditions
thereof. Each party shall as promptly as practical (and in any event within 24
hours after becoming aware thereof) advise the other party orally and
in writing of events, developments, occurrences or changes in circumstance
that resulted in a Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event, as
applicable, in sufficient detail as to allow the other party to analyze and
(if appropriate) respond to such event.

(g) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit a party or its
board of directors from ( _i_ ) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a
position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 under
the Exchange Act (including a "stop, look and listen" communication to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) or ( _ii_ ) making any disclosure to its
shareholders if its board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law;
_provided_ that any such action taken or statement made by a party that
involves or relates to any Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Recommendation Withdrawal by such party unless its board of directors
simultaneously reaffirms the Company Recommendation or Parent Recommendation
(or, in the case of a "stop, look and listen" communication under Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, within three Business Days thereafter); and
_provided_ , _further_ , that any Recommendation Withdrawal only may be made
in accordance with _Section 5.4(c)_ and _Section 5.4(d)_. 

(h) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 5.4_ by any Representatives of the Company (or any of its
Subsidiaries) or of Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries), shall be deemed to be
a breach of this _Section 5.4_ by the Company or Parent, as applicable.

Section 5.5 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expense, except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, and except that out-of-pocket expenses
(excluding fees and disbursements to advisors) incurred in connection with
filing, printing and mailing, as the case may be, of the Parent Registration
Statement, the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, the Company Shareholder
Materials, the pre-merger notification requirements of the HSR Act and any
amendments or supplements thereto shall be shared equally by Parent and the
Company.

 

Section 5.6 _Alterra Insurance Company Dividend_. Without limiting the
generality of _Section 5.3_, promptly following the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do, or

 



61  to cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable, including the
obtaining of all necessary approvals from relevant Governmental Entities, for
Alterra Bermuda Limited to declare and pay one or more cash dividends or
distributions (collectively, the " _Alterra Insurance Company Dividend_ ") to
the Company on or before the Closing Date in the aggregate amount necessary so
that on the Closing Date the Company shall have no less than $500,000,000 in
immediately available unrestricted funds.

Section 5.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall and, to the
extent applicable, shall cause the Surviving Company to, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law (and, in the case of former directors and
officers, to the extent permitted by the bye-laws of the Company in effect
immediately before the Closing), indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of expenses to, each Person who is now, or has been at any
time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries (the " _Company
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses, liabilities, penalties or judgments or amounts that are paid in
settlement of or in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out
of the fact that such Person is or was a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, and pertaining to any matter existing or
occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or before the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed before, at or following, the Effective Time,
including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(b) Subject to _Section 5.7(c)_, the bye-laws of the Surviving Company shall
include provisions for indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of the Company Indemnified Parties at least as favorable as those
set forth in the bye-laws of the Company in effect on the date of
this Agreement. The parties hereby agree that the form of bye-laws attached
hereto as Exhibit C satisfies such requirement. Following the Effective Time,
the Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to,
maintain in effect the provisions in its bye-laws providing for
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Company
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, with respect to the facts or circumstances
occurring at or before the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted
from time to time under applicable Law, which provisions shall not be amended
except as required by applicable Law or except to make changes permitted by
applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of the Company
Indemnified Parties indemnification rights thereunder.

(c) Subject to the remaining provisions of this _Section 5.7(c)_, the
Surviving Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, either ( _i_ ) continue to maintain in effect
for six years from the Effective Time directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance having

 



62  terms and conditions at least as favorable to the Company Indemnified
Parties as the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
and fiduciary liability insurance (the " _Company Current Insurance_ ") with
respect to matters existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including the transactions contemplated hereby), or ( _ii_ ) purchase a six
year extended reporting period endorsement with respect to the Company
Current Insurance (a " _Company Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and maintain
this endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. To the extent
purchased after the date hereof and before the Effective Time, such insurance
policies shall be placed through such broker(s) and with such insurance
carriers as may be specified by the Company and as are reasonably acceptable
to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Company be required to expend for any such policies contemplated by
this _Section 5.7(c)_ an annual premium (measured for purposes of any "tail"
by reference to 1/6th the aggregate premium paid therefor) amount in excess
of 350% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Company shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Company or any of its successors or assigns (
_i_ ) consolidates or amalgamates with or merges into any other Person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
amalgamation or ( _ii_ ) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person (including by dissolution), then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company assume and honor
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7_.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company agree
not to, directly or indirectly, amend, modify, limit or terminate the
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation provisions contained
in the agreements listed in  _Section 5.7(e)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter.

(f) The provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_ through  _(e)_ above: ( _i_ ) are
expressly intended to be for the benefit of, and shall (subject to the second
sentence of _Section 5.7(b)_) be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified
Party, his or her heirs and legal representatives; and ( _ii_ ) are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification
or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

 

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. The press release to be issued after the
execution of this Agreement by all parties regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release and thereafter each of Parent and the Company shall,
except as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations under any

Global Select Market (in the case of the Company) or by request of any
Governmental Entity, give the other party and its Representatives a reasonable
opportunity in advance of issuing any press release or 

 



63  otherwise making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to review and comment on any such press
release or public statement (and shall address or include, as applicable, in
such press release or public statement comments reasonably proposed by the
other party); _provided_ , _however_ , that this consultation obligation shall
not apply to any press release or other public statement relating to any
actual or contemplated dispute among the parties to this Agreement.

Section 5.9 _Employee Benefits_.

(a) As of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its
Subsidiaries to, continue to employ each Person employed by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (such
employees, collectively, the " _Employees_ "). Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall ( _i_ ) restrict Parent in the future in the exercise of its
independent, good-faith business judgment as to the terms and conditions under
which such employment shall continue, the duration of such employment, the
basis on which such employment is terminated or the benefits provided to any
Employee or ( _ii_ ) constitute a guarantee of continued employment of any
Employee.

(b) From the Closing Date through December 31, 2013, Parent shall (or shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) provide to those Employees who immediately before
the Closing were employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries such
employee benefits and compensation opportunities (including salary, wages and
bonus and long-term incentive opportunities) that are the same or
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits and
compensation opportunities in effect for such Employees immediately before
the Closing (but excluding any change in control, severance, retention or
other pay or benefits with respect to a transaction occurring after the
Closing Date); _provided_ , that, the Compensation Committee of the board
of directors of Parent may, in its reasonable discretion, ( _i_ ) implement a
transition over at least two years to convert any incentive compensation
payment to any such Employee who is an underwriter so that the timing of such
payment is consistent with the timing of comparable incentive compensation
payments made to those Employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries who are
underwriters and ( _ii_ ) determine that any incentive compensation that would
have customarily been granted or paid by the Company in the form of equity
may be granted and paid by Parent in cash in lieu of equity.

(c) With respect to any Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries from and after the Closing
Date and before the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to provide,
severance benefits to such Employee which shall be determined and payable in
accordance with the severance benefit plan or agreement set forth on _Section
5.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter maintained by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for the benefit of such Employee immediately before the
Closing Date, in each case taking into account all service with the Company,
Parent and their respective Subsidiaries in determining the amount of
severance benefits payable.

 



64 (d) Parent and its Subsidiaries shall ensure that any Compensation and Benefit
Plan in which the Employees are eligible to participate after the Closing
Date shall take into account for purposes of eligibility and vesting
thereunder, except for purposes of qualifying for subsidized early retirement
benefits (other than under a Company Benefit Plan in effect immediately
before the Closing) or to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits, service by the Employees with the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries before the Closing Date, to the same extent such service
was credited before the Closing Date under a comparable Compensation and
Benefit Plan of the Company.

(e) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall honor all Company Benefit
Plans, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the
Closing Date; _provided_ that nothing herein shall limit the right of Parent
to amend or terminate any such plan in accordance with its terms.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall ( _i_ ) be construed
to establish or be treated as an amendment or modification of any
Compensation and Benefit Plan, ( _ii_ ) alter or limit Parents or any of its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries, following the
Closing) ability to amend, modify or interpret or terminate any Compensation
and Benefit Plan at any time in accordance with the terms of such plan and
applicable Law or ( _iii_ ) give any third party, including any Employee, any
right to rely upon or demand or enforce the provisions of this _Section
5.9_.

Section 5.10 _Listing; Reservation for Issuance_. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause all the following shares to be approved for
listing and quotation on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, no
later than the Closing Date: ( _a_ ) all Parent Common Shares to be issued in
the Merger to Company shareholders (including in respect of Company Restricted
Awards), and ( _b_ ) all Parent Common Shares to be reserved for issuance upon
exercise or vesting of the Company Converted Warrants, Company
Converted Options or Company Converted Restricted Awards (collectively, the "
_Listed Parent Common Shares_ "). Parent shall take all action necessary to
reserve for issuance, before the Closing Date, any Listed Parent Common Shares
that, by their terms and in accordance with this Agreement, will not be
issued until after the Effective Time.

Section 5.11  _Tax Treatment_. The parties intend the Merger to be treated
for United States federal income Tax purposes as a fully taxable purchase of
Company Common Shares by Parent and not qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and to file all U.S. Tax Returns
consistent with such treatment.

Section 5.12  _Notification_. The Company shall promptly notify Parent, and
Parent shall promptly notify the Company, of ( _a_ ) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions 

 



65  contemplated hereby or from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such
party to obtain such consent would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Company or Parent, as applicable, ( _b_ ) any matter
(including a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement) that would reasonably be expected to lead to the
failure to satisfy any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VI_ or
would trigger a right of termination under _Section 7.1_ and ( _c_ ) any
action, suit, claim, investigation or proceeding commenced or, to such partys
Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Failure to comply with this _Section 5.12_ shall not
result in the failure of any condition under _Article VI_ to be satisfied,
unless such condition would have otherwise been satisfied but for
such failure to comply with this _Section 5.12_.

Section 5.13 _Obligations of the Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause the Merger
Sub to perform all of its obligations in connection with this Agreement and
the Merger Agreement.

 

Section 5.14 _Book Value Calculations_.

(a) Within two Business Days following the date of its shareholder meeting
held under _Section 5.1_, unless this Agreement is earlier terminated under
_Section 7.1_ (or such other time as specified in _Section 7.2(e)(ii)_ or
Section 7.2(f) _(ii)_ ), a party (the " _Requesting Party_ "), may request, by
providing notice in writing delivered to the other party (the " _Non-
Requesting Party_ "), that the Non-Requesting Party prepare an estimate of
the Non-Requesting Partys Book Value as of the date that is one Business Days
before the Requesting Partys shareholder meeting (such date, the "
_Measurement Date_ ", and such estimate of book value, a " _Book Value
Estimate_ "). If a Requesting Party makes a request under this _Section
5.14(a)_, then the Non-Requesting Party shall promptly, and in any event
within five days, prepare a Book Value Estimate and provide such Book Value
Estimate, together with reasonable supporting analysis, to the Requesting
Party.

(b) The Requesting Party shall have five days from and after the time that the
Non-Requesting Party delivers its Book Value Estimate to the Requesting Party
to review the Non-Requesting Partys Book Value Estimate and supporting
analysis and such other information as the Requesting Party may reasonably
request in connection with its review of the Non-Requesting Partys Book Value
Estimate.

 

(c) (i) If the parties are unable to agree on the Non-Requesting Partys Book
Value within five days following the date that the Non-Requesting Party
delivers its Book Value Estimate, and the Requesting Party believes in good
faith that the items remaining in dispute would give (or in the case of
_Section 7.2(e)(ii)_ or Section 7.2(f) _(ii)_ , would have given) the
Requesting Party the right to terminate this Agreement under

 



66   _Section 7.1(h)_ or _Section 7.1(i)_ hereof, as applicable, then the
Requesting Party shall have the right to refer the determination of such Book
Value to an independent accounting firm reasonably acceptable to the Non-
Requesting Party (the " _Accounting Referee_ "). The parties shall use their
reasonable best efforts to engage the Accounting Referee within two Business
Days following the selection of the Accounting Referee.

(ii) If the Non-Requesting Partys Book Value Estimate is referred to the
Accounting Referee, each of Parent and the Company shall within three
Business Days following the date of such referral submit to the Accounting
Referee its final proposal (with copies thereof simultaneously delivered to
the other party) with respect to such disputed Book Value Estimate (which
final proposal shall specify any items as to which the parties have been able
to agree under _Section 5.14(b)_ and such partys proposal as to the items in
dispute). Parent and the Company shall reasonably cooperate and assist the
Accounting Referee in its review of the disputed items and the calculation of
Book Value, including giving reasonable access to all relevant information,
with due consideration being given to privilege issues and procedures for
resolving them. The Accounting Referee shall have the right, upon reasonable
notice, to request that the parties make an oral presentation to the
Accounting Referee regarding the items in dispute so long as each party shall
be afforded a full and equal opportunity to be heard but without unduly
prolonging the date by which the Accounting Referees determination shall be
made in accordance with _Section 5.14(d)_. None of the parties shall disclose
to the Accounting Referee, and the Accounting Referee shall not consider for
any purpose, any settlement discussions or settlement offer made by any of the
parties with respect to any dispute under this _Section 5.14(c)_, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties. 

(d) The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the
Accounting Referee to select, within five Business Days of the submission of
such final proposals in accordance with the first sentence of _Section
5.14(c)(ii)_, one of the two final proposals (with no compromise or split
decisions being allowed) as being the most representative of the Non-
Requesting Partys Book Value, and the proposal so selected shall be final and
binding between the parties. In making such determination, the Accounting
Referee shall consider only those items or amounts as to which the parties
have been unable to agree under _Section 5.14(b)_, and the proposal of the
party so selected by the Accounting Referee shall represent the resolution as
to all remaining items or amounts in their entirety. The fees and expenses of
the Accounting Referee shall be borne in their entirety by the party whose
final proposal is not selected by the Accounting Referee.

contributed to any such denial, order, judgment, decree, ruling or other
action;

(c) by either the Company or Parent, upon written notice to the other party,
if the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before October 1, 2013;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section

71  shall not be available to any party whose failure to comply in any material
respect with any provision of this Agreement primarily contributed to the
failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date;

(d) by either the Company or Parent, upon written notice to the other party,
if the board of directors (or any authorized and empowered committee thereof)
of the non-terminating party shall have ( _i_ ) effected a Recommendation

notice of such breach from the non-breaching party);

 

(e) by either the Company or Parent if the terminating party is not in
material breach of its obligations under this Agreement, upon written notice
to the other party, if there shall have been a breach by the other party (the
" _Breaching Party_ ") of any of the covenants or agreements or any of the
representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the part of the
Breaching Party, which breach would, individually or in the aggregate, result
in, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of the
conditions set forth in the case of ( _i_ ) the Company,  _Section 6.2(a)_
and _6.2(b)_ , and ( _ii_ ) Parent, _Section 6.3(a)_ and _6.3(b)_ , and which

effect to the Merger; _provided_ that the placing by A.M. Best Company, Inc.

from the date of such notice of termination and before the effectiveness of
such termination, the terminating party shall have made itself available to

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_.

 

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the

_Section 7.2_ (Effect of Termination), ( _v_ ) _Section 7.3_ (Matters
Relating to Termination), and ( _vi_ ) _Article VIII_ (General Provisions),
which shall survive such termination, except that no party shall be relieved
or released from any liabilities or damages (which the parties acknowledge and

costs, and may include to the extent proven the benefit of the bargain lost
by a partys shareholders (taking into consideration relevant matters,
including other combination opportunities, the time value of money and the
Consideration), which shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such
party) arising out of its willful and material breach of this Agreement
(including if this Agreement is terminated by either party under _Section
7.1(e)_) or fraud. For purposes of this Agreement, "willful and material
breach" shall mean a deliberate act or a deliberate failure to act, which act
or failure to act constitutes in and of itself a material breach of this
Agreement, regardless of whether such breach was the conscious object of the
act or failure to act.

 



73 (b) If the Company or Parent, as the case may be, terminates this Agreement
under  _Section 7.1(d)_, then the non-terminating party shall, as promptly
as reasonably practicable (and in any event not later than the next Business

transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to $94,500,000 (the
" _Termination Fee_ ").

(c) If either party terminates this Agreement under _Section 7.1(c)_, and (
_i_ ) from and after the date of this Agreement and at any time before October
1, 2013, a Takeover Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise
communicated to the officers of a party or its board of directors and ( _ii_
) such party enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or there is
consummated by such party, a transaction in connection with a Takeover
Proposal (whether or not the same as that originally announced or made known)
with any Person within nine months after such termination, then, on the
earlier of the date of such entering into a definitive agreement or
consummation, such party shall pay to the other party, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Termination Fee. For purposes of this
_Section 7.2(c)_, each reference to "10% or more" in the definition of
"Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "more than 50%."

(d) If either party terminates this Agreement under _Section 7.1(e)_ and (
_i_ ) from and after the date of this Agreement and at any time before the
termination, a Takeover Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise
communicated to the officers of the Breaching Party or its board of directors
and ( _ii_ ) the Breaching Party enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or there is consummated by the Breaching Party, a transaction in
connection with a Takeover Proposal (whether or not the same as that
originally announced or made known) with any Person within nine months after
such termination, then, on the earlier of the date of such entering into a
definitive agreement or consummation, the Breaching Party shall pay to the
other party, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Termination
Fee. For purposes of this _Section 7.2(d)_, each reference to "10% or more"
in the definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to
"more than 50%."

 

(e) ( _i_ ) If either party terminates this Agreement under _Section 7.1(f)_
because the Parent Share Issuance Vote was not obtained (and, if the Company
is the terminating party, the Company Merger Vote has not yet been taken or
has already been obtained), then Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within two Business Days following
such termination), pay to the Company, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount equal to 50% of the Termination Fee (the " _Parent
No Approval Fee_ "); provided, that, if ( _i_ ) from and after the date of
this Agreement and at any time before such vote a Takeover Proposal in
respect of Parent has been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the
officers of Parent or Parents

 



74  board of directors and ( _ii_ ) Parent enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to, or there is consummated by Parent, a transaction in
connection with a Takeover Proposal (whether or not the same as that
originally announced or made known) with any Person within nine months after
such termination, then, on the earlier of the date of such entering into a
definitive agreement or consummation, Parent shall pay to the Company,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Termination Fee less the

terminated by either party, Parent may request that the Company prepare a
Book Value Estimate pursuant to _Section 5.14_. In such case, the parties
shall comply with the provisions of _Section 5.14_, with Parent being the

then Parent shall not be obligated to pay the Parent No Approval Fee or
Termination Fee to the Company under _Section 7.2(e)(i)_. The parties

the Company Merger Vote was not obtained (and, if Parent is the terminating
party, the Parent Share Issuance Vote has not yet been taken or has already
been obtained), then the Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within two Business Days following such termination), pay
to Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to
50% of the Termination Fee (the " _Company No Approval Fee_ "); _provided_ ,
that, if ( _A_ ) from and after the date of this Agreement and at any time
before such vote a Takeover Proposal in respect of the Company has been
publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the officers of the Company or
the Companys board of directors and ( _B_ ) the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or there is consummated by the Company,
a transaction in connection with a Takeover Proposal (whether or not the same
as that

 



75  originally announced or made known) with any Person within nine months after
such termination, then, on the earlier of the date of such entering into a
definitive agreement or consummation, the Company shall pay to Parent, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Termination Fee less the
Company No Approval Fee (without taking into account any interest paid (or
payable) on the Company No Approval Fee pursuant to  _Section 7.3(d)_. For
purposes of this _Section 7.2(f)(i)_, each reference to "10% or more" in the
definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "more
than 50%."

 

(ii) The foregoing notwithstanding, if the Company Merger Vote was not
obtained (upon a vote taken thereon at the duly convened Company Shareholder
Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof at which such vote was
taken), and regardless of whether this Agreement has otherwise been terminated
by either party, the Company may request that Parent prepare a Book Value
Estimate pursuant to _Section 5.14_. In such case, the parties shall comply
with the provisions of _Section 5.14_, with the Company being the Requesting
Party and Parent being the Non-Requesting Party. If Parents Book Value as of
the Measurement Date is finally determined pursuant to _Section 5.14(d)_ to
be less than 80% of the Parent Book Value, then the Company shall not be
obligated to pay the Company No Approval Fee or Termination Fee to
Parent under _Section 7.2(f)(i)_. The parties further agree that while the
Book Value of Parent is being determined pursuant to _Section 5.14_ in
accordance with this _Section 7.2(f)(ii)_, neither the Company No Approval
Fee nor the Termination Fee shall be payable; _provided_ , that, if Parents
Book Value as of the Measurement Date is finally determined pursuant to
_Section 5.14(d)_ to be greater than or equal to 80% of the Parent Book
Value, then the Company shall pay interest on the Company No Approval Fee and
Termination Fee (if applicable) to Parent from the date of termination in
accordance with _Section 7.3(d)_.

(a) Except with respect to a termination under _Section 7.1(e)_ that arises
from the willful and material breach of this Agreement or fraud by the
Company, each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that if
Parent is entitled to receive and actually receives the Termination Fee under
this Agreement, Parents receipt of the Termination Fee shall constitute
Parents and Merger Subs sole and exclusive remedy for, and such amount
shall constitute liquidated damages in respect of, any termination of this
Agreement regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such termination.

(b) Except with respect to a termination under _Section 7.1(e)_ that arises
from the willful and material breach of this Agreement or fraud by Parent or
the Merger Sub, each of the Company and Parent acknowledges and agrees that

Fee under this Agreement, the Companys receipt of the Termination Fee shall
constitute the Companys sole and

respect of, any termination of this Agreement regardless of the circumstances
giving rise to such termination.

(c) Subject, for the avoidance of doubt, to the possible payment of the
Parent No Approval Fee or the Company No Approval Fee, as applicable, and the
remainder of the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.2(e)_ and _Section
7.2(f)_, as applicable, the parties agree and understand that in no event
shall either party be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

(d) The parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in
_Section 7.2_ and this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
parties would not enter into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable
under _Section 7.2_ do not constitute a penalty. If a party fails to pay as
directed in writing by the other party the Termination Fee and, if applicable,
the Parent No Approval Fee or the Company No Approval Fee, due to such party
under _Section 7.2_ within the time periods specified in _Section 7.2_, the
party owing the Termination Fee and, if applicable, the Parent No Approval Fee
or the Company No Approval Fee, shall pay the out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses of outside counsel)
incurred by the other party in connection with any action, including the
filing of any lawsuit, taken to collect payment of such amounts, together
with interest on such unpaid amounts at the prime lending rate prevailing

Section 8.3 _Interpretation_. The parties have participated jointly in
negotiating and drafting this Agreement. If an ambiguity or a question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
sections or subsections, such reference shall be to a section or subsection of
this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The phrases "the date of
this Agreement",

 



78 "the date hereof" and terms of similar import, will be deemed to refer to
December 18, 2012. The table of contents and headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "herein," "hereof,"
"hereunder" and words of similar import shall be deemed to refer to this
Agreement as a whole, including the Disclosure Letters and the Exhibits
hereto, and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Any pronoun
shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms.
References to "party" or "parties" in this Agreement mean the Company, the
Merger Sub and/or Parent, as the case may be. References to "dollars" or "$"
in this Agreement are to the lawful currency of the United States of America.
Time periods within or following which any payment is to be made or act is to
be done shall be calculated by excluding the day on which the period commences
and including the day on which the period ends and by extending the period to
the next Business Day following if the last day of the period is not a
Business Day. Each section or subsection of a Disclosure Letter qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation, warranty or covenant of the
Agreement; _provided_ that information disclosed in one section or subsection
of a Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be included in each other section or
subsection of such Disclosure Letter in which the relevance of such
information would be readily apparent on the face thereof. Representations
and warranties in _Article III_ that are made in reference to a partys
Disclosure Letter or "in the case of" or "with respect to" a certain party and
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates are being made only by that party.

Section 8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in separate
counterparts, each of which shall be considered one and the same agreement
and shall become effective when each of the parties has delivered a signed
counterpart to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need
not sign the same counterpart. Delivery of an executed signature page of this
Agreement by facsimile transmission or electronic ".pdf" shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.

Section 8.5 _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits, the Parent Disclosure Letter and
the Company Disclosure Letter) constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and shall terminate in accordance with its terms, or if the
Closing occurs, as set forth in _Section 5.2(b)_. 

(b) This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other
Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except ( _i_ ) as set forth in or
contemplated by the terms and provisions of _Section 5.7_, ( _ii_ ) that,
subject to _Section 7.3(b)_, the Company shall have the right to pursue
damages (including damages for their loss of economic benefits)

 



79  on behalf of the holders of Company Common Shares in the event of any
material breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub (which right is
hereby acknowledged by Parent and Merger Sub) and ( _iii_ ) from and after
the Effective Time, the rights of holders of Company Common Shares to receive
the Consideration set forth in _Article II_.

Section 8.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed with regard to, in all respects, including as to validity,
interpretation and effect, the Laws of Bermuda, without giving effect to its
principles or rules of conflict of laws.

Section 8.7 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability and,
unless the effect of such invalidity or unenforceability would prevent
the parties from realizing a material portion of the economic benefits of the
Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, shall not render
invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement
or affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement
is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be
only so broad as is enforceable.

Section 8.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations of the parties hereunder shall be assigned by any of
the parties (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other parties, which may be granted or withheld in the
sole discretion of the other parties. Any attempt to make any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

Section 8.9 _Enforcement_. The parties agree that money damages would be both
incalculable and an insufficient remedy and that irreparable damage would
occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that, subject to the discretion of the Chosen Courts, the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or violations of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Chosen Court, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Moreover, and in recognition of the foregoing, each of the parties hereby
waives ( _a_ ) any defense in any action for specific performance of this
Agreement that a remedy at law would be adequate and ( _b_ ) any requirement
under any law for any party to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining
equitable relief.

Section 8.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each party irrevocably and
unconditionally consents, agrees and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court of Bermuda (and appropriate appellate courts therefrom)
(the " _Chosen Courts_ "),

 



80  for the purposes of any litigation, action, suit or other proceeding with
respect to the subject matter hereof. Each party agrees to commence any
litigation, action, suit or proceeding relating hereto only in the Supreme
Court of Bermuda, or if such litigation, action, suit or other proceeding may
not be brought in such court for reasons of subject matter jurisdiction, in
the other appellate courts therefrom or other courts of Bermuda. Each party
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of
any litigation, action, suit or proceeding with respect to the subject matter
hereof in the Chosen Courts, and hereby further irrevocably and
unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each party further irrevocably and
unconditionally consents to and grants any such court jurisdiction over the
Person of such parties and, to the extent legally effective, over the subject
matter of any such dispute and agrees that mailing of process or other
documents in connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner
provided in _Section 8.2_ hereof or in such other manner as may be permitted
by applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient service thereof. The parties
agree that a final judgment in any such litigation, action, suit
or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

Section 8.11 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any
time before or after receipt of the Required Parent Vote or Required Company
Vote; _provided_ that after receipt of any such vote, no amendment shall be
made which by Law (or in the case of the Company, the rules and regulations of
the NASDAQ Global Select Market or in the case of Parent, the rules and
regulations of the NYSE) requires further approval by such shareholders
without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties by
their duly authorized representatives.

Section 8.12 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Effective Time, the
parties may, to the extent legally allowed, ( _i_ ) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, ( _ii_
) waive any breach of the representations or warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto or ( _iii_ ) waive compliance with any
of the covenants, agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on
the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of
a party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or
privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for
the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any
subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege
hereunder.

rights attaching to or the terms of issue of such shares, be deemed to be
altered by the creation or issue of further shares ranking pari passu
therewith. 
---|---|--- 



   5 | Shares 
---|--- 



     | 5.1 | Subject to the provisions of these Bye-Laws, the unissued
shares of the Company (whether forming part of the original capital or any
increased capital) shall be at the disposal of the Board, which may offer,
allot, grant options over or otherwise dispose of them to such persons, at
such times and for such consideration and upon such terms and conditions as
the Board may determine. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 5.2 | Subject to the provisions of these Bye-Laws, any shares of
the Company held by the Company as treasury shares shall be at the disposal of

of the shares. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5.3 | The Board may in connection with the issue of any shares
exercise all powers of paying commission and brokerage conferred or permitted
by law. 
---|---|--- 
  



C-7  or as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the Company as holding
any share upon trust and the Company shall not be bound by or required in any
way to recognise (even when having notice thereof) any equitable, contingent,
future or partial interest in any share or in any fractional part of a share
or (except only as otherwise provided in these Bye-Laws or by law) any other
right in respect of any share except an absolute right to the entirety thereof
in the registered holder. 
---|---|--- 



   6 | Certificates 
---|--- 



     | 6.1 | The Company shall be under no obligation to complete and
deliver a share certificate unless specifically called upon to do so by the
person to whom the shares have been issued. In the case of a share held
jointly by several persons, delivery of a certificate to one of several joint
holders shall be sufficient delivery to all. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 6.2 | If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may
be replaced without fee but on such terms (if any) as to evidence and
indemnity and to payment of the costs and out of pocket expenses of the
Company in investigating such evidence and preparing such indemnity as the
Board may think fit and, in case of defacement, on delivery of the old
certificate to the Company. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 6.3 | All certificates for share or loan capital or other
securities of the Company (other than letters of allotment, scrip certificates
and other like documents) shall, except to the extent that the terms and
conditions for the time being relating thereto otherwise provide, be issued
under the Seal or signed by a Director, the Secretary or any person authorised
by the Board for that purpose. The Board may by resolution determine, either
generally or in any particular case, that any signatures on any such
certificates need not be autographic but may be affixed to such certificates
by some mechanical means or may be printed thereon or that such certificates
need not be signed by any persons. 
---|---|--- 



   7 | Lien 
---|--- 



     | 7.1 | The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every
share (not being a fully paid share) for all monies, whether presently payable
or not, called or payable, at a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms
of issue of such share in respect of such share, and the Company shall also
have a first and paramount lien on every share (other than a fully paid share)
standing registered in the name of a Shareholder, whether singly or jointly
with any other person, for all the debts and liabilities of such Shareholder
or his estate to the Company, whether the same shall have been incurred before
or after notice to the Company of any interest of any person other than such
Shareholder, and whether the time for the payment or discharge of the same
shall have actually arrived or not, and notwithstanding that the same are
joint debts or liabilities of such Shareholder or his estate and any
other person, whether a Shareholder or not. The Companys lien on a share
shall extend to all dividends payable thereon. The Board may at any time,
either generally or in any particular case, waive any lien that has arisen or
declare any share to be wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of this
Bye-Law. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-8  think fit, any share on which the Company has a lien but no sale shall be made
unless some sum in respect of which the lien exists is presently payable nor
until the expiration of fourteen (14) days after a notice in writing, stating
and demanding payment of the sum presently payable and giving notice of the
intention to sell in default of such payment, has been served on the holder
for the time being of the share. 
---|---|--- 



     | 7.3 | The net proceeds of sale by the Company of any shares on
which it has a lien shall be applied in or towards payment or discharge of the
debt or liability in respect of which the lien exists so far as the same is
presently payable, and any residue shall (subject to a like lien for debts or
liabilities not presently payable as existed upon the share prior to the sale)
be paid to the person who was the holder of the share immediately before such
sale. For giving effect to any such sale, the Board may authorise some person
to transfer the share sold to the purchaser thereof. The purchaser shall be
registered as the holder of the share and he shall not be bound to see to the
application of the purchase money, nor shall his title to the share be
affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the
sale. 
---|---|--- 
 



   8 | Calls on Shares 
---|--- 



     | 8.1 | The Board may from time to time make calls upon the
Shareholders (for the avoidance of doubt excluding the Company in respect of
any nil or partly paid shares held by the Company as treasury shares) in
respect of any monies unpaid on their shares (whether on account of the par
value of the shares or by way of premium) and not by the terms of issue
thereof made payable at a date fixed by or in accordance with such terms of
issue, and each Shareholder shall (subject to the Company serving upon him at
least fourteen (14) days notice specifying the time or times and place of
payment) pay to the Company at the time or times and place so specified the
amount called on his shares. A call may be revoked or postponed as the Board
may determine. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8.2 | A call may be made payable by instalments and shall be
deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution of the Board
authorising the call was passed.  
---|---|--- 



     | 8.3 | The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally
liable to pay all calls in respect thereof. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 8.4 | If a sum called in respect of the share shall not be paid
before or on the day appointed for payment thereof the person from whom the
sum is due shall pay interest on the sum from the day appointed for the
payment thereof to the time of actual payment at such rate as the Board may
determine, but the Board shall be at liberty to waive payment of such interest
wholly or in part. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-9  payable on allotment or at any date fixed by or in accordance with such terms
of issue, whether on account of the nominal amount of the share or by way of
premium, shall for all the purposes of these Bye-Laws be deemed to be a call
duly made, notified and payable on the date on which, by the terms of issue,
the same becomes payable and, in case of non-payment, all the relevant
provisions of these Bye-Laws as to payment of interest, forfeiture or
otherwise shall apply as if such sum had become payable by virtue of a call
duly made and notified. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 8.6 | The Board may on the issue of shares differentiate between
the allottees or holders as to the amount of calls to be paid and the times of
payment.  
---|---|--- 



   9 | Forfeiture of Shares 
---|--- 



     | 9.1 | If a Shareholder fails to pay any call or instalment of a
call on the day appointed for payment thereof, the Board may at any time
thereafter during such time as any part of such call or instalment remains
unpaid serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or
instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 9.2 | The notice shall name a further day (not being less than
fourteen (14) days from the date of the notice) on or before which, and the
place where, the payment required by the notice is to be made and shall state
that, in the event of non-payment on or before the day and at the place
appointed, the shares in respect of which such call is made or instalment is
payable will be liable to be forfeited. The Board may accept the surrender of
any share liable to be forfeited hereunder and, in such case, references in
these Bye-Laws to forfeiture shall include surrender. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 9.3 | If the requirements of any such notice as aforesaid are not
complied with, any share in respect of which such notice has been given may at
any time thereafter, before payment of all calls or instalments and interest
due in respect thereof has been made, be forfeited by a resolution of the
Board to that effect. Such forfeiture shall include all dividends declared in
respect of the forfeited shares and not actually paid before the forfeiture. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.4 | When any share has been forfeited, notice of the forfeiture
shall be served upon the person who was before forfeiture the holder of the
share but no forfeiture shall be in any manner invalidated by any omission or
neglect to give such notice as aforesaid. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.5 | A forfeited share shall be deemed to be the property of the
Company and may be sold, re-offered or otherwise disposed of either to the
person who was, before forfeiture, the holder thereof or entitled thereto or
to any other person upon such terms and in such manner as the Board shall
think fit, and at any time before a sale, re-allotment or disposition the
forfeiture may be cancelled on such terms as the Board may think fit. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-10  thereupon cease to be a Shareholder in respect of the forfeited shares but
shall, notwithstanding the forfeiture, remain liable to pay to the Company
all monies which at the date of forfeiture were presently payable by him to
the Company in respect of the shares with interest thereon at such rate as the
Board may determine from the date of forfeiture until payment, and the
Company may enforce payment without being under any obligation to make any
allowance for the value of the shares forfeited. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9.7 | An affidavit in writing that the deponent is a Director of
the Company or the Secretary and that a share has been duly forfeited on the
date stated in the affidavit shall be conclusive evidence of the facts
therein stated as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the share.
The Company may receive the consideration (if any) given for the share on the
sale, re-allotment or disposition thereof and the Board may authorise some
person to transfer the share to the person to whom the same is sold, re-
allotted or disposed of, and he shall thereupon be registered as the holder of
the share and shall not be bound to see to the application of the purchase
money (if any) nor shall his title to the share be affected by any
irregularity or invalidity in the proceedings relating to the forfeiture,
sale, re-allotment or disposal of the share. 
---|---|--- 
 

REGISTER OF SHAREHOLDERS



   10 | Register of Shareholders 
---|--- 

The Secretary shall establish and maintain the Register at the Registered
Office in the manner prescribed by the Companies Acts. Unless the Board
otherwise determines, the Register shall be open to inspection in the manner
prescribed by the Companies Acts between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 noon on every
working day. Unless the Board so determines, no Shareholder or intending
Shareholder shall be entitled to have entered in the Register any indication
of any trust or any equitable, contingent, future or partial interest in any
share or any fractional part of a share and if any such entry exists or is
permitted by the Board it shall not be deemed to abrogate any of the
provisions of Bye-Law 5.4.

 

REGISTER OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS



   11 | Register of Directors and Officers 
---|--- 

The Secretary shall establish and maintain a register of the Directors and
Officers of the Company as required by the Companies Acts. The register of

C-11  TRANSFER OF SHARES

12 Transfer of Shares



     | 12.1 | Subject to the Companies Acts and to such of the
restrictions contained in these Bye-Laws as may be applicable, any Shareholder
may transfer all or any of his shares by an instrument of transfer in the
usual common form or in any other form which the Board may approve. No such
instrument shall be required on the redemption of a share or on the purchase
by the Company of a share. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 12.2 | The instrument of transfer of a share shall be signed by or
on behalf of the transferor and where any share is not fully-paid, the
transferee. The transferor shall be deemed to remain the holder of the share
until the name of the transferee is entered in the Register in respect
thereof. All instruments of transfer when registered may be retained by the
Company. The Board may, in its absolute discretion and without assigning any
reason therefor, decline to register any transfer of any share which is not a
fully-paid share. The Board may also decline to register any transfer unless: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 12.2.1 | the instrument of transfer is duly stamped (if required
by law) and lodged with the Company, accompanied by the certificate for the
shares to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Board may
reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer, 
---|---|--- 



     | 12.2.2 | the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one
class of share, and 
---|---|--- 



     | 12.2.3 | where applicable, the permission of the Bermuda Monetary
Authority with respect thereto has been obtained. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 12.3 | Subject to any directions of the Board from time to time in

within three (3) months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was
lodged, send to the transferee notice of such refusal. 
---|---|--- 



     | 12.5 | No fee shall be charged by the Company for registering any
transfer, probate, letters of administration, certificate of death or
marriage, power of attorney, stop notice, order of court or other instrument
relating to or affecting the title to any share, or otherwise making an entry
in the Register relating to any share. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-12  TRANSMISSION OF SHARES

13 Transmission of Shares



     | 13.1 | In the case of the death of a Shareholder, the survivor or
survivors, where the deceased was a joint holder, and the estate
representative, where he was sole holder, shall be the only person recognised
by the Company as having any title to his shares; but nothing herein contained
shall release the estate of a deceased holder (whether the sole or joint) from
any liability in respect of any share held by him solely or jointly with
other persons. For the purpose of this Bye-Law, estate representative means
the person to whom probate or letters of administration has or have been
granted in Bermuda or, failing any such person, such other person as
the Board may in its absolute discretion determine to be the person
recognised by the Company for the purpose of this Bye-Law. 
---|---|--- 



     | 13.2 | Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of
the death of a Shareholder or otherwise by operation of applicable law may,
subject as hereafter provided and upon such evidence being produced as may
from time to time be required by the Board as to his entitlement, either be
registered himself as the holder of the share or elect to have some person
nominated by him registered as the transferee thereof. If the person so
becoming entitled elects to be registered himself, he shall deliver or send to
the Company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects. If he
shall elect to have his nominee registered, he shall signify his election
by signing an instrument of transfer of such share in favour of his nominee.
All the limitations, restrictions and provisions of these Bye-Laws relating to
the right to transfer and the registration of transfer of shares shall be
applicable to any such notice or instrument of transfer as aforesaid as if
the death of the Shareholder or other event giving rise to the transmission
had not occurred and the notice or instrument of transfer was an instrument of
transfer signed by such Shareholder.  
---|---|--- 



     | 13.3 | A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the
death of a Shareholder or otherwise by operation of applicable law shall (upon
such evidence being produced as may from time to time be required by the
Board as to his entitlement) be entitled to receive and may give a discharge
for any dividends or other monies payable in respect of the share, but he
shall not be entitled in respect of the share to receive notices of or to
attend or vote at general meetings of the Company or, save as aforesaid, to
exercise in respect of the share any of the rights or privileges of a
Shareholder until he shall have become registered as the holder thereof.
The Board may at any time give notice requiring such person to elect either
to be registered himself or to transfer the share and, if the notice is not
complied with within sixty (60) days, the Board may thereafter withhold
payment of all dividends and other monies payable in respect of the shares
until the requirements of the notice have been complied with.

Board under this Bye-Law.

     | 14.2 | The Company may, by the Resolution increasing the capital,
direct that the new shares or any of them shall be offered in the first
instance either at par or at a premium or (subject to the provisions of the
Companies Acts) at a discount to all the holders for the time being of shares

15 Alteration of Capital



     | 15.1 | The Company may from time to time by Resolution:

privileges or conditions;  
---|---|--- 



     | 15.1.2 | consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital
into shares of larger par value than its existing shares; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 15.1.3 | sub-divide its shares or any of them into shares of
smaller par value than is fixed by its memorandum, so, however, that in the
sub-division the proportion between the amount paid and the amount, if any,
unpaid on each reduced share shall be the same as it was in the case of the
share from which the reduced share is derived; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 15.1.4 | make provision for the issue and allotment of shares
which do not carry any voting rights; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 15.1.5 | cancel shares which, at the date of the passing of the

     | 15.1.6 | change the currency denomination of its share capital. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-14  consolidation, or sub-division under this Bye-Law, the Board may settle the
same as it thinks expedient and, in particular, may arrange for the sale of
the shares representing fractions and the distribution of the net proceeds of
sale in due proportion amongst the Shareholders who would have been entitled
to the fractions, and for this purpose the Board may authorise some person to
transfer the shares representing fractions to the purchaser thereof, who shall
not be bound to see to the application of the purchase money nor shall his
title to the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in the
proceedings relating to the sale. 
---|---|--- 



     | 15.3 | Subject to the Companies Acts and to any confirmation or
consent required by law or these Bye-Laws, the Company may by Resolution from
time to time convert any preference shares into redeemable preference shares. 
---|---|--- 

16 Reduction of Capital

 



     | 16.1 | Subject to the Companies Acts, its memorandum and any

     | 16.2 | In relation to any such reduction, the Company may by
Resolution determine the terms upon which such reduction is to be effected

those shares to be affected.

GENERAL MEETINGS AND RESOLUTIONS IN WRITING 

17 General Meetings and Resolutions in Writing



     | 17.1 | Save and to the extent that the Company elects to dispense
with the holding of one or more of its Annual General Meetings in the manner
permitted by the Companies Acts, the Board shall convene and the Company
shall hold general meetings as Annual General Meetings in accordance with the
requirements of the Companies Acts at such times and places as the Board shall
appoint. The Board may, whenever it thinks fit, and shall, when required by
the Companies Acts, convene general meetings other than Annual General
Meetings which shall be called Special General Meetings. 
---|---|--- 



     | 17.2 | Except in the case of the removal of Auditors or Directors,
anything which may be done by resolution of the Shareholders in general
meeting or by resolution of any class of Shareholders in a separate general
meeting may be done by resolution in writing, signed by the Shareholders (or
the holders of such class of shares) who at the date of the notice of the
resolution in writing represent the majority of votes that would be required
if the resolution had been voted on at a meeting of the Shareholders. Such
resolution in writing may be signed by the Shareholder or its proxy, or in the
case of a Shareholder that is a corporation (whether or not a company within
the meaning of the Companies Acts) by its representative on behalf of such
Shareholder, in as many counterparts as may be necessary. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-15  this Bye-Law shall be given to all the Shareholders who would be entitled to
attend a meeting and vote on the resolution. The requirement to give notice
of any resolution in writing to be made under this Bye-Law to such
Shareholders shall be satisfied by giving to those Shareholders a copy of that
resolution in writing in the same manner as that required for a notice of a
general meeting of the Company at which the resolution could have been
considered, except that the length of the period of notice shall not apply.
The date of the notice shall be set out in the copy of the resolution in
writing.  
---|---|--- 



     | 17.4 | The accidental omission to give notice, in accordance with
this Bye-Law, of a resolution in writing to, or the non-receipt of such notice
by, any person entitled to receive such notice shall not invalidate the
passing of the resolution in writing. 
---|---|--- 



     | 17.5 | For the purposes of this Bye-Law, the date of the
resolution in writing is the date when the resolution in writing is signed by,
or on behalf of, the Shareholder who establishes the majority of votes
required for the passing of the resolution in writing and any reference in any
enactment to the date of passing of a resolution is, in relation to a
resolution in writing made in accordance with this Bye-Law, a reference to
such date. 
---|---|--- 



     | 17.6 | A resolution in writing made in accordance with this Bye-
Law is as valid as if it had been passed by the Company in general meeting or,
if applicable, by a meeting of the relevant class of Shareholders of the
Company, as the case may be. A resolution in writing made in accordance with
this Bye-Law shall constitute minutes for the purposes of the Companies Acts
and these Bye-Laws. 
---|---|---

     | 18.1 | An Annual General Meeting shall be called by not less than
five (5) days notice in writing and a Special General Meeting shall be called

day for which it is given, and shall specify the place, day and time of the
meeting, and, the nature of the business to be considered. Notice of every
general meeting shall be given in any manner permitted by these Bye-Laws to
all Shareholders other than such as, under the provisions of these Bye-Laws or
the terms of issue of the shares they hold, are not entitled to receive such
notice from the Company and every Director and to any Resident Representative
who or which has delivered a written notice upon the Registered Office
requiring that such notice be sent to him or it. 
---|---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding that a meeting of the Company is called by shorter notice than
that specified in this Bye-Law, it shall be deemed to have been duly called
if it is so agreed:

 



C-16  Meeting, by all the Shareholders entitled to attend and vote thereat; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 18.1.2 | in the case of any other meeting, by a majority in number

a majority together holding not less than ninety-five percent (95%) in
nominal value of the shares giving that right. 
---|---|--- 



     | 18.2 | The accidental omission to give notice of a meeting or (in
cases where instruments of proxy are sent out with the notice) the accidental
omission to send such instrument of proxy to, or the non-receipt of notice of
a meeting or such instrument of proxy by, any person entitled to receive such
notice shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 18.3 | The Board may cancel or postpone a meeting of the
Shareholders after it has been convened and notice of such cancellation or
postponement shall be served in accordance with these Bye-Laws upon all

new meeting in accordance with this Bye-Law.  
---|---|--- 

19 Proceedings at General Meetings



     | 19.1 | In accordance with the Companies Acts, a general meeting
may be held with only one individual present provided that the requirement for
a quorum is satisfied. No business shall be transacted at any general meeting
unless a quorum is present when the meeting proceeds to business, but the
absence of a quorum shall not preclude the appointment, choice or election of
a chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the
meeting. Save as otherwise provided by these Bye-Laws, at least one
Shareholder present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a
quorum for all purposes. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 19.2 | If within five (5) minutes (or such longer time as the
chairman of the meeting may determine to wait) after the time appointed for
the meeting, a quorum is not present, the meeting, if convened on the
requisition of Shareholders, shall be dissolved. In any other case, it shall
stand adjourned to such other day and such other time and place as the
chairman of the meeting may determine and at such adjourned meeting one
Shareholder present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a
quorum. The Company shall give not less than five (5) days notice of any
meeting adjourned through want of a quorum and such notice shall state that
the one Shareholder present in person or by proxy (whatever the number of
shares held by them) and entitled to vote shall be a quorum. 
---|---|--- 



     | 19.3 | A meeting of the Shareholders or any class thereof may be
held by means of such telephone, electronic or other communication facilities
(including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by telephone,
or by video conferencing) as permit all persons participating in the meeting
to communicate with each other simultaneously and instantaneously, and
participation in such a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such
meeting. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-17  in Bye-Law 18.1 above, the Resident Representative, if any, shall be entitled
to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. 
---|---|---

chairman at every general meeting. If there is no such chairman, or if at any
meeting the chairman is not present within five (5) minutes after the time
appointed for holding the meeting, or is not willing to act as chairman, the
Directors present shall choose one of their number to act or if only one
Director is present he shall preside as chairman if willing to act. If no
Director is present, or if each of the Directors present declines to take the
chair, the persons present and entitled to vote on a poll shall elect one of
their number to be chairman. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 19.6 | The chairman of the meeting may, with the consent by
resolution of any meeting at which a quorum is present (and shall if so
directed by the meeting), adjourn the meeting from time to time and from
place to place but no business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting
except business which might lawfully have been transacted at the meeting from
which the adjournment took place. When a meeting is adjourned for three (3)
months or more, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given as in the case
of an original meeting. Save as expressly provided by these Bye-Laws, it shall
not be necessary to give any notice of an adjournment or of the business to
be transacted at an adjourned meeting. 
---|---|--- 

20 Voting

 



     | 20.1 | Save where a greater majority is required by the Companies
Acts or these Bye-Laws, any question proposed for consideration at any general
meeting shall be decided on by a simple majority of votes cast. 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.2 | At any general meeting, a resolution put to the vote of the
meeting shall be decided on a show of hands or by a count of votes received in
the form of electronic records, unless (before or on the declaration of the
result of the show of hands or count of votes received as electronic records
or on the withdrawal of any other demand for a poll) a poll is demanded by: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 20.2.1 | the chairman of the meeting; or 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.2.2 | at least three (3) Shareholders present in person or
represented by proxy; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 20.2.3 | any Shareholder or Shareholders present in person or

less than one tenth (1/10) of the total sum paid up on all such shares
conferring such right. 
---|---|--- 

The demand for a poll may be withdrawn by the person or any of the persons
making it at any time prior to the declaration of the result. Unless a poll is
so demanded and the demand is not withdrawn, a declaration by the chairman
that a resolution has, on a show of hands or count of votes received as
electronic records, been carried or carried unanimously or by a particular
majority or not carried by a particular majority or lost shall be final and
conclusive, and an entry to that effect in the minute book of the Company
shall be conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or
proportion of votes recorded for or against such resolution.

 



     | 20.3 | If a poll is duly demanded, the result of the poll shall be
deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll is demanded. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 20.4 | A poll demanded on the election of a chairman, or on a
question of adjournment, shall be taken forthwith. A poll demanded on any
other question shall be taken in such manner and either forthwith or at such
time (being not later than three (3) months after the date of the demand) and
place as the chairman shall direct. It shall not be necessary (unless the
chairman otherwise directs) for notice to be given of a poll. 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.5 | The demand for a poll shall not prevent the continuance of
a meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which
the poll has been demanded and it may be withdrawn at any time before the
close of the meeting or the taking of the poll, whichever is the earlier. 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.6 | On a poll, votes may be cast either personally or by proxy. 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.7 | A person entitled to more than one vote on a poll need not
use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 20.8 | In the case of an equality of votes at a general meeting,
whether on a show of hands or count of votes received as electronic records or
on a poll, the chairman of such meeting shall not be entitled to a second or
casting vote and the resolution shall fail. 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.9 | In the case of joint holders of a share, the vote of the
senior who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall be accepted to
the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders, and for this purpose
seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the
Register in respect of the joint holding. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-19  statute or applicable law relating to mental health or in respect of whom an
order has been made by any Court having jurisdiction for the protection or
management of the affairs of persons incapable of managing their own affairs
may vote, whether on a show of hands or on a poll, by his receiver, committee,
_curator bonis_ or other person in the nature of a receiver, committee or
_curator bonis_ appointed by such Court and such receiver, committee, _curator
bonis_ or other person may vote on a poll by proxy, and may otherwise act and
be treated as such Shareholder for the purpose of general meetings. 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.11 | No Shareholder shall, unless the Board otherwise
determines, be entitled to vote at any general meeting unless all calls or
other sums presently payable by him in respect of shares in the Company have
been paid. 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.12 | If: 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.12.1 | any objection shall be raised to the qualification of
any voter; or, 
---|---|--- 



     | 20.12.2 | any votes have been counted which ought not to have been
counted or which might have been rejected; or, 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 20.12.3 | any votes are not counted which ought to have been
counted, 
---|---|--- 

the objection or error shall not vitiate the decision of the meeting or
adjourned meeting on any resolution unless the same is raised or pointed out
at the meeting or, as the case may be, the adjourned meeting at which the
vote objected to is given or tendered or at which the error occurs. Any
objection or error shall be referred to the chairman of the meeting and shall
only vitiate the decision of the meeting on any resolution if the
chairman decides that the same may have affected the decision of the meeting.
The decision of the chairman on such matters shall be final and conclusive.

to sign the same. 
---|---|--- 



     | 21.2 |

Any Shareholder may appoint a proxy or (if a corporation) representative for a
specific general meeting, and adjournments thereof, or may appoint a standing
proxy or (if a corporation) representative, by serving on the Company at the
Registered Office, or at such place or places as the Board may otherwise
specify for the purpose, a proxy or (if a corporation) an authorisation. Any
standing proxy or authorisation shall be valid for all general meetings and
adjournments thereof or resolutions in writing, as the case may be, until
notice of revocation is received at the Registered Office or at such place or
places as the Board may otherwise specify 

---|---|--- 
 



C-20  exists, its operation shall be deemed to have been suspended at any general
meeting or adjournment thereof at which the Shareholder is present or in
respect to which the Shareholder has specially appointed a proxy or
representative. The Board may from time to time require such evidence as it
shall deem necessary as to the due execution and continuing validity of any
standing proxy or authorisation and the operation of any such standing proxy
or authorisation shall be deemed to be suspended until such time as the Board
determines that it has received the requested evidence or other evidence
satisfactory to it.  
---|---

proxy which shall be irrevocable in accordance with its terms and the holder
thereof shall be the only person entitled to vote the relevant shares at any
meeting of the shareholders at which such holder is present. Notice of the
appointment of any such proxy shall be given to the Company at its Registered
Office, and shall include the name, address, telephone number and electronic
mail address of the proxy holder. The Company shall give to the proxy holder
notice of all meetings of Shareholders of the Company and shall be obliged to
recognise the holder of such proxy until such time as the holder notifies the
Company in writing that the proxy is no longer in force. 
---|---|--- 



     | 21.4 | Subject to Bye-Law 21.2 and 21.3, the instrument appointing
a proxy or corporate representative together with such other evidence as to
its due execution as the Board may from time to time require, shall be
delivered at the Registered Office (or at such place as may be specified in
the notice convening the meeting or in any notice of any adjournment or, in
either case or the case of a resolution in writing, in any document sent
therewith) prior to the holding of the relevant meeting or adjourned meeting
at which the person named in the instrument proposes to vote or, in the case
of a poll taken subsequently to the date of a meeting or adjourned
meeting, before the time appointed for the taking of the poll, or, in the
case of a resolution in writing, prior to the effective date of the resolution
in writing and in default the instrument of proxy or authorisation shall not
be treated as valid.  
---|---|--- 



     | 21.5 | Subject to Bye-Law 21.2 and 21.3, the decision of the
chairman of any general meeting as to the validity of any appointments of a
proxy shall be final.  
---|---|--- 



     | 21.6 | Instruments of proxy or authorisation shall be in any
common form or in such other form as the Board may approve and the Board may,
if it thinks fit, send out with the notice of any meeting or any resolution
in writing forms of instruments of proxy or authorisation for use at that

proxy shall be deemed to confer authority to demand or join in demanding a
poll, to speak at the meeting and to vote on any amendment of a resolution in
writing or amendment of a resolution put to the meeting for which it is given
as the proxy thinks fit. The instrument of proxy or authorisation
shall, unless the contrary is stated therein, be valid as well for any
adjournment of the meeting as for the meeting to which it relates. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-21  instrument of proxy or authorisation shall be valid notwithstanding the
previous death or unsoundness of mind of the principal, or revocation of the
instrument of proxy or of the corporate authority, provided that no intimation
in writing of such death, unsoundness of mind or revocation shall have been
received by the Company at the Registered Office (or such other place as may
be specified for the delivery of instruments of proxy or authorisation in the
notice convening the meeting or other documents sent therewith) at least one
hour before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting, or
the taking of the poll, or the day before the effective date of any
resolution in writing at which the instrument of proxy or authorisation is
used. 
---|---|--- 



     | 21.8 | Subject to the Companies Acts, the Board may at its
discretion waive any of the provisions of these Bye-Laws related to proxies or
authorisations and, in particular, may accept such verbal or other assurances
as it thinks fit as to the right of any person to attend, speak and vote on
behalf of any Shareholder at general meetings or to sign resolutions in
writing.

---|--- 



     | 34.1 | The Board may from time to time declare dividends or
distributions out of contributed surplus to be paid to the Shareholders
according to their rights and interests, including such interim dividends as
appear to the Board to be justified by the position of the Company. The Board,

Company to be issued to the Shareholders credited as fully paid or partly paid
or partly in one way and partly the other. The Board may also pay any fixed
cash dividend which is payable on any shares of the Company half yearly or on

---|---|--- 



     | 34.2 | Except insofar as the rights attaching to, or the terms of
issue of, any share otherwise provide: 
---|---|--- 
 



C-30  surplus may be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the

of this Bye-Law as paid-up on the share; 
---|---|--- 



     | 34.2.2  | dividends or distributions out of contributed surplus
may be apportioned and paid pro rata according to the amounts paid-up on the

addressed to the holder whose name stands first in the Register in respect of
the shares at his registered address as appearing in the Register or
addressed to such person at such address as the holder or joint holders may in
writing direct. Every such cheque or warrant shall, unless the holder or joint
holders otherwise direct, be made payable to the order of the holder or, in
the case of joint holders, to the order of the holder whose name stands first
in the Register in respect of such shares, and shall be sent at his or their
risk and payment of the cheque or warrant by the bank on which it is drawn
shall constitute a good discharge to the Company. Any one of two (2) or more

other monies payable or property distributable in respect of the shares held

The Board may also, in addition to its other powers, direct payment or
satisfaction of any dividend or distribution out of contributed surplus
wholly or in part by the distribution of specific assets, and in particular
of paid-up shares or debentures of any other company, and where any difficulty
arises in regard to such distribution or dividend, the Board may settle it as
it thinks expedient, and in particular, may authorise any person to sell and
transfer any fractions or may ignore fractions 

---|---|--- 
 



C-31  dividend purposes of any such specific assets and may determine that cash
payments shall be made to any Shareholders upon the footing of the values so
fixed in order to secure equality of distribution and may vest any such
specific assets in trustees as may seem expedient to the Board, provided that
such dividend or distribution may not be satisfied by the distribution of any
partly paid shares or debentures of any company without the sanction of a
Resolution. 
---|--- 



   35 | Reserves 
---|--- 

The Board may, before declaring any dividend or distribution out of
contributed surplus, set aside such sums as it thinks proper as reserves which
shall, at the discretion of the Board, be applicable for any purpose of the
Company and pending such application may, also at such discretion, either be
employed in the business of the Company or be invested in such investments as
the Board may from time to time think fit. The Board may also without placing
the same to reserve carry forward any sums which it may think it prudent not
to distribute.

CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS

 



   36 | Capitalisation of Profits 
---|--- 



     | 36.1 | The Board may from time to time resolve to capitalise all
or any part of any amount for the time being standing to the credit of any
reserve or fund which is available for distribution or to the credit of any
share premium account and accordingly that such amount be set free for
distribution amongst the Shareholders or any class of Shareholders who would
be entitled thereto if distributed by way of dividend and in the same
proportions, on the footing that the same be not paid in cash but be applied
either in or towards paying up amounts for the time being unpaid on any shares
in the Company held by such Shareholders respectively or in payment up in full
of unissued shares, debentures or other obligations of the Company, to be
allotted and distributed credited as fully paid amongst such Shareholders, or
partly in one way and partly in the other, provided that for the purpose of
this Bye-Law, a share premium account may be applied only in paying up of
unissued shares to be issued to such Shareholders credited as fully paid. 
---|---|--- 



     | 36.2 | Where any difficulty arises in regard to any distribution
under this Bye-Law, the Board may settle the same as it thinks expedient and,
in particular, may authorise any person to sell and transfer any fractions or
may resolve that the distribution should be as nearly as may be practicable in
the correct proportion but not exactly so or may ignore fractions altogether,
and may determine that cash payments should be made to any Shareholders in
order to adjust the rights of all parties, as may seem expedient to the Board.
The Board may appoint any person to sign on behalf of the persons entitled to
participate in the distribution any contract necessary or desirable for
giving effect thereto and such appointment shall be effective and binding upon
the Shareholders. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-32  RECORD DATES

 



   37 | Record Dates 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding any other provisions of these Bye-Laws, the Company may by
Resolution or the Board may fix any date as the record date for any dividend,
distribution, allotment or issue and for the purpose of identifying the

general meeting. Any such record date may be on or at any time before or after

at an office of the Company in Bermuda such records as will enable the
Directors to ascertain with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the

an Officer of the Company) shall have any right to inspect any accounting
record or book or document of the Company except as conferred by law
or authorised by the Board or by Resolution.

incurred in defending any legal proceedings whether civil or criminal and
expenses properly payable) incurred or suffered by him by or by reason of any
act done, conceived in or omitted in the conduct of the Companys business or
in the discharge of his duties and the indemnity contained in this Bye-Law
shall extend to any Indemnified Person acting in any office or trust in the
reasonable belief that he has been appointed or elected to such office or
trust notwithstanding any defect in such appointment or election PROVIDED
ALWAYS that the indemnity contained in this Bye-Law shall not extend to any
matter in respect of any fraud or dishonesty in relation to the Company which
may attach to any of the Indemnified Persons.

or right of action he or it may at any time have, whether individually or by

Person to take any action in the performance of his duties with or for the
Company PROVIDED HOWEVER that such waiver shall not apply to any claims or

portion of the advance attributable to any claim of fraud or dishonesty if
such a claim is proved against the Indemnified Person. 
---|---|--- 
 



C-36  advance is duly authorized upon a determination that the indemnification of
the Indemnified Person was appropriate because the Indemnified Person has met
the standard of conduct which entitles the Indemnified Person to
indemnification and further the determination referred to above must be made
by a majority vote of the Board at a meeting duly constituted by a quorum of
Directors not party to the proceedings in respect of which the indemnification
is, or would be, claimed; or, in the case such meeting cannot be constituted
by lack of disinterested quorum, by an independent third party; or,

expenses and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a Person.  
---|---|--- 



     | 42.8 | No amendment or repeal of any provision of this Bye-law 42
shall alter, to the detriment of any Person, the right of such Person to the

or failure to act which took place prior to such amendment, repeal or
termination.
