Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

The Parties (as defined below) desire to enter into this letter agreement
governed exclusively by the laws of the State of Delaware to provide for the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware over any legal
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this letter. This letter
confirms the intention of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Cyberonics_ "), Sorin S.p.A., a joint stock company organized under the laws
of Italy (" _Sorin_ "), Sand Holdco Limited, a private limited company
incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Sorin (" _Holdco_ "), and Cypher Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Sorin (" _Merger Sub_ ," and
together with Cyberonics, Sorin and Holdco, collectively, the " _Parties_ "
and each of them, individually, a " _Party_ ") to enter into an agreement (the
" _Transaction Agreement_ "), attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, providing for
the business combination transaction (the " _Proposed Transaction_ ")
contemplated therein. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the
respective meanings ascribed to them in the Transaction Agreement.

 



 

The Parties hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **1.** ** ****_Consultations with Works Council._**

 



 

(a) Promptly following the execution and delivery by the Parties of this
letter (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the
execution of this letter), Sorin shall commence such procedures to "inform and
consult with" the works council ( _comit e dentreprise_) of Sorin CRM SAS, a
French _soci ete par actions simplifiee _and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Sorin S.p.A. (the " _Works Council_ ") as may be required by applicable Law in
connection with the Proposed Transaction and shall exercise its best efforts
to obtain the Opinion (as defined below) from the Works Council in regards to
the Proposed Transaction as soon as possible following the date on which such
information and consultation process has been commenced. For purposes of this
letter, " _Opinion_ " means the opinion, whether positive or negative, of the
Works Council in respect of the Proposed Transaction, which may be rendered by
delivery of a written opinion by the

      
 

 



 

Works Council or by any other action which, under applicable Law, would cause
the Works Council to be deemed to have rendered such opinion.

 



 

(b) Sorin shall (i) permit Cyberonics to participate in any meetings with the
Works Council, (ii) keep Cyberonics regularly informed of the status of the
Works Council information and consultation process (including providing
Cyberonics with copies of any correspondence or other documentation received
by Sorin from the Works Council no later than 24 hours following the receipt
of any such correspondence or documents) and (iii) promptly provide Cyberonics
with a true and certified copy of the Opinion. Sorin shall (i) permit
Cyberonics to review in advance any written correspondence, notices or
communications (including any supporting materials) to be made by Sorin to the
Works Council, (ii) consult Cyberonics in connection with any such
communications and give Cyberonics a reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon, and take into account in good faith any comments that Cyberonics may
make with respect thereto and (iii) except as otherwise provided, and in
accordance with, the provisions of Section 5.04 of the Transaction Agreement,
support in all respects the Proposed Transaction throughout the information
and consultation process with the Works Council. Cyberonics shall promptly
furnish to Sorin such information as may be reasonably requested by Sorin in
connection with such consultation process or the preparation of any filing or
submission to the Works Council required in connection therewith. Sorin shall
not, and shall cause its Representatives not to, make any commitment to the
Works Council or any Governmental Authority or representative thereof in
connection with the information and consultation process, including with
respect to modifications to the terms of the Proposed Transaction or the
future business or operations of Holdco, Sorin or Cyberonics, in each case
without the prior written consent of Cyberonics.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this letter, " _Consultation Period_ " means the period
beginning on the date of this letter and ending on the earlier of (i) the date
one calendar month later and (ii) the date upon which the Opinion has been
rendered or deemed to have been rendered.

directing and empowering the Attorney-in-Fact to execute and deliver the
Transaction Agreement on such Partys behalf in accordance with Section 2(b).
NEITHER PARTY SHALL TAKE ANY ACTION OR ATTEMPT TO TAKE ANY ACTION TO REVOKE,
RESCIND, WITHDRAW, IMPAIR OR OTHERWISE LIMIT THE POWERS GRANTED TO THE
ATTORNEY-IN-FACT PURSUANT TO THE AGENT AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT AGREEMENT (ANY

delivery by Cyberonics) and Section 9.02 of the Agent and Attorney-in-Fact
Agreement, cause the Attorney-in-Fact to execute and deliver the Transaction
Agreement on behalf of all of the parties thereto; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that during the five-calendar-day period following the expiration of the
Consultation Period (such period, the " _Consideration Period_ "), the Parties
will give due consideration to any recommendations made by the Works Council
in the Opinion and will consider such changes to the Transaction Agreement as
the Parties may mutually agree to reflect such recommendations.
Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the right of each of Cyberonics and Sorin to cause the execution
and delivery of the Transaction Agreement on behalf of all of the parties
thereto is not subject to any condition other than the expiration of the
Consideration Period, and furthermore, that no Party is under any obligation
to agree to any change to the Transaction Agreement in order to address any

5. _Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) In the event of termination of this letter by either Cyberonics or Sorin
as provided in Section 4, this letter shall forthwith become void and have no
effect and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
Cyberonics, Sorin, Holdco or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, officers or directors, in each case, except with respect to
Section 5.13 of the Transaction Agreement as incorporated herein by reference;
_provided, however_ , that (a) subject to Section 5(d), nothing herein shall

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this letter
and the aggrieved party will be entitled to all rights and remedies available
at law or in equity and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive
termination in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) In the event that this letter is terminated:

 



 

(i) by Cyberonics pursuant to Section 4(a)(i)(A)(2) or Section 4(a)(i)(D),
then Sorin shall pay to Cyberonics or its designee, within two (2) Business
Days

 



      
 

 



 

following the date of such termination by Cyberonics, $ 75,000,000 (the "
_Business Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available funds;

 



 

(ii) by Sorin pursuant to Section 4(b)(i)(A)(2) or Section 4(b)(i)(D), then
Cyberonics shall pay to Sorin or its designee, within two (2) Business Days
following the date of such termination by Sorin, the Cyberonics Termination
Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds; and

 



 

(iii) by Cyberonics pursuant to Section 4(a)(i)(E), then Cyberonics shall pay
to Sorin or its designee prior to or concurrently with such termination, the
Cyberonics Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 



 

Sorin and Cyberonics acknowledge and agree that neither the Cyberonics
Termination Fee nor the Business Termination Fee is a penalty but rather is a
reasonable estimate of damages necessary to compensate Cyberonics or Sorin, as
the case may be, in the circumstances in which the Cyberonics Termination Fee
or Business Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable, including, in the
circumstances in which the Business Termination Fee is payable, damages
attributable to the loss of opportunities resulting from entry by Cyberonics
into and termination of this letter. Sorin and Cyberonics hereby acknowledge
and agree that the amount of the Cyberonics Termination Fee or Business
Termination Fee, if and as applicable, is fair, after taking into account the
value of the Sorin Merger and Cyberonics Merger, the other transactions
contemplated hereby and all the costs and expenses already incurred by the
Parties before entering into this letter. In no event shall Cyberonics, on the
one hand, or Sorin, on the other hand, be required to pay to the other party
more than one Cyberonics Termination Fee or Business Termination Fee, if and
as applicable, pursuant to this Section 5(b).

 



 

(c) In the event that this letter is terminated by Sorin pursuant to Section
4(b)(i)(B), then Cyberonics shall pay to Sorin, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Cyberonics Expense Reimbursement. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated by Cyberonics pursuant to Section
4(a)(i)(B), then Sorin shall pay to Cyberonics, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the Sorin Expense Reimbursement.

 



 

(d) The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that upon any termination of
this letter where either the Cyberonics Termination Fee or Business
Termination Fee becomes due and payable, the payment of the Cyberonics
Termination Fee or Business Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant to
Section 5(b) shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all
monetary damages of the party to which such Cyberonics Termination Fee or
Business Termination Fee, as applicable, is paid and its affiliates, and their
respective directors, officers and other Representatives, arising out of or
related to this letter or the Proposed Transaction, including as a result of
any breach of this letter, the termination of this letter, the failure to
consummate the Proposed Transaction, and any claims or actions under
applicable Law arising out of such breach, termination or failure.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Each of the Parties acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in this
Section 5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this letter
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into
this letter; accordingly, if a Party fails promptly to pay any amount due
pursuant to Section 5(b) or 5(c) and, in order to obtain such payment, another
Party commences a suit that results in a judgment against the first Party for
the payment set forth in Section 5(b) or 5(c) or any portion thereof, such
first Party shall pay to the other Party the other Partys costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount from the date such payment was
required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate as published
in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made.

 



 

6. _Confidentiality_. This letter and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

7. _General Provisions_.

 



 

(a) This letter may be amended by the Parties at any time prior to the
termination hereof. This letter may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by each of the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, this
Section 7(a) shall survive the termination hereof. At any time prior to the
termination of this letter, Sorin, Holdco and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and
Cyberonics, on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach of the
representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) to the extent permitted by Law,
waive compliance by the other with any of the covenants or conditions
contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. The failure of any Party to assert any of its rights under this
letter or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



 

(b) All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, faxed
(with confirmation), electronically mailed in portable document format (PDF)
(with confirmation) or sent by overnight courier (providing proof of delivery)

(c) If any term or other provision of this letter is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced
by any rule of Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this
letter shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal,
unenforceable or incapable of being enforced, the court or other tribunal
making such determination is authorized and instructed to modify this letter
so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible so
that the transactions and agreements contemplated herein are consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

(d) This letter (including those provisions of the Transaction Agreement
incorporated herein by reference) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute
the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with
respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights
or remedies hereunder.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Neither this letter nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this letter shall be assigned or transferred, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties. Any assignment or transfer in violation of the
preceding sentence shall be void.

 



 

(f) This letter shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
Party and its successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this letter,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
letter. The representations and warranties referenced in this letter are the
product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the
Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject
to waiver by the Parties in accordance with Section 7(a) without notice or
liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and
warranties referenced in this letter may represent an allocation among the
Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the Parties. Consequently, persons other than the Parties
may not rely upon such representations and warranties as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this letter or as of any other
date. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 7(f) shall survive the
termination of the letter.

 



 

(g) Each Party has participated in the drafting of this letter (including
those provisions of the Transaction Agreement incorporated herein by
reference), which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this letter (including those provisions of the
Transaction Agreement incorporated herein by reference) shall be construed as
if drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this letter (including those provisions of the
Transaction Agreement incorporated herein by reference), whenever the context
requires the singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa. As used
in this letter (including those provisions of the Transaction Agreement
incorporated herein by reference), the words "include" and "including," and
words of similar meaning, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but
rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."
Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this letter to "Sections" are
intended to refer to Sections of this letter. Unless otherwise specifically
provided for herein, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. The
words "hereof," "herein," "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used
in this letter, refer to this letter as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this letter. The headings contained in this letter are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this letter.

(i) This letter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the

7(h)(i) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, have the
same legal force and effect as if served upon such Party personally within the
State of Delaware. For purposes of implementing the Parties agreement to
appoint and maintain an agent for service of process in the State of Delaware,
each such Party that has not as of the date hereof already duly appointed such
an agent does hereby appoint RLandF Service Corp., One Rodney Square, Tenth
Floor, Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware 19801, as such agent. Each of
the Parties agrees not to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating
thereto except in the courts described above in Delaware, other than actions

award rendered by any such court as described herein. Each of the Parties
further agrees that notice as provided herein shall constitute sufficient
service of process and the Parties further waive any argument that such

Delaware as described herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior

or otherwise) and (c) that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any such
court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action
or proceeding

 



      
 

 



 

is improper or (iii) this letter, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts.

 



 

(ii) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE

WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS LETTER,
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS LETTER. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY

THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO EXECUTE

(i) This letter may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the
different Parties in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall
be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute
one and the same agreement. The exchange of a fully executed letter (in
counterparts or otherwise) by facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf

this letter.

 



 

(j)

 



 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any Party does not perform the provisions of this letter in accordance with
its terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, subject to Section
7(j)(iii), the Parties acknowledge and agree that Sorin, Cyberonics and the
Attorney-in-Fact shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
letter and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being
in addition subject to Section 5(d) and Section 7(j)(iii), to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

 



 

(ii) Subject to Section 7(j)(iii), each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief as provided herein on the basis that (A) it has an adequate remedy at
Law or (B) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at Law or equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this letter and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this

 



      
 

 



 

letter shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

(iii) In no event shall Cyberonicss or Sorins right to seek specific
performance pursuant to this Section 7(j) reduce, restrict or otherwise limit
any right of such Party to terminate this letter and to be paid the Cyberonics
Termination Fee or Business Termination Fee, as and if applicable; provided
that in no event shall Cyberonics or Sorin be entitled to both specific
performance pursuant to this Section 7(j) and payment of the Business
Termination Fee or the Cyberonics Termination Fee, as applicable.

into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, share split (including a reverse share split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or
other similar transaction (but not including the Excluded Sorin Rescission
Shares), or a share dividend or share distribution thereon shall be declared

select, and Holdco shall enter into an agreement (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Cyberonics and Sorin) with, a financial

the Sorin Exchange Agent shall determine suitable procedures for the treatment
of fractional Holdco Shares that would have been issued in respect of Sorin
Shares in the Sorin Merger but for _Section 2.04(c)_, which procedures shall
be (i) in accordance with market practice in Italy and with the rules and
practice of Monte Titoli and (ii) reasonably acceptable to Cyberonics and

not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section
2.02_, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement. Holdco shall enter
into an agreement with the Cyberonics Exchange Agent in a form reasonably
acceptable to Cyberonics and Sorin. Any or all of the obligations of Holdco
contained in this _Section 2.05_ may be performed, satisfied or fulfilled by
one or more Sorin Subsidiaries or New Entities reasonably acceptable to
Cyberonics; provided that Holdco shall not be relieved of its obligations
under this _Section 2.05_ to the extent not performed, satisfied or fulfilled
in full by such Sorin Subsidiaries or New Entities.

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender._

 



 

(i) _Cyberonics Certificates. _Promptly after the Cyberonics Merger Effective
Time (and in any event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), Holdco
shall cause the Cyberonics Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
a Cyberonics Certificate, (a) a letter of transmittal (which shall notify
holders of the effectiveness of the Cyberonics Merger and specify that
delivery shall be effected, and that risk of loss and title to the Cyberonics

Cyberonics Exchange Agent), and (b) instructions for effecting the surrender
of the Cyberonics Certificates (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.05(f)_) to the Cyberonics Exchange Agent in exchange
for delivery of the Cyberonics Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender
of Cyberonics Certificates (or an affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.05(f)_) for cancellation to the Cyberonics Exchange
Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with such instructions, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Cyberonics Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Cyberonics Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor: (1)
certificates (or, at Holdcos option, uncertificated shares) representing the
Holdco Shares into which the Cyberonics Shares represented by such holders
Cyberonics Certificates were converted pursuant to _Section 2.02_, and the
Cyberonics Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled, and (2) a
check in United States dollars equal to the amount of any cash dividends or
other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
_Section 2.05(c)_, in each case, after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in _Section 2.09_ and without interest thereon.

 



 

(ii) _Cyberonics Book-Entry Shares_. Promptly after the Cyberonics Merger
Effective Time, Holdco shall cause the Cyberonics Exchange Agent to (a) mail

holder of the effectiveness of the Cyberonics Merger and the conversion of
their Cyberonics Shares into the right to receive the Cyberonics Merger
Consideration and (b) deliver (1) in registered form to each holder of
Cyberonics Book-Entry Shares that number of Holdco Shares that such holder is
entitled to receive in respect of each such Cyberonics Book-Entry Share
pursuant to _Section 2.02_ and (2) a check in United States dollars equal to
the amount of any cash dividends or other distributions that such holder has
the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.05(c)_, in each case, after

and without interest thereon.

 



 

(c) _Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Cyberonics
Shares._ All Holdco Shares to be issued pursuant to the Cyberonics Merger
shall be issued and outstanding as of the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time and
whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by Holdco in respect of
the Holdco Shares, the record date for which is after the Cyberonics Merger
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other
distributions in respect of all Holdco Shares issued in the Cyberonics Merger.
Subject to _Section 2.05(e)_, the Cyberonics Exchange Agent shall hold any
Holdco Shares in respect of any unsurrendered Cyberonics Certificate in trust
for the holder of such Cyberonics Certificate until such Cyberonics
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
2.05(f)_) has been surrendered for exchange in accordance with this _Article
II_. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Holdco Shares shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Cyberonics Certificate until such
Cyberonics Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
_Section 2.05(f)_) has been surrendered for exchange in accordance with this
_Article II_. Subject to applicable Law and the provisions of this _Article
II_, following surrender of any such Cyberonics Certificate (or affidavit of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 2.05(f)_), there shall be
delivered to the record holder of the certificate representing shares of
Holdco Shares issued in exchange therefor, without interest and after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.09_, (i) at
the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time with respect to such Holdco
Shares and not theretofore paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Holdco Shares

Cyberonics Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Cyberonics shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Cyberonics Merger Surviving Corporation of the
Cyberonics Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Cyberonics
Merger Effective Time. The Cyberonics Merger Consideration issued in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_, together with any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.05(c)_, shall represent
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Cyberonics Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time. From
and after the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time, the holders of Cyberonics
Shares outstanding immediately prior thereto shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable
Law.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. _At any
time following the first anniversary of the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time
(or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the amounts would

shall be entitled to require the Cyberonics Exchange Agent to deliver to it
all or any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest or investment
income received with respect thereto) not transferred to holders of Cyberonics
Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Holdco
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general
creditors thereof with respect to the Cyberonics Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Cyberonics Certificates and compliance with the
procedures set forth in _Section 2.05(b)_, without interest. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the Cyberonics Merger Surviving Corporation, the Sorin
Merger Surviving Company, Holdco, the Cyberonics Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of Cyberonics Shares or Sorin
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(f) _Transferred Certificates; Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. _In the
event any Cyberonics Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such
Cyberonics Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and compliance with the
replacement requirements established by the Cyberonics Exchange Agent
including the posting by such person of a bond in customary amount and upon
such terms as may be required by Holdco or the Cyberonics Exchange Agent as
indemnity against any claim with respect to such Cyberonics Certificate that
may be made against Holdco, the Cyberonics Merger Surviving Corporation or the
Cyberonics Exchange Agent, such person (or its designee) shall be entitled to
receive, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Cyberonics
Certificate, the Cyberonics Merger Consideration, plus any dividends and other
distributions in respect of the Holdco Shares that would have been delivered
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.09_) had such lost,
stolen or destroyed Cyberonics Certificate been surrendered. If delivery of
the Cyberonics Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Cyberonics Certificate is registered, it
shall be a condition of delivery that the Cyberonics Certificate so
surrendered be properly endorsed or be otherwise in proper form for transfer
and that the person requesting such delivery shall have paid to the Cyberonics
Exchange Agent any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the delivery
of the Cyberonics Merger Consideration to a person other than the record
holder of the Cyberonics Certificate surrendered or shall have established to
the satisfaction of Holdco that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

 



 

 **SECTION 2.06 **_Treatment of Cyberonics Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Cyberonics Options._

 



 

(i) As of the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time, (A) each option to purchase
Cyberonics Shares granted under a Cyberonics Stock Plan (the " _Cyberonics
Options_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Cyberonics

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Effective Time shall be fully vested and (B) each Cyberonics Option
shall be cancelled and cease to represent an option to purchase Cyberonics
Shares and shall be converted into an option to purchase a number of Holdco
Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number)
obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Cyberonics Shares subject to such
Cyberonics Option immediately prior to the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time by
(ii) the Cyberonics Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share equal to
the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by dividing (A)
the per share exercise price specified in such Cyberonics Option immediately
prior to the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time _by_ (B) the Cyberonics Exchange
Ratio; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and the number of
shares of Holdco Shares purchasable pursuant to such Cyberonics Option will be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the
Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of any Cyberonics Option to
which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of
shares of Holdco Shares purchasable pursuant to such Cyberonics Option shall
be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as
are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the Cyberonics Merger
Effective Time, each Cyberonics Option shall continue to be governed by the
same terms and conditions (including exercisability terms) as were applicable
to such Cyberonics Option immediately prior to the Cyberonics Merger Effective
Time.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section 2.06(a)(i) _or anything else to the contrary,
with respect to any Cyberonics Options that were granted prior to January 1,
2013 and are held by a Section 16 Person, each such Cyberonics Option that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time (whether
vested or unvested) shall, as of the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time, be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of such Cyberonics Option to
receive (without interest), on the date on which the Cyberonics Merger
Effective Time occurs, an amount in cash equal to the product (rounded down to
the nearest cent) obtained by multiplying (i) the number of Cyberonics Shares
subject to such Cyberonics Option immediately prior to the Cyberonics Merger
Effective Time by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Cyberonics Trading Price
over (B) the per share exercise price specified in such Cyberonics Option
immediately prior to the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time, less applicable
Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment. For the avoidance
of doubt, any Cyberonics Option which has a per share exercise price that is
greater than or equal to the Cyberonics Trading Price shall be cancelled at
the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time for no consideration or payment.

 



 

(iii) " _Cyberonics Trading Price_ " means the average of the volume-weighted
average prices, rounded to four decimal points, of Cyberonics Shares on NASDAQ
for ten individual (10) trading days within the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on (and including) the second full trading day prior to
the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time (with such ten (10) trading days to be
selected by random lottery in the presence of senior executives of each of
Sorin and

 



      
 

 



 

Cyberonics), in each case as reported by Bloomberg Financial Markets, or any
successor thereto, through its "Volume Weighted Average Price" function (or,
if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by
Sorin and Cyberonics), subject to appropriate adjustments for any stock
dividend, stock split or other similar transactions that occur during such
period. If the volume-weighted average price cannot be calculated for
Cyberonics Shares on any such date, the volume-weighted average price for such
date shall be the fair market value as mutually agreed upon by Sorin and
Cyberonics.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Cyberonics Shares._ Each outstanding Cyberonics
Share subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to the
Cyberonics Stock Plans immediately prior to the Cyberonics Merger Effective
Time (each, a " _Restricted Cyberonics Share_ ") shall, as of the Cyberonics
Merger Effective Time, accelerate and become fully vested (with performance-
based Restricted Cyberonics Shares vesting at 100% of the target level) and
shall be converted into, and become exchanged for the Cyberonics Merger
Consideration (less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such vesting) in accordance with _Section 2.02_. Except as otherwise agreed
to by Cyberonics and Sorin, with respect to each Section 16 Person who is an
officer of Cyberonics (other than the individual whose name is set forth on
_Section 2.06_ of the Cyberonics Disclosure Letter), 50% of the Holdco Shares
payable to such Section 16 Person pursuant to this _Section 2.06(b) _shall be
subject to an 18-month lock-up period, which will terminate on termination of
employment of the holder for any reason, and the remaining 50% of the Holdco
Shares payable to such Section 16 Person pursuant to this _Section 2.06(b)
_shall not be subject to any lock-up period.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Cyberonics RSUs_. As of the Cyberonics Merger Effective
Time, (A) any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding restricted
stock unit pursuant to the Cyberonics Stock Plans immediately prior to the

accelerate (with performance-based Cyberonics RSUs vesting at 100% of the
target level), and (B) each Cyberonics RSU shall be cancelled and shall only
entitle the holder of such Cyberonics RSU to receive (without interest), as
promptly as practicable after the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time (but in any
event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Cyberonics Merger
Effective Time), a number of Holdco Shares equal to the product (rounded down
to the nearest whole number) obtained by multiplying (i) the number of
Cyberonics Shares subject to such Cyberonics RSU immediately prior to the
Cyberonics Merger Effective Time by (ii) the Cyberonics Exchange Ratio (less
applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to such payment);
_provided_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary, with respect to
any Cyberonics RSU held by a Section 16 Person, the amount determined in
accordance with this _Section 2.06(c) _will be paid to such Section 16 Person
on the date on which the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time occurs; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that with respect to any Cyberonics RSUs that constitute
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code and
that are not permitted to be paid at the Cyberonics Merger Effective Time
without triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, such
payment shall be made at the earliest time permitted under the applicable
Cyberonics Stock Plan and award agreement that will not trigger a Tax or
penalty under Section 409A of the Code. Except as otherwise agreed to by

 



      
 

 



 

Cyberonics and Sorin, with respect to each Section 16 Person who is an officer
of Cyberonics (other than the individual whose name is set forth on _Section
2.06_ of the Cyberonics Disclosure Letter), 50% of the Holdco Shares payable
to such Section 16 Person pursuant to this _Section 2.06(c) _shall be subject
to an 18-month lock-up period, which will terminate on termination of
employment of the holder for any reason, and the remaining 50% of the Holdco
Shares payable to such Section 16 Person pursuant to this _Section 2.06(c)
_shall not be subject to any lock-up period.

following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Cyberonics
Merger Effective Time, Cyberonics shall take all actions, including obtaining
any necessary determinations and/or resolutions of Cyberonicss board of
directors or a committee thereof and, if appropriate, amending the terms of
Cyberonicss 1991 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") that may be
necessary or required under the ESPP and applicable Laws to ensure that (A)
except for the six (6) month offering period under the ESPP that commenced on
December 1, 2014 (the " _Final Offering_ "), no offering period shall be

occur prior to the end of the Final Offering as scheduled as of immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement, (i) each individual participating in the

(f) _Holdco Actions_. Holdco shall take all action necessary for the

Cyberonics Stock Plans remain in effect and such registration of interests
therein or the Holdco Shares issuable thereunder continues to be required.

 



 

 **SECTION 2.07 **_Treatment of Sorin Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Assumption of Sorin Stock Plans. _As of the Sorin Merger Effective Time,
Holdco shall assume, or shall cause one of its Subsidiaries to assume, all
Sorin Stock Plans and the Sorin Options granted thereunder in accordance with
this _Section 2.07_ and Holdco shall be able to grant stock awards, to the
extent permissible by applicable Laws, the Listing Rules and NASDAQ
regulations, under the terms of the Sorin Stock Plans covering the reserved
but unissued Sorin Shares, except that (i) Sorin Shares covered by such awards
will be Holdco Shares and (ii) all references to a number of Sorin Shares will
be changed to references to Holdco Shares. Prior to the Sorin Merger Effective
Time, Sorin and Holdco shall adopt such resolutions and take such other
actions as may be reasonably required to effectuate the foregoing provisions
of this _Section 2.07(a)_, subject to any adjustments that may be required by
the Laws of England and Wales or Italy.

 



 

(b) _Sorin Options. _As of the Sorin Merger Effective Time, (i) each option or
stock appreciation right to acquire Sorin Shares or to receive a cash payment
based on the value thereof granted under any Sorin Stock Plan (each, a "
_Sorin Option_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Sorin Merger
Effective Time shall be fully vested and (ii) each Sorin Option shall be
cancelled and cease to represent an option or stock appreciation right based
on Sorin Shares and shall be converted into an option or stock appreciation
right based on that number of Holdco Shares equal to the product (rounded down
to the nearest whole number) obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Sorin
Shares subject to such Sorin Option immediately prior to the Sorin Merger
Effective Time by (B) the Sorin Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) obtained by
dividing (x) the per share exercise price specified in such Sorin Option
immediately prior to the Sorin Merger Effective Time by (y) the Sorin Exchange
Ratio (which exercise price may be converted into dollars or pounds based on
the applicable currency exchange rates); _provided_ , _however_ , in the case
of any Sorin Option to which Section 409A of the Code applies, that the
exercise price and the number of shares of Holdco Shares purchasable pursuant
to such Sorin Option will be determined in a manner consistent with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the
case of any Sorin Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the
exercise price and the number of shares of Holdco Shares purchasable pursuant
to such Sorin Option shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing,
subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the
requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided
above,

 



      
 

 



 

following the Sorin Merger Effective Time, each Sorin Option shall continue to
be governed by the same terms and conditions (including exercisability terms)
as were applicable to such Sorin Option immediately prior to the Sorin Merger
Effective Time (but taking into account any changes thereto provided for in
the applicable Sorin Stock Plan or in any applicable award agreement and any
restrictions on replicating such terms and conditions under the Laws of
England and Wales or Italy).

 



 

(c) _Sorin RSUs and Sorin Performance Shares. _As of the Sorin Merger
Effective Time, (i) any vesting conditions applicable to each outstanding
restricted stock unit pursuant to the Sorin Stock Plans other than the
2012-2014 Long Term Incentive Plan of Sorin immediately prior to the Sorin
Merger Effective Time (each, a " _Sorin RSU_ ") and each outstanding
performance share pursuant to the Sorin Stock Plans other than the 2012-2014
Long Term Incentive Plan of Sorin immediately prior to Sorin Merger Effective
Time (each, a " _Sorin Performance Share_ " and each award of Sorin RSUs or
Sorin Performance Shares, a " _Sorin LTI Award_ ") shall accelerate at 100% of
the target level and (ii) each Sorin LTI Award shall be cancelled and shall
only entitle the holder of such Sorin LTI Award to receive (without interest),
at the times set forth in the remainder of this _Section 2.07(c)_, a number
of Holdco Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Sorin Shares subject to such
Sorin LTI Award immediately prior to the Sorin Merger Effective Time by (B)
the Sorin Exchange Ratio. Except as otherwise agreed by Cyberonics and Sorin,
with respect to each Sorin LTI Award, the terms of which currently provide for
a lock-up period and, except as otherwise determined by Sorin, each other
Sorin LTI Award (collectively, the " _Modified Sorin LTI Awards_ "), a portion
of the Holdco Shares payable pursuant to this Section 2.07(c) shall be paid as
promptly as practicable after the Sorin Merger Effective Time (but in any
event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Sorin Merger Effective
Time), with such portion equal to the number of Holdco Shares that would have
been payable with respect to such award based on (x) the actual level of
performance achieved for the 2012-2014 performance period (which is expected
to be 30.57%) and (y) the portion of the applicable performance period
completed as of the Sorin Merger Effective Time. Of the remaining Holdco
Shares payable pursuant to each such Modified Sorin LTI Award, 50% shall be
paid on the first anniversary of the date hereof and 50% shall be paid on the
second anniversary of the date hereof, in each case subject to the continued
employment with Sorin or Holdco or any of their respective affiliates of the
holder of such Modified Sorin LTI Award through the applicable payment date;
provided that any holder of a Modified Sorin LTI Award whose employment is
terminated in a "good leaver" or similar termination shall remain entitled to
receive such Holdco Shares promptly following such termination. The Holdco
Shares payable with respect to each Sorin LTI Award other than the Modified
Sorin LTI Awards shall be paid as promptly as practicable after the Sorin
Merger Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days

" _Sorin Deferred Bonus Share_ ") shall accelerate and (ii) each Sorin
Deferred Bonus Share shall be cancelled and shall only entitle the holder of
such Sorin Deferred Bonus Share to receive (without interest), as promptly as
practicable after the Sorin Merger Effective Time (but in any event no later
than three (3) Business Days after the Sorin Merger Effective Time), a number
of Holdco Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest whole
number) obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Sorin Shares subject to such
Sorin Deferred Bonus Share immediately prior to the Sorin Merger Effective
Time by (B) the Sorin Exchange Ratio. No Holdco Shares payable with respect to
any Sorin Deferred Bonus Share shall be subject to any lock-up period.

 



 

(e) _2012-2014 Sorin Performance Shares. _Each individual who, as of the date
of this Agreement, holds any performance shares under the 2012-2014 Long Term
Incentive Plan of Sorin (" _2012-2014 Participant"_ ) shall be entitled to
receive (without interest), as promptly as practicable after the Sorin Merger
Effective Time (but in any event no later than three (3) Business Days after
Sorin Merger Effective Time), a number of Holdco Shares equal to the product
(rounded down to the nearest whole number) obtained by multiplying (i) 69.43%
of the number of Sorin Shares that would have been payable to such individual
with respect to such performance shares pursuant to the terms of such
2012-2014 Long Term Incentive Plan if the respective target levels of
performance had been achieved at 100% with respect to such awards by (ii) the
Sorin Exchange Ratio. Unless otherwise agreed by Cyberonics and Sorin, with
respect to each 2012-2014 Participant who holds performance shares under the
2012-2014 Long Term Incentive Plan the terms of which provide that the Sorin
Shares payable with respect to such performance shares would be subject to a
lock-up period following settlement, and, except as otherwise determined by
Sorin, each other performance share under the 2012-2014 Long Term Incentive
Plan (collectively, the " _Modified 2012-2014 LTI Awards_ "), 50% of the
Holdco Shares payable to such individual pursuant to this _Section 2.07(e)
_shall be subject to an 18-month lock-up period (on the same terms otherwise
applicable and which shall terminate upon termination of employment of the
holder), and 50% of such Holdco Shares shall not be subject to such lock-up
period. With respect to the performance shares under the 2012-2014 Long Term

requested by Sorin prior to the Sorin Merger Effective Time, Holdco shall, no
later than the tenth (10th) day following the Sorin Merger Effective Time,
file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or

 



       
 

 



 

any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the Holdco Shares
subject to such converted Sorin Options, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement for so
long as the relevant Sorin Stock Plans or any successor equity plans, as
applicable, remain in effect and such registration of interests therein or the

those individuals who subsequent to the Sorin Merger will be subject to the
reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where
applicable, Holdco shall administer the Sorin Stock Plans or any successor

2.07 _and (ii) ensure that from and after the Sorin Merger Effective Time
neither Holdco nor any other party to this Agreement will be required to
deliver Sorin Shares or other capital stock of Sorin to any person pursuant to
or in settlement of the Sorin Equity Awards. The actions related to the Sorin
Equity Awards, as regulated under this _Section 2.07_, shall be described in
the Sorin Merger Terms to be submitted to the approval of Sorin Shareholder
Meeting. " _Sorin Equity Awards_ " means the Sorin Options, Sorin LTI Awards,
Sorin Deferred Bonus Shares and performance Shares under the 2012-2014 Long
Term Incentive Plan of Sorin.

 



 

 **SECTION 2.08 **_Sorin Rescission Shares_ _. _If the Sorin Merger is
consummated pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Sorin
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Sorin Merger Effective Time and
held by a holder who has exercised and perfected his or her rescission rights
in accordance with Italian Law (the " _Sorin Rescission Shares_ "), and to be
reallocated to other shareholders or third parties who have purchased such
Sorin Shares in accordance with Article 2437-quater of the Italian Civil Code,
shall be converted into or exchanged for the Sorin Merger Consideration
effective on or about the Sorin Merger Effective Time or at any other time
determined by Sorin and Holdco in accordance with applicable Law, and such

lease and operate its properties and assets, and to carry on and operate its
businesses as currently conducted (the " _Cyberonics Permits_ "), except where
the failure to possess such Cyberonics Permits, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Cyberonics Material
Adverse Effect. All Cyberonics Permits are in full force and effect, except
where the failure to be in full force and effect of any Cyberonics

 



      
 

 



 

Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Cyberonics Material Adverse Effect, and none of Cyberonics or the
Cyberonics Subsidiaries is in default or violation of any such Cyberonics
Permit, except where such default or violation, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Cyberonics Material
Adverse Effect. Neither Cyberonics nor any Cyberonics Subsidiary has received
any written notice during the period beginning on the date that is three (3)
years prior to the date of this Agreement from any Governmental Entity (i)
threatening to suspend, revoke, withdraw, modify or limit in any material and
adverse respect any Cyberonics Permit or (ii) that would reasonably be
expected to lead to the denial of any application for marketing approval or
clearance currently pending before the FDA or any other Governmental Entity,
except where such notice, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Cyberonics Material Adverse Effect.

be disclosed to the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, or committed an act,
made a statement, or failed to make a statement, in each such case, related to
the business of Cyberonics or any of the Cyberonics Subsidiaries, that, at the
time such disclosure was made, would reasonably be expected to provide a basis
for the FDA to invoke its policy respecting "Fraud, Untrue Statements of

conduct for which such person could be excluded from participating in

 



      
 

 



 

any federal health care program under Section 1128 of the Social Security Act
of 1935, as amended, or any similar Law or program. Neither Cyberonics nor any

Health Benefits Program statute, or the regulations promulgated pursuant to
such statutes or related foreign, state or local statutes or regulations.

 



 

(f) Cyberonics and to Cyberonicss knowledge, any contract manufacturers
assisting in the manufacture of medical devices or medical device components

the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Cyberonics Material Adverse
Effect. No manufacturing site for the manufacture of the Cyberonics medical
device products or their components (whether Cyberonics-owned or operated or
that of a contract manufacturer for any medical device products or related
components) has, since January 1, 2012, been subject to a Governmental Entity
(including the FDA) shutdown or import or export prohibition. Neither
Cyberonics nor, to Cyberonicss knowledge, any manufacturing site for the

Governmental Entity alleging or asserting noncompliance with any applicable
Health Care Laws or Cyberonics Permits or alleging a lack of safety or
effectiveness from the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, in each case
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Cyberonics Material Adverse Effect, and to Cyberonicss knowledge,
there is no such action or proceeding pending or threatened.

 



 

(h) Since January 1, 2012, to the knowledge of Cyberonics, in no clinical
trial directly conducted or sponsored by Cyberonics or any of the Cyberonics
Subsidiaries, or in which Cyberonics or any of the Cyberonics Subsidiaries has
participated, has the FDA, Institutional Review Board or equivalent approval,
to the extent such approval is required to be obtained or maintained by
Cyberonics or any of the Cyberonics Subsidiaries, been suspended or terminated
for material safety reasons.

 



 

(i) Since January 1, 2012, each of Cyberonics and the Cyberonics Subsidiaries
have neither voluntarily nor involuntarily initiated, conducted or issued,
caused to be initiated, conducted or issued any "Class I" recall or material
field corrective action, market withdrawal or replacement, safety alert,
warning, "dear doctor" letter, investigator notice, or similar notice or
action to wholesalers, distributors, retailers, healthcare professionals or
patients relating to an alleged lack of material safety, efficacy or
regulatory compliance of any Cyberonics medical device products nor is
Cyberonics or any Cyberonics Subsidiary currently considering initiating,
conducting or issuing any "Class I" recall of any Cyberonics medical device
product. To the knowledge of Cyberonics, there are no facts which are
reasonably likely to cause, and Cyberonics has not received since January 1,
2012 any written notice from the FDA or any other Governmental Entity (i)
requesting or requiring a "Class I" recall of any Cyberonics medical device
products sold or intended to be sold by Cyberonics or the Cyberonics
Subsidiaries, (ii) proposing or instituting a change in the marketing
classification or a material change in the labelling of any such Cyberonics

Adverse Effect.

 



 

(j) Cyberonicss and the Cyberonics Subsidiaries past and present collection,
use, analysis, disclosure, retention, storage, security and dissemination of
Personal Information comply (and since January 1, 2012 have complied) with (i)
any and all applicable Laws, including Information Privacy and Security Laws,
(ii) business associate agreements to which Cyberonics or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and (iii) Cyberonicss and the Cyberonics
Subsidiaries privacy policies, except, in each case, as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Cyberonics Material Adverse Effect. To the extent
required by applicable Law, each of Cyberonics and the Cyberonics Subsidiaries
have posted in accordance with Information Privacy and Security Laws a privacy
policy governing its use of Personal Information on its website and has
complied at all times

 



       
 

 



 

with such privacy policy, except as has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cyberonics Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(k) Cyberonics and the Cyberonics Subsidiaries are in compliance with all
applicable Laws relating to (i) the privacy of users of Cyberonics products or
services and all Internet websites owned, maintained or operated by Cyberonics
or any Cyberonics Subsidiary and (ii) the collection, storage, processing, use
and transfer of, and provision of notice of breach regarding, any personally
identifiable information, except in the case of each of _clause (i) _and
_(ii)_ , where the failure to be in compliance with such applicable Laws would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Cyberonics Material Adverse Effect. No claims are pending or, to the knowledge
of Cyberonics, are threatened in writing against Cyberonics or any of the
Cyberonics Subsidiaries by any person alleging a violation of such applicable
Laws referred to in the foregoing sentence or by any person alleging a
violation of such persons privacy or confidentiality rights or rights
relating to Personal Information, except for any such claim that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cyberonics
Material Adverse Effect.

(a) Since January 1, 2013, Cyberonics has filed with or otherwise furnished to
(as applicable) the SEC all registration statements, prospectuses, forms,

Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") (such
documents and any other documents filed by Cyberonics with the SEC, as have
been supplemented, modified or amended since the time of filing, collectively,
the " _Cyberonics SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates or,
if supplemented, modified or amended since the time of filing, as of the date
of the most recent supplement, modification or amendment, the Cyberonics SEC
Documents (i) did not at the time each such document was filed contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading and (ii) complied in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as the case may be,
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, in each case as in effect on the date each such document was
filed. The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
consolidated interim financial statements of Cyberonics (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) and the consolidated Cyberonics Subsidiaries included
in or incorporated by reference into the Cyberonics SEC Documents
(collectively, the " _Cyberonics Financial Statements_ ") (x) complied as of
their respective dates of filing in all material respects with the then
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, (y) were prepared in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP (as in effect in the United States on the date of such
Cyberonics Financial Statement) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of interim financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end
adjustments and

 



      
 

 



 

as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor or like
form under the Exchange Act) and (z) present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position and the consolidated comprehensive income,
results of operations, cash flows and equity of Cyberonics and the
consolidated Cyberonics Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods
referred to therein (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in
the case of interim financial statements, for normal and recurring year-end
adjustments and as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any
successor or like form under the Exchange Act). As of the date of this
Agreement, to the knowledge of Cyberonics, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments in any comment letters received by Cyberonics from the
SEC. As of the date of this Agreement, to the knowledge of Cyberonics, none
of the Cyberonics SEC Documents is the subject of any ongoing review by the
SEC. No Cyberonics Subsidiary is, or since January 1, 2013 has been, required
to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act.

 



 

(b) From January 1, 2013 to the date hereof, (i) neither Cyberonics nor any
Cyberonics Subsidiary has received, in writing, any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of Cyberonics or any of the Cyberonics
Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, and (ii) to the
knowledge of Cyberonics, no attorney representing Cyberonics or any of the
Cyberonics Subsidiaries has reported evidence of a material violation of
securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by Cyberonics
or any of the Cyberonics Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents to Cyberonicss board of directors or any
committee thereof pursuant to the rules of the SEC adopted under Section 307
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 



 

(c) Cyberonics has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs
(e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
as required by Rule 13a-15 promulgated under the Exchange Act designed to
ensure that (i) all material information required to be disclosed by
Cyberonics in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) material information relating to
Cyberonics, including its consolidated Cyberonics Subsidiaries, is made known
to the management of Cyberonics by others within those entities, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Since January 1, 2013 to the date hereof, Cyberonics has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to
the date hereof, to Cyberonicss auditors and the audit committee of
Cyberonicss board of directors (i) any "significant deficiencies" or
"material weakness" in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any
material respect Cyberonicss ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Cyberonicss
internal controls. As and to the extent described in the Cyberonics SEC
Documents, Cyberonics and the Cyberonics Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of

 



      
 

 



 

internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

agreement, contract, arrangement or other obligation, whether or not in
writing and whether or not funded, in each case, which is sponsored or
maintained by, or required to be contributed to, or with respect to which any
potential liability is borne by Cyberonics or any Cyberonics Subsidiary.

Cyberonics Subsidiary is in compliance with all Laws applicable to such
Cyberonics Benefit Plans, including ERISA and the Code, (iii) all

arbitrations, audits or hearings (other than for routine claims for benefits)
pending or, to the knowledge of Cyberonics, threatened with respect to any

(d) Each Cyberonics Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code has either received a favorable determination letter from
the IRS as to its qualified status, or has timely filed an application for a
favorable determination letter, or may rely upon an opinion letter for a
prototype or volume submitter plan, and, to the knowledge of Cyberonics, no
circumstance exists that would materially jeopardize the qualified status of
any such Cyberonics Benefit Plan, except as would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Cyberonics Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(e) No Cyberonics Benefit Plan provides health, life insurance or other
welfare benefits after retirement or other termination of employment, other
than (i) as required by Law, (ii) coverage or benefits the full cost of which
is borne by the employee or former employee (or any beneficiary of the
employee or former employee) or (iii) benefits provided for a period of less
than eighteen (18) months following termination of employment or during any
period during which the former employee is receiving severance pay.

 



 

(f) Neither Cyberonics nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has maintained or
contributed or has had any obligation of any sort in the last six (6) years
(i) under any employee benefit subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law or that is otherwise a defined benefit pension plan, or (ii) to any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA). No Cyberonics
Benefit Plan is a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in
Section 3(40) of ERISA).

 



 

(g) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone

employment) will (i) entitle any current or former employee, officer, director
or independent contractor of Cyberonics or any Cyberonics Subsidiary to any
severance pay or any material increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount of compensation
due to any such employee, director, officer or independent contractor, (iii)
directly or indirectly cause Cyberonics to transfer or set aside any assets to
fund any material benefits under any Cyberonics Benefit Plan, (iv) trigger any
other material obligation under any Cyberonics Benefit Plan or (v) result in
any material breach or violation of or default under, or limit Cyberonicss
right to materially amend or terminate, any Cyberonics Benefit Plan.

 



 

(h) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement will
result in the payment of any amount that could, individually or in combination
with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

 



 

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Cyberonics Material Adverse Effect, all Cyberonics Benefit Plans
subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside the United States (i) have
been maintained and

 



      
 

 



 

operated in accordance with, and are compliant with, their terms, all
applicable Laws, government taxation, social security and funding requirements
and with any agreement entered into with a union or labor organization, (ii)
to the extent required to be registered or approved by a foreign Governmental
Entity, has been registered with, or approved by, a foreign Governmental
Entity and, to the knowledge of Cyberonics, nothing has occurred that would
adversely affect such registration or approval, (iii) if such Cyberonics

been duly executed and delivered by each of Sorin, Holdco and Merger Sub, and
(assuming the valid authorization, execution and delivery of

 



      
 

 



 

the LOI, the POA and this Agreement by Cyberonics) constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of each of Sorin, Holdco and Merger Sub

Agreement by Sorin, Holdco or Merger Sub or the consummation by Sorin, Holdco
or Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated by the LOI, the POA or this

MSE and (v) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sorin Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

 **SECTION 4.05** ** **_Permits; Compliance with Laws_.

 



 

(a) Sorin and each Sorin Subsidiary is in possession of all material Permits
necessary for Sorin and each Sorin Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets, and to carry on and operate its businesses as currently
conducted (the " _Sorin Permits_ "), except where the failure to possess such
Sorin Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Sorin Material Adverse Effect. All Sorin Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect
of any Sorin Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Sorin Material Adverse Effect, and none of Sorin or the
Sorin Subsidiaries is in default or violation of any such Sorin Permit, except
where such default or violation, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Sorin Material Adverse Effect. Neither Sorin
nor any Sorin Subsidiary has received any written notice during the period
beginning on the date that is three (3) years prior to the date of this
Agreement from any Governmental Entity (i) threatening to suspend, revoke,
withdraw, modify or limit in any material and adverse respect any Sorin Permit
or (ii) that would reasonably be expected to lead to the denial of any
application for marketing approval or clearance currently pending before the
FDA or any other Governmental Entity, except where such notice, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Sorin Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Sorin and each Sorin Subsidiary is in compliance with (and since January
1, 2012 or, if later, its respective date of formation or organization, has
been in compliance with) all Health Care Laws applicable to their respective
businesses or operations, except where the failure to be so in compliance
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Sorin Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except as has not and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Sorin Material Adverse Effect, the design,
development, investigation, manufacture, testing, sale, marketing and
distribution of medical devices by or, to the knowledge of Sorin, on behalf of
Sorin is being, and has been since January 1, 2012, conducted in material
compliance with all applicable Health Care Laws, including, without

(d) Since January 1, 2012, all reports, documents, claims, permits, notices
and reports of adverse events required to be filed, maintained or furnished to
the FDA or any other Governmental Entity by Sorin and the Sorin Subsidiaries
have been so filed, maintained or furnished in a timely manner, except where
failure to file, maintain or furnish such reports, documents, claims, permits,
notices or adverse event reports has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sorin Material Adverse
Effect. All such reports, documents, claims, permits and notices were complete
and accurate in all respects on the date filed (or were corrected in or
supplemented by a subsequent filing), except as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Sorin Material Adverse Effect.
To the knowledge of Sorin, neither Sorin nor any of the Sorin Subsidiaries,
nor any officer, employee, agent or distributor of Sorin or any of the Sorin
Subsidiaries, has made an untrue statement of a material fact or a fraudulent
statement to the FDA or any other Governmental Entity, failed to disclose a
material fact required to be disclosed to the FDA or any other Governmental
Entity, or committed an act, made a statement, or failed to make a statement,
in each such case, related to the business of Sorin or any of the Sorin
Subsidiaries, that, at the time such disclosure was made, would reasonably be
expected to provide a basis for the FDA to invoke its policy respecting
"Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery, and Illegal Gratuities"
set forth in 56 Fed. Reg. 46191 (September 10, 1991) or for the FDA or any
other Governmental Entity to invoke any similar policy. Neither Sorin nor any
of the Sorin Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of Sorin, any officer,
employee, agent or distributor of Sorin or any of the Sorin Subsidiaries, has
been debarred or convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for which
debarment is mandated by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(a) or any similar Law or authorized
by 21 U.S.C. § 335a(b) or any similar Law. Neither Sorin nor any of the Sorin

distributor of Sorin or any of the Sorin Subsidiaries, has been debarred,
suspended, or excluded from participation in any federal health care program
or convicted of any crime or engaged in any conduct for which such person
could be excluded from participating in any federal health care program under
Section 1128 of the Social Security Act of 1935, as amended, or any similar
Law or program. Neither Sorin nor any of the Sorin Subsidiaries is party to or

Sorin, any of their respective Representatives, have engaged in any activities
which are cause for or have resulted in criminal or material civil penalties
against, or mandatory or permissive exclusion of, Sorin or any of the Sorin
Subsidiaries from Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federal health care program
under any Health Care Law, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program
statute, or the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statutes or related
foreign, state or local statutes or regulations.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Sorin and, to Sorins knowledge, any contract manufacturers assisting in
the manufacture of medical devices or medical device components are, and,
since January 1, 2012, have been, in compliance with FDAs device registration
and listing requirements to the extent required by applicable Health Care Laws
insofar as they pertain to the manufacture of medical devices or medical
device components for Sorin, except as has not and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Sorin Material Adverse
Effect. Sorin has not received written notification of any pending or
threatened claim, suit, proceeding, hearing, enforcement, audit,
investigation, arbitration or other action from any Governmental Entity,
including, without limitation, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General,
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights, the
U.S. Department of Justice, or any comparable state or federal Governmental
Entity alleging potential or actual non-compliance by, or liability of, Sorin
under any Health Care Law.

 



 

(g) Sorin has not received any written notice or other communication from the
FDA or any other Governmental Entity contesting the pre-market clearance or
approval of any of the Sorin medical device products, or alleging that the
labeling and promotion of any of the Sorin medical device products fail to
comply with Health Care Laws, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Sorin Material Adverse Effect. No
manufacturing site for the manufacture of the Sorin medical device products or
their components (whether Sorin-owned or operated or that of a contract
manufacturer for any medical device products or related components) has, since
January 1, 2012, been subject to a Governmental Entity (including the FDA)
shutdown or import or export prohibition. Neither Sorin nor, to Sorins
knowledge, any manufacturing site for the manufacture of any Sorin medical
device products or related components of Sorin medical device products
(whether Sorin-owned or operated or that of a contract manufacturer for the
medical device products or related components) has received, since January 1,
2012, any FDA Form 483 or other Governmental Entity notice of inspectional
observations or adverse findings, "warning letters," "untitled letters" or
similar correspondence or notice from the FDA or other Governmental Entity
alleging or asserting noncompliance with any applicable Health Care Laws or
Sorin Permits or alleging a lack of safety or effectiveness from the FDA or
any other Governmental Entity, in each case except as would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Sorin Material Adverse
Effect, and to Sorins knowledge, there is no such action or proceeding
pending or threatened.

 



 

(h) Since January 1, 2012, to the knowledge of Sorin, in no clinical trial
directly conducted or sponsored by Sorin or any of the Sorin Subsidiaries, or
in which Sorin or any of the Sorin Subsidiaries has participated, has the FDA,
Institutional Review Board or equivalent approval, to the extent such approval
is required to be obtained or maintained by Sorin or any of the Sorin
Subsidiaries, been suspended or terminated for material safety reasons.

 



 

(i) Since January 1, 2012, each of Sorin and the Sorin Subsidiaries have
neither voluntarily nor involuntarily initiated, conducted or issued, caused
to be initiated, conducted or issued any "Class I" recall or material field
corrective action, market

 



      
 

 



 

withdrawal or replacement, safety alert, warning, "dear doctor" letter,
investigator notice, or similar notice or action to wholesalers, distributors,
retailers, healthcare professionals or patients relating to an alleged lack of
material safety, efficacy or regulatory compliance of any Sorin medical device
products nor is Sorin or any Sorin Subsidiary currently considering
initiating, conducting or issuing any "Class I" recall of any Sorin medical
device product. To the knowledge of Sorin, there are no facts which are
reasonably likely to cause, and Sorin has not received since January 1, 2012
any written notice from the FDA or any other Governmental Entity (i)
requesting or requiring a "Class I" recall of any Sorin medical device
products sold or intended to be sold by Sorin or the Sorin Subsidiaries, (ii)

information relating to Sorin, including its consolidated Sorin Subsidiaries,
is made known to the directors of Sorin as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure and to prepare the documentation

reviews system in relation to the financial reporting process which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material respect Sorins ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial data and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have

or other obligation, whether or not in writing and whether or not funded, in
each case, which is sponsored or maintained by, or required to be contributed

Laws, including ERISA and the Code, (ii) Sorin and each Sorin Subsidiary is in
compliance with all Laws applicable to such Sorin Benefit Plans, including

(d) Each Sorin Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a)
of the Code has either received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
as to its qualified status, or has timely filed an application for a favorable
determination letter, or may rely upon an opinion letter for a prototype or
volume submitter plan, and, to the knowledge of Sorin, no circumstance exists
that would materially jeopardize the qualified status of any such Sorin
Benefit Plan, except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually

benefits after retirement or other termination of employment, other than (i)
as required by Law, (ii) coverage or benefits the full cost of which is borne

former employee) or (iii) benefits provided for a period of less than eighteen
(18) months following termination of employment or during any period during
which the former employee is receiving severance pay.

 



 

(f) Neither Sorin nor any Sorin Subsidiary has or is expected to incur any

them or any of their ERISA Affiliates. With respect to any Sorin Benefit Plan
subject to the minimum funding requirements of Section 412 of the Code or
Title IV of ERISA, (i) no such plan is, or is expected to be, in "at-risk"
status (within the meaning of Section 303(i)(4)(A) of ERISA or Section
430(i)(4)(A) of the Code), (ii) as of the last day of the most recent plan

any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to

4062, 4063 or 4041 of ERISA occurred. Neither Sorin nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has maintained or contributed or

 



      
 

 



 

has had any obligation of any sort in the last six (6) years to any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA). No Sorin Benefit
Plan is a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40)
of ERISA).

 



 

(g) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation
of the Mergers or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone

employment) will (i) entitle any current or former employee, officer, director

pay or any material increase in severance pay, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or materially increase the amount of compensation due to
any such employee, director, officer or independent contractor, (iii) directly

amend or terminate, any Sorin Benefit Plan.

with any other such payment, constitute an "excess parachute payment" as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code.

 



 

(i) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Sorin Material Adverse Effect, all Sorin Benefit Plans subject to

meet all the requirements for such treatment, (iv) if such Sorin Benefit Plans
are intended or required to be funded and/or book-reserved, are fully funded
and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial
assumptions and in accordance with any applicable requirements and (v) there

required to be funded, the assets of such Sorin Benefit Plan are sufficient
under applicable local Law to provide for the payment of the relevant benefits
in full or (ii) if not required to be funded, the book reserves (determined in

union or other labor organizational campaign is in progress with respect to
the employees of Sorin or any Sorin Subsidiary. Sorin has made available to
Cyberonics true and complete copies of each Sorin Labor Agreement. None of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers or

any third party (including any labor organization or Governmental Entity) to
any payments under any of the Sorin Labor Agreements, and Sorin and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respect with their obligations
pursuant to all notification and bargaining obligations arising under any
Sorin Labor Agreements. None of the Sorin Labor Agreements guarantee minimum

Subsidiaries, (iv) all contracts for the supply of works or services entered

Sorins and its Subsidiaries contractors (and sub-contractors) have regularly

or negotiations with any persons that are ongoing with respect to any
Cyberonics Competing Proposal, or any inquiry, proposal or offer that would

understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement

this Agreement (and in any event no later than two (2) Business Days following
the date of this Agreement), Cyberonics shall request the prompt return or
destruction of all confidential information previously furnished in connection
with a potential Cyberonics Competing Proposal to any person with whom
Cyberonics or a Cyberonics Representative has had discussions or negotiations
with respect to a Cyberonics Competing Proposal in the last twelve (12) months
and shall terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously
granted to any such person or its Representatives.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.03(a)_,
if at any time following the execution of this Agreement and prior to
Cyberonics obtaining the Cyberonics Stockholder Approval, (i) Cyberonics has
received a bona fide written Cyberonics Competing Proposal that has not
resulted from a material breach of _Section 5.03(a)_, (ii) the board of
directors of Cyberonics determines in good faith, after

 



      
 

 



 

consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel, that such
Cyberonics Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Cyberonics Superior Proposal and (iii) the board of directors of
Cyberonics determines, after consultation with its outside counsel, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
the stockholders of Cyberonics under applicable Law, then Cyberonics may,
subject to compliance with this _Section 5.03_, (A) furnish information with
respect to Cyberonics and the Cyberonics Subsidiaries to the person making
such Cyberonics Competing Proposal and its Representatives and (B) participate
in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Cyberonics
Competing Proposal and its Representatives regarding such Cyberonics Competing
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that Cyberonics (1) will not, and will not
permit or authorize the Cyberonics Subsidiaries or any Representative of
Cyberonics or the Cyberonics Subsidiaries to, disclose any information to such
person without first entering into an Acceptable Cyberonics Confidentiality
Agreement with such person and (2) will as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within 24 hours thereafter) provide or make available to Sorin any
material information concerning Cyberonics or the Cyberonics Subsidiaries
provided or made available to such other person (or its Representatives) that
was not previously provided or made available to Sorin. Subject to the
undertakings of the Confidentiality Agreement, Cyberonics will promptly (and
in any event, within 24 hours) notify Sorin in the event (x) any Cyberonics
Competing Proposal is received by, (y) any information is requested in
connection with any Cyberonics Competing Proposal from, or (z) any discussions
or negotiations with respect to a Cyberonics Competing Proposal are sought to
be initiated with, Cyberonics, any Cyberonics Subsidiary or any Cyberonics
Representative, and shall (I) indicate, in connection with such notice, the
identity of the person making such Cyberonics Competing Proposal, requesting
such information or seeking to initiate such discussions or negotiations,
together with a summary of the material terms and conditions of such

Cyberonics Competing Proposal) or the nature of the request for information,
as applicable, and (II) thereafter keep Sorin reasonably informed, on a
reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any such discussions or
negotiations. Cyberonics shall not, and shall cause the Cyberonics
Subsidiaries not to, enter into any agreement with any person that prohibits
Cyberonics from providing to Sorin any of the information required to be
provided to Sorin under this _Section 5.03(b) _within the time periods
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
5.03_, the board of directors of Cyberonics may correspond in writing with any
person making a Cyberonics Competing Proposal solely to request clarification
of the terms and conditions thereof so as to determine whether such Cyberonics
Competing Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Cyberonics Superior Proposal, provided that such written correspondence is
delivered concurrently to Sorin. Cyberonics shall not terminate, waive, amend
or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any "standstill" or
confidentiality agreement to which Cyberonics is a party, and Cyberonics shall
enforce the provisions of each such agreement. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cyberonics shall be permitted to
fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill", confidentiality or similar
obligation of any person if the board of directors of Cyberonics determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure

 



      
 

 



 

to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
Cyberonicss stockholders under applicable Law; _provided,_ that Cyberonics
promptly advises Sorin that it is taking such action and the identity of the
party or parties with respect to which it is taking such action; _provided,
further_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict Cyberonics from permitting a
person to orally request the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation to
the extent necessary to avoid violating fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in _Sections 5.03(d) _and _5.03(e)_ , neither the
board of directors of Cyberonics nor any committee thereof shall (i)
authorize, approve or recommend, or publicly propose to authorize, approve or
recommend, any Cyberonics Competing Proposal, (ii) withhold or withdraw (or
modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Sorin), or publicly propose to
withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Sorin), the
Cyberonics Board Recommendation (any action set forth in the foregoing _clause
(i) _or _(ii)_ , a " _Cyberonics Change of Recommendation_") or (iii) approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit
Cyberonics or any Cyberonics Subsidiary to execute or enter into, any
Cyberonics Acquisition Agreement.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the Cyberonics Stockholder
Approval and subject to compliance with _Section 7.02(b)(i) _and this
_Section 5.03(d)_, the board of directors of Cyberonics may:

 



 

(i) (A) make a Cyberonics Change of Recommendation in connection with a
Cyberonics Superior Proposal or (B) cause Cyberonics to enter into a
Cyberonics Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Cyberonics Superior
Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(h)_, if (v)
there has been no material breach of this _Section 5.03_, (w) a bona fide,
written Cyberonics Competing Proposal is made to Cyberonics by a third person
and the board of directors of Cyberonics determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside counsel, that
such Cyberonics Competing Proposal constitutes a Cyberonics Superior Proposal,
(x) Cyberonics provides Sorin 96 hours prior written notice of its intention
to take such action (a " _Notice of Cyberonics Superior Proposal Action_ "),
which notice shall include the identity of the person making such Cyberonics
Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions of such Cyberonics
Superior Proposal and, if applicable, shall attach the proposed Cyberonics
Acquisition Agreement providing for such Cyberonics Superior Proposal (it
being agreed that, in each case, neither the delivery of such notice by
Cyberonics nor any public announcement thereof that the board of directors of
Cyberonics determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
is required to be made under applicable Law shall constitute a Cyberonics
Change of Recommendation), (y) to the extent requested by Sorin, Cyberonics
negotiates in good faith with Sorin with respect to any changes to the terms
of this Agreement proposed by Sorin for at least 96 hours following delivery
by Cyberonics of such Notice of Cyberonics Superior Proposal Action (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to any material term of any

 



      
 

 



 

Cyberonics Competing Proposal will be deemed a new Cyberonics Competing
Proposal for purposes of this _Section 5.03(d)_, including with respect to
the notice period referenced in this _Section 5.03(d)(i)_, except that the 96
hours period shall be reduced to 72 hours for such purposes) and (z) taking
into account any binding changes to the terms of this Agreement definitively
and irrevocably agreed to by Sorin in writing, the board of directors of
Cyberonics determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Cyberonics Competing Proposal
would continue to constitute a Cyberonics Superior Proposal if such changes
irrevocably agreed to by Sorin in writing were to be given effect; or

 



 

(ii) make a Cyberonics Change of Recommendation other than in connection with
a Cyberonics Competing Proposal if (A) Cyberonics provides Sorin 96 hours
prior written notice of its intention to take such action (a " _Notice of
Cyberonics Change of Recommendation_ "), which notice shall specify, in
reasonable detail, the reasons therefor (it being agreed that neither the
delivery of such Notice of Cyberonics Change of Recommendation by Cyberonics
nor any public announcement thereof that the board of directors of Cyberonics
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, is required
to be made under applicable Law shall constitute a Cyberonics Change of
Recommendation), (B) Cyberonics has negotiated in good faith with Sorin with
respect to any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Sorin for at
least 96 hours following delivery by Cyberonics of such Notice of Cyberonics
Change of Recommendation and (C) taking into account any binding changes to
the terms of this Agreement definitively and irrevocably agreed to by Sorin in
writing, the board of directors of Cyberonics determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the board of
directors of Cyberonics under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.03_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Cyberonics or the board of directors of Cyberonics from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable United States
federal or state Law with respect to a Cyberonics Competing Proposal,
including taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Cyberonics a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders) or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of Cyberonics
if the board of directors of Cyberonics determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
Cyberonics under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that _clause (ii)
_of this _Section 5.03(e) _shall not be deemed to permit the board of
directors of Cyberonics to make a Cyberonics Change of Recommendation or take
any of the actions referred to in _Section 5.03(c)(iii)_, except, in each
case, to the extent permitted by _Section 5.03(d) _(for the avoidance of
doubt, it being agreed that the issuance by Cyberonics or the board of
directors of Cyberonics of a "stop, look and listen" statement pending
disclosure of its position, as contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9

 



      
 

 



 

promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders), shall not constitute a Cyberonics Change of Recommendation).

 



 

(f) Neither Cyberonics nor the board of directors of Cyberonics shall take any
action to exempt any person or entity (other than Holdco, Sorin, Merger Sub
and their respective affiliates) from the restrictions on "business
combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL or any other Takeover
Statute or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply.

 



 

(g) Cyberonics agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 5.03_ by any Cyberonics Representative shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement (including this _Section 5.03_) by Cyberonics.

 



 

 **SECTION 5.04** ** **_No Solicitation by Sorin; Sorin Change of
Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.04_, Sorin shall, and shall cause
the Sorin Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, (i)

lead to a Sorin Superior Proposal and (iii) the board of directors of Sorin

compliance with this _Section 5.04_, (A) furnish information with respect to
Sorin and the Sorin Subsidiaries to the person making such Sorin Competing
Proposal and its Representatives and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the person making such Sorin Competing Proposal and its

disclose any information to such person without first entering into an
Acceptable Sorin Confidentiality Agreement with such person and (2) will as
promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours thereafter) provide

anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.04_, the board of directors of
Sorin may correspond in writing with any person making a Sorin Competing
Proposal solely to request clarification of the terms and conditions thereof
so as to determine whether such Sorin Competing Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Sorin Superior Proposal, provided that
such written correspondence is delivered concurrently to Cyberonics. Sorin
shall not terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant
permission under, any "standstill" or confidentiality agreement to which Sorin
is a party, and Sorin shall enforce the provisions of each such agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Sorin
shall be permitted to fail to enforce any provision of any "standstill",
confidentiality or similar obligation of any person if the board of directors
of Sorin determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to Sorins stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that Sorin promptly advises Cyberonics that it is taking such action and the
identity of the party or parties with respect to which it is taking such
action; _provided, further_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict Sorin from
permitting a person to orally

 



      
 

 



 

request the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation to the extent
necessary to avoid violating fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in _Sections 5.04(d) _or _5.04(e)_ , neither the
board of directors of Sorin nor any committee thereof shall (i) authorize,
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to authorize, approve or recommend,
any Sorin Competing Proposal, (ii) withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify
in a manner adverse to Cyberonics), or publicly propose to withhold or

_(ii)_ , a " _Sorin Change of Recommendation_") or (iii) approve or recommend,
or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit Sorin or any
Sorin Subsidiary to execute or enter into, any Sorin Acquisition Agreement.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the Sorin Shareholder Approval and
subject to compliance with _Section 7.02(b)(ii) _and this _Section 5.04(d)_,
the board of directors of Sorin may:

 



 

(i) (A) make a Sorin Change of Recommendation in connection with a Cyberonics
Superior Proposal or (B) cause Sorin to enter into a Sorin Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Sorin Superior Proposal and terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(i)_, if (v) there has been no material
breach of this _Section 5.04_, (w) a bona fide, written Sorin Competing
Proposal is made to Sorin by a third person and the board of directors of
Sorin determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside counsel, that such Sorin Competing Proposal constitutes a
Sorin Superior Proposal, (x) Sorin provides Cyberonics 96 hours prior written
notice of its intention to take such action (a " _Notice of Sorin Superior
Proposal Action_ "), which notice shall include the identity of the person
making such Sorin Superior Proposal and the material terms and conditions of
such Sorin Superior Proposal and, if applicable, shall attach the proposed
Sorin Acquisition Agreement providing for such Sorin Superior Proposal (it
being agreed that, in each case, neither the delivery of such notice by Sorin
nor any public announcement thereof that the board of directors of Sorin
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, is required
to be made under applicable Law shall constitute a Sorin Change of
Recommendation), (y) to the extent requested by Cyberonics, Sorin negotiates
in good faith with Cyberonics with respect to any changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Cyberonics for at least 96 hours following delivery by
Sorin of such Notice of Sorin Superior Proposal Action (it being understood
and agreed that any amendment to any material term of any Sorin Competing
Proposal will be deemed a new Sorin Competing Proposal for purposes of this
_Section 5.04(d)_, including with respect to the notice period referenced in
this _Section 5.04(d)(i)_, except that the 96 hours period shall be reduced
to 72 hours for such purposes) and (z) taking into account any binding changes
to the terms of this Agreement definitively and irrevocably agreed to by
Cyberonics in writing, the board of directors of Sorin determines in good
faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that such

 



      
 

 



 

Sorin Competing Proposal would continue to constitute a Sorin Superior
Proposal if such changes irrevocably agreed to by Sorin in writing were to be
given effect; or

 



 

(ii) make a Sorin Change of Recommendation other than in connection with a
Sorin Competing Proposal if (A) Sorin provides Cyberonics 96 hours prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (a " _Notice of Sorin
Change of Recommendation_ "), which notice shall specify, in reasonable
detail, the reasons therefor (it being agreed that neither the delivery of
such Notice of Sorin Change of Recommendation by Sorin nor any public
announcement thereof that the board of directors of Sorin determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, is required to be made under
applicable Law shall constitute a Sorin Change of Recommendation), (B) Sorin
has negotiated in good faith with Cyberonics with respect to any changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Cyberonics for at least 96 hours
following delivery by Sorin of such Notice of Sorin Change of Recommendation
and (C) taking into account any binding changes to the terms of this Agreement
definitively and irrevocably agreed to by Cyberonics in writing, the board of
directors of Sorin has determined in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the members of the board of
directors of Sorin under applicable Law.

 



 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.04_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Sorin or the board of directors of Sorin from complying with
its disclosure obligations under applicable Italian Laws with respect to a
Sorin Competing Proposal, including making any disclosure to the shareholders
of Sorin if the board of directors of Sorin determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the shareholders of Sorin
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that this _Section 5.04(e)
_shall not be deemed to permit the board of directors of Sorin to make a Sorin
Change of Recommendation or take any of the actions referred to in _Section
5.04(c)(iii)_, except, in each case, to the extent permitted by _Section
5.04(d)._

 



 

(f) Neither Sorin nor the board of directors of Sorin shall take any action to
exempt any person or entity (other than Holdco, Sorin, Merger Sub and their
respective affiliates) from the provisions of "control share acquisitions"
contained in any Takeover Statute or otherwise cause such restrictions not to
apply.

 



 

(g) Sorin agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this
_Section 5.04_ by any Sorin Representative shall be deemed to be a breach of
this Agreement (including this _Section 5.04_) by Sorin.

the issuance and subsequent trading of Holdco Shares on the NASDAQ do not
attract a charge to stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax in the United
Kingdom, _provided_ , _however_ , that Holdco and Sorin shall be treated as

Termination Fee nor the Sorin Termination Fee is a penalty but rather is a
reasonable estimate of damages necessary to compensate Cyberonics or Sorin, as
the case may be, in the circumstances in which the Cyberonics Termination Fee
or Sorin Termination Fee, as applicable, is payable. Sorin and Cyberonics
hereby acknowledge and agree that the amount of the Cyberonics Termination Fee
or Sorin Termination Fee, if and as applicable, is fair, after taking into
account the value of the Sorin Merger and Cyberonics Merger, the other
transactions contemplated hereby and all the costs and expenses already
incurred by the parties before entering into this Agreement. In no event shall
Cyberonics, on the one hand, or Sorin, on the other hand, be required to pay
to the other party more than one Cyberonics Termination Fee or Sorin
Termination Fee, if and as applicable, pursuant to this _Section 7.02(b)_.

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by either Sorin or
Cyberonics pursuant to _Section 7.01(b) _(but only if the Cyberonics
Stockholder Meeting has not been held by the Outside Date), by Sorin or
Cyberonics pursuant to _Section 7.01(c) _or by Sorin pursuant to _Section
7.01(j)_, then in each case, Cyberonics shall pay to Sorin, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, the Cyberonics Expense Reimbursement. In the
event that this Agreement is terminated by either Sorin or Cyberonics pursuant
to _Section 7.01(b) _(but only if the Sorin Shareholder Meeting has not been
held prior the Outside Date), by Sorin or Cyberonics pursuant to _Section
7.01(d)_, by Cyberonics pursuant to _Section 7.01(k)_, or by Cyberonics
pursuant to _Section 7.01(l)_, then in each case Sorin shall pay to
Cyberonics, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Sorin Expense
Reimbursement. In the event any Cyberonics Termination Fee is payable by
Cyberonics after the time Cyberonics pays any expense reimbursement pursuant
to this _Section 7.02(c)_, the amount of the Cyberonics Termination Fee
payable by Cyberonics shall be reduced by the amount of such expense
reimbursement actually paid to Sorin. In the event any Sorin Termination Fee
is payable by Sorin after the time Sorin pays any expense reimbursement
pursuant to this _Section 7.02(c)_, the amount of the Sorin Termination Fee
payable by Sorin shall be reduced by the amount of such expense reimbursement
actually paid to Cyberonics.

 



 

(d) The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that: (i) upon any
termination of this Agreement where either the Cyberonics Termination Fee or
Sorin Termination Fee becomes due and payable, the payment of the Cyberonics
Termination Fee or Sorin Termination Fee, as applicable, pursuant to _Section
7.02(b) _shall be in full and complete satisfaction of any and all monetary
damages of the party to which such Cyberonics Termination Fee or Sorin
Termination Fee, as applicable, is paid and its affiliates, and their
respective directors, officers and other Representatives, arising out of or
related to this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including as a result of any breach of this Agreement, the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated

 



      
 

 



 

by this Agreement, and any claims or actions under applicable Law arising out
of such breach, termination or failure; and (ii) in no event shall the party
to which such Cyberonics Termination Fee or Sorin Termination Fee, as
applicable, is paid or its affiliates, or any of their respective directors,
officers or other Representatives, be entitled to seek or obtain any recovery
or judgment in excess of the Cyberonics Termination Fee or Sorin Termination
Fee, as applicable (plus, in the case the Cyberonics Termination Fee or Sorin
Termination Fee, as applicable, is not timely paid, the amounts described in
_Section 7.02(e)_) against any other party to this Agreement, their
affiliates and any of their respective directors, officers and other
Representatives.

 



 

(e) Each of Sorin, Cyberonics, Holdco and Merger Sub acknowledges that (i) the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement;
accordingly, if a party hereto fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant
to _Section 7.02(b) _or _7.02(c) _and, in order to obtain such payment,
another party hereto commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
first party for the payment set forth in _Section 7.02(b) _or _7.02(c) _or
any portion thereof, such first party shall pay to the other party the other
partys costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses)
in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount from the
date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made.

 



 

 **SECTION 7.03** ** **_Amendment_ _. _This Agreement may be amended by
Cyberonics and Sorin at any time prior to the Cyberonics Merger Effective
Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that, after receipt of the Cyberonics
Stockholder Approval or Sorin Shareholder Approval, as applicable, no
amendment may be made which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by Cyberonicss or Sorins
stockholders or shareholders, as applicable, without obtaining such further
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed by each of the parties hereto. For the avoidance of doubt, this
_Section 7.03_ shall survive the Effective Times.

 



 

 **SECTION 7.04** ** **_Waiver_ _. _At any time prior to the Effective Times,
Sorin, Holdco and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Cyberonics, on the other
hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other, (b) waive any breach of the representations and
warranties of the other contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (c) to the extent permitted by Law, waive compliance by the other
with any of the covenants or conditions contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after receipt of the Cyberonics Stockholder Approval or the
Sorin Shareholder Approval, as applicable, there may not be any extension or
waiver of this Agreement which, by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by the stockholders of
Cyberonics or the shareholders of Sorin, as applicable, without obtaining such
further approval. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound
thereby, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII _ 
GENERAL PROVISIONS_**

 



 

 **SECTION 8.01** ** **_No Survival of Representations and Warranties_ _.
_None of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in
any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Times. Except for any covenant or agreement that by its terms
contemplates performance after the Sorin Merger Effective Time or the
Cyberonics Merger Effective Time, as applicable, none of the covenants and

provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa. As used in this
Agreement, the words "include" and "including," and words of similar meaning,

Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Sorin Merger Effective Time, on
the part of the Sorin Merger Surviving Company, to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Cyberonics

Surviving Company or Cyberonics Merger Surviving Corporation to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the

provisions of the Laws of the State of Delaware shall apply with respect to
(A) the Cyberonics Merger, fiduciary duties of Cyberonicss board of directors

(b) Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any other party or its
successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in the Court of Chancery
of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be unavailable, any state or
Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware), and each of the parties
hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sorin, Holdco and Merger Sub each irrevocably
agrees that any equitable action or proceeding, including the seeking of
specific performance under _Section 8.11_ of this Agreement and damages
claims in connection with such equitable action or proceeding, may be brought
by Cyberonics, in its discretion, the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware (or, if such court shall be unavailable, any state or Federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware), any court of England and Wales or any court
of Italy. Subject to the preceding sentence, each of the parties agrees not to
commence any action, suit or proceeding relating thereto except in the courts
described above in Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such
court as described herein. Each of the parties further agrees that notice as
provided herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the parties
further waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the
parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (a) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described herein for
any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) that (i)
the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or

 



      
 

 



 

proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER OR RELATE TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.09._

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 8.09_ shall survive the Cyberonics
Merger Effective Time.

 



 

 **SECTION 8.10** ** **_Counterparts_ _. _This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by
facsimile or by electronic delivery in .pdf format shall be sufficient to bind
the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

 **SECTION 8.11** ** **_Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly,
subject to _Section 8.11(c)_, the parties acknowledge and agree that Sorin
and Cyberonics shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in addition subject to _Section 7.02(d)_ and _Section 8.11(c)_ , to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 8.11(c)_, each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief as provided herein on the basis that (i) it has an adequate remedy at
Law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at Law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce

 



      
 

 



 

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or
injunction.

 



 

(c) In no event shall Cyberonicss or Sorins right to seek specific
performance pursuant to this _Section 8.11_ reduce, restrict or otherwise
limit any right of such party to terminate this Agreement and to be paid the
Cyberonics Termination Fee or Sorin Termination Fee, as and if applicable;
_provided_ , that in no event shall Cyberonics or Sorin be entitled to both
specific performance pursuant to this _Section 8.11_ and payment of the Sorin
Termination Fee or the Cyberonics Termination Fee, as applicable.

(d) reference to a document or information being "sent", "supplied" or "given"
to or by a person means such document or information, or a copy of such
document or information, being sent, supplied, given, delivered, issued or
made available to or by, or served on or by, or deposited with or by that
person by any method authorised by these Articles, and "sending", "supplying"
and "giving" shall be construed accordingly;

 



 

(e) references to documents "being signed" or to "signature" include a

and, in the case of a communication in electronic form, such references are to
its being authenticated as specified in the Companies Act;

 



 

(f) references to "writing" include references to typewriting, printing,
lithography, photography and any other modes of representing or reproducing
words in a legible and non-transitory form, whether sent or supplied in

shall be construed accordingly;

 



 

(g) references to "other" and "otherwise" shall not be construed _ejusdem

(o) references to the "entire" Board are to the total number of director
positions on the Board, without regard to any vacancies, at the relevant time.
As an example, if there are seven director positions, five of which are filled
and two of which are vacant, the entire Board shall be seven directors, so an
action required to be taken by a majority of the entire Board shall require
the approval of four of the five Directors in office and any action requiring
the approval of two-thirds of the entire Board shall require the approval of
all five Directors in office.

 



      
 

 



 

2.5 The headings are inserted for convenience only and do not affect the
construction of these Articles.

 



 

 **3.** ** ****LIABILITY OF MEMBERS**

 



 

The liability of each member is limited to the amount, if any, unpaid on the
shares held by that member.

 



 

 **4.** ** ****SHARES AND SHARE CAPITAL**

 



 

4.1 The Company may issue the following shares in the capital of the Company
with rights attaching to them and denominated, in each case, as follows:

 



 

(a) **Ordinary Shares** , each of which shall be denominated in British Pounds
Sterling with a nominal value of £1. Each Ordinary Share shall be issued with
one vote attaching to it for voting purposes in respect of all matters on
which Voting Shares in the capital of the Company have voting rights and shall
form a single class with the other Voting Shares in the capital of the Company
for such purposes. The holders of Ordinary Shares shall, in respect of the
Ordinary Shares held by them, be entitled to receive notice of, attend and
speak at and vote at, general meetings of the Company.

 



 

4.2 Notwithstanding Article 4.1, subject to the provisions of the Companies
Act, and without prejudice to any rights attached to any existing shares or
class of shares:

 



 

(a) any share may be issued in one or more classes with such rights or
restrictions as the Company may by special resolution determine or, subject to
and in default of such determination, as the Board shall determine; and

 



 

(b) shares may be issued which are to be redeemed or are to be liable to be
redeemed at the option of the Company or the holder and the Board may
determine the terms, conditions and manner of redemption of shares provided
that it does so before the shares are allotted.

 



 

4.3 The Company may exercise all powers of paying commissions or brokerage
conferred or permitted by the Companies Act. Subject to the provisions of the
Companies Act, any such commission may be satisfied by the payment of cash or
by the allotment of fully or partly paid shares or partly in one way and
partly in the other and may be in respect of a conditional or an absolute
subscription.

 



 

4.4 Except as required by law, no person shall be recognised by the Company as
holding any share upon any trust. Except as otherwise provided by these
Articles or by law, the Company shall not be bound by or recognise (even if
having notice of it) any equitable, contingent, future, partial or other claim
or any interest in any share (or in any fractional part of a share) except the
holders absolute ownership of the entirety of the share and all the rights
attaching to it.

 



 

4.5 Without prejudice to any powers which the Company or the Board may have to
issue, allot, dispose of, convert, or otherwise deal with or make arrangements
in relation to, shares and other securities in any form:

 



 

(a) the Board may permit the holding of shares in any class of shares in
uncertificated form; and

 



 

(b) the Company may issue shares in uncertificated form and may convert shares
from certificated form to uncertificated form and _vice versa_.

 



      
 

 



 

4.6 Shares in the capital of the Company that fall within a certain class
shall not form a separate class of shares from other shares in that class
because any share in that class is held in uncertificated form.

 



 

4.7 Where the Company is entitled under any provision of the Companies Act or
these Articles to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, forfeit, re-allot,
accept the surrender of, or otherwise enforce a lien over, a share held in
uncertificated form, the Company shall be entitled, subject to the provisions
of the Companies Act and these Articles to:

 



 

(a) require the holder of that uncertificated share by notice to change that
share into certificated form within the period specified in the notice and to
hold that share in certificated form so long as required by the Company; and

 



 

(b) take any action that the Board considers appropriate to achieve the sale,
transfer, disposal, forfeiture, reallotment or surrender of that share, or
otherwise to enforce a lien in respect of that share.

 



 

4.8 If and to the extent that any provision of these Articles is inconsistent
with the holding of or transfer of title to shares in uncertificated form it
shall not apply to any share of any class which is in uncertificated form.

 



 

 **5.** ** ****AUTHORITY TO ALLOT SHARES AND DISAPPLICATION OF PRE-EMPTION
RIGHTS**

 



 

5.1 In addition to any similar authority which has not been fully utilised,
the Board shall be generally and unconditionally authorised pursuant to
section 551 of the Companies Act to:

 



 

(a) exercise all of the powers of the Company to allot shares in the Company,
and to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in
the Company up to an aggregate nominal amount representing 20 per cent. of the
number of shares in the capital of the Company as at the date of the adoption
of these Articles and after consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the transaction Agreement between, amongst others, Sorin S.P.A. and
Cyberonics, Inc. first dated 26 February 2015 (in addition to any authority to
allot that has not yet expired granted to the Board prior to the date of the
adoption of these Articles) for a period expiring (unless previously renewed,
varied or revoked by the Company in general meeting) on the date which is five
years from the date of the adoption of these Articles by the Company; and

 



 

(b) make an offer or agreement which would or might require shares to be
allotted, or rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares to be
granted, after expiry of the authority described in this Article 5.1 and the
Board may allot shares and grant rights in pursuance of that offer or
agreement as if this authority had not expired.

 



 

5.2 Subject to these Articles, the Board shall be generally empowered pursuant
to section 570 of the Companies Act and section 573 of the Companies Act to
allot equity securities (as defined in the Companies Act) for cash, pursuant
to the authority conferred by Article 5 of these Articles as if section 561(1)
of the Companies Act did not apply to the allotment.

 



 

5.3 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act relating to the authority
to allot shares and the disapplication of pre-emption rights or otherwise and
of any resolution of the Company in general meeting passed pursuant to those
provisions, and, in the case of redeemable shares, the provisions of Article
5.4:

 



 

(a) all shares for the time being in the capital of the Company shall be at
the disposal of the Board; and

 



       
 

 



 

(b) the Board may reclassify, allot (with or without conferring a right of
renunciation), grant options over, or otherwise dispose of them to such
persons on such terms and conditions and at such times as it thinks fit.

 



 

5.4 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, and without prejudice to
any rights attached to existing shares, any share may be issued which is to be
redeemed, or is liable to be redeemed at the option of the Company or the
holder. The Board may determine the terms, conditions and manner of redemption
of any redeemable share so issued provided that it does so before the share is
allotted.

 



 

5.5 The Board may at any time after the allotment of a Share, but before a
Person has been entered in the register as the holder of the Share, recognise
a renunciation of the Share by the allottee in favour of another Person and
may grant to an allottee a right to effect a renunciation on such terms and
conditions as the Board thinks fit.

 



 

 **6.** ** ****VARIATION OF RIGHTS**

 



 

6.1 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, if at any time the capital
of the Company is divided into different classes of shares, all or any of the
rights attached to any existing class may from time to time be varied or
abrogated, either while the Company is a going concern or during or in
contemplation of a winding up:

 



 

(a) in such manner (if any) as may be provided by those rights;

 



 

(b) with the written consent of the holders of 75% in nominal value of the
issued shares of that class (excluding any shares of that class held as
treasury shares), which consent shall be in hard copy form or in electronic
form sent to such address (if any) for the time being specified by or on
behalf of the Company for that purpose, or in default of such specification to
the Office, and may consist of several documents, each executed or
authenticated in such manner as the Board may approve by or on behalf of one
or more holders, or a combination of both; or

 



 

(c) with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of
the holders of the shares of that class,

 



 

but not otherwise.

 



 

6.2 For the purposes of Article 6.1, if at any time the capital of the Company
is divided into different classes of shares, unless otherwise expressly
provided by the rights attached to any share or class of shares, those rights
shall be deemed not to be varied by:

 



 

(a) the issue of further shares ranking _pari passu_ with, or subsequent to,
that share or class of shares;

 



 

(b) the purchase or redemption by the Company of any of its own shares; and

 



 

(c) the exercise by the Board of any of the powers contemplated by Articles
38.7, 38.8 and 39.1.

 



 

 **7.** ** ****SHARE CERTIFICATES**

 



 

7.1 On becoming the holder of any share other than a share in uncertificated
form, every person (other than a financial institution in respect of whom the
Company is not required by law to complete and have ready a certificate) shall
be entitled, without payment, to have issued to him within two months after
allotment or lodgement of a transfer (unless the terms of issue of the shares
provide otherwise) one certificate for all the shares of each class held by
him (and,

 



      
 

 



 

upon transferring a part of his holding of shares of any class, to a
certificate for the balance of that holding). A holder may elect to receive
one or more additional certificates for any of his shares upon payment for
every certificate after the first of such reasonable sum as the Directors may
determine from time to time.

 



 

7.2 Every certificate shall:

 



 

(a) be issued under the seal, or under such other form of authentication as
the Board may approve (which may include manual or facsimile signatures by one
or more Directors); and

 



 

(b) shall specify the number, class and distinguishing numbers (if any) of the
shares to which it relates and the amount or respective amounts paid up on the
shares.

 



 

7.3 The Company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate for
shares held jointly by more than one person and delivery of a certificate to
one joint holder shall be sufficient delivery to all of them, and seniority
shall be determined in the manner described in Article 21.3. Shares of
different classes may not be included in the same certificate.

 



 

7.4 If a share certificate is damaged, defaced or worn out or said to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, it may be renewed on such terms (if any) as to evidence
and indemnity and payment of any exceptional out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Company in investigating evidence and preparing the requisite form of
indemnity as the Directors may determine but otherwise free of charge, and (in
the case of damage, defacement or wearing out) on delivery up of the old
certificate to the Company.

 



 

7.5 When a members holding of Shares of a particular class increases, the
Company may issue such holder with a single, consolidated certificate in
respect of all the Shares of a particular class which that member holds or a
separate certificate in respect of only those Shares by which that members
holding has increased. When a members holding of Shares of a particular class
is reduced, the Company must ensure that the member is issued with one or more
certificates in respect of the number of Shares held by the member after that
reduction, save that the Company need not (in the absence of a request from
the member) issue any new certificate if all the Shares which the member no
longer holds as a result of the reduction and none of the Shares which the
member retains following the reduction, were, immediately before the
reduction, represented by the same certificate.

 



 

 **8.** ** ****LIEN**

 



 

8.1 The Company shall have a first and paramount lien on every share (not
being a fully paid share) for all amounts payable to the Company (whether
presently or not) in respect of that share. The Board may at any time
(generally or in a particular case) waive any lien or declare any share to be
wholly or in part exempt from the provisions of Articles 8.1 to 8.4 inclusive.
The Companys lien on a share takes priority over any third partys interest
in that share and shall extend to all amounts (including without limitation
dividends) payable in respect of it.

 



 

8.2 The Company may sell, in such manner as the Board determines, any share on
which the Company has a lien if an amount in respect of which the lien exists
is presently payable and is not paid within 14 clear days after written notice
has been sent to the holder of the share, or to the person entitled to it in
consequence of the death or bankruptcy of the holder or otherwise by operation
of law, demanding payment and stating that if the notice is not complied with
the shares may be sold.

 



 

8.3 To give effect to the sale the Board may, in the case of a share in
certificated form, authorise any person to execute an instrument of transfer
of the share sold to, or in accordance with the directions of, the purchaser.
In the case of a share in uncertificated form, the Board may, to

 



      
 

 



 

enable the Company to deal with the share in accordance with the provisions of
this Article 8.3, exercise any of the powers of the Company under Article 4.7
to effect the sale of the share. The title of the transferee to the share
shall not be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings
in reference to the sale and the transferee shall not be bound to see to the
application of the purchase money.

 



 

8.4 The net proceeds of the sale, after payment of the costs, shall be applied
in or towards payment or satisfaction of so much of the amount for which the
lien exists as is presently payable, and any residue shall (upon surrender to
the Company for cancellation of the certificate for the share sold, in the
case of a share in certificated form, and, whether the share sold is in
certificated form or uncertificated form, subject to a like lien for any
amount not presently payable as existed upon the share before the sale) be
paid to the person entitled to the share at the date of the sale.

 



 

 **9.** ** ****CALLS ON SHARES**

 



 

9.1 Subject to the terms of allotment, the Board may from time to time make
calls upon the members in respect of any amounts unpaid on their shares
(whether in respect of nominal value or premium) and each member shall
(subject to receiving at least 14 clear days notice specifying when and where
payment is to be made) pay to the Company as required by the notice the amount
called on his shares. A call may be required or permitted to be paid by
instalments. A call may, by further notice in writing, before receipt by the
Company of an amount due under it, be revoked in whole or in part and payment
of a call may be postponed in whole or part. A person upon whom a call is made
shall remain liable for calls made upon him notwithstanding the subsequent
transfer of the shares in respect of which the call was made.

 



 

9.2 A call shall be deemed to have been made at the time when the resolution
of the Board authorising the call was passed.

 



 

9.3 The joint holders of a share shall be jointly and severally liable to pay
all calls in respect of it.

 



 

9.4 A call notice need not be issued in respect of sums which are specified,
in the terms on which a share is issued, as being payable to the Company in
respect of that share (whether in respect of nominal value or premium) on
allotment or on a date fixed by or in accordance with the terms of issue;
provided that if the due date for payment of such sum has passed and it has
not been paid, the holder of the share concerned at the due date for payment
will be treated in all respects as having failed to comply with a call notice
in respect of that sum and is liable to the same consequences as a person
having failed to comply with a call notice as regards the payment of interest
and forfeiture.

 



 

9.5 If a call or an instalment of a call remains unpaid in whole or in part
after it has become due and payable the person from whom it is due shall pay
interest on the amount unpaid from the day it became due and payable until it
is paid at the rate fixed by the terms of allotment of the shares in question
or in the notice of the call or, if no rate is fixed, the rate determined by
the Board, not exceeding 20 per cent. per annum, or, if higher, at the
appropriate rate (as defined by the Companies Act), but the Board may in
respect of any individual member waive payment of interest wholly or in part.

 



 

9.6 An amount payable in respect of a share on allotment or at any fixed date,
whether in respect of nominal value or premium or as an instalment of a call,
shall be deemed to be a call duly made and notified and payable on the date so
fixed or in accordance with the terms of the allotment. If it is not paid
these Articles shall apply as if that sum had become due and payable by virtue
of a call duly made and notified.

 



      
 

 



 

9.7 Subject to the terms of allotment, the Directors may on the issue of
shares differentiate between the allottees or holders in the amounts and times
of payment of calls on their shares.

 



 

9.8 The Board may, if it thinks fit, receive from any member willing to
advance it all or any part of the amount unpaid on any shares held by him
(beyond the sums actually called up) as a payment in advance of calls, and
such payment shall, to the extent of it, extinguish the liability on the
shares in respect of which it is advanced. The Company may pay on all or any
of the amount so advanced (until it would, but for such advance, become
presently payable) interest on the amount so received, or so much of it as
exceeds the sums called up on the shares in respect of which it has been
received, at such rate (if any) as the member and the Board agree not
exceeding 20 per cent. per annum or, if higher, the appropriate rate (as
defined in the Companies Act).

 



 

 **10.** ** ****FORFEITURE AND SURRENDER**

 



 

10.1 If a call or an instalment of a call remains unpaid, in whole or in part,
after it has become due and payable, the Board may give to the person from
whom it is due not less than 14 clear days written notice requiring payment
of the amount unpaid together with any interest which may have accrued and any
costs, charges and expenses incurred by the Company by reason of such non-
payment. The notice shall name the place where payment is to be made and shall
state that if the notice is not complied with the shares in respect of which
the call was made will be liable to be forfeited.

 



 

10.2 If the notice is not complied with, any share in respect of which it was
given may, at any time before the payment required by the notice has been
made, be forfeited by a resolution of the Board. The forfeiture shall include
all dividends and other amounts payable in respect of the forfeited shares and
which have not been paid before the forfeiture. When a share has been
forfeited, notice of the forfeiture shall be sent to the person who was the
holder of the share before the forfeiture. An entry shall be made promptly in
the register opposite the entry of the share showing that notice has been
sent, that the share has been forfeited and the date of forfeiture. No
forfeiture shall be invalidated by the omission or neglect to send that notice
or to make those entries.

 



 

10.3 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, a forfeited share shall
be deemed to belong to the Company and may be sold, re-allotted or otherwise
disposed of on such terms and in such manner as the Board determines either to
the person who was before the forfeiture the holder or to any other person. At
any time before sale, re-allotment or other disposition, the forfeiture may be
cancelled on such terms as the Board determines. Where for the purposes of its
disposal a forfeited share is to be transferred to any person, the Board may,
in the case of a share in certificated form, authorise someone to execute an
instrument of transfer and, in the case of a share in uncertificated form, the
Board may exercise any of the powers of the Company under Article 12\. The
Company may receive the consideration given for the share on its disposal and
register the transferee as the holder of the share.

 



 

10.4 A person shall cease to be a member in respect of any share which has
been forfeited or surrendered and shall, if the share is held in certificated
form, surrender to the Company for cancellation the certificate for the share
forfeited but shall remain liable to the Company for all amounts which at the
date of forfeiture were presently payable by him to the Company in respect of
that share plus interest at the rate at which interest was payable on those
amounts before the forfeiture or, if no interest was so payable, at the rate
determined by the Board, not exceeding 20 per cent. per annum or, if higher,
the appropriate rate (as defined in the Companies Act) from the date of
forfeiture until payment. The Board may waive payment wholly or in part or
enforce payment without any allowance for the value of the share at the time
of forfeiture or for any consideration received on its disposal.

 



      
 

 



 

10.5 The Board may accept the surrender of any share which it is in a position
to forfeit upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed and, subject to any
such terms and conditions, a surrendered share shall be treated as if it had
been forfeited.

 



 

10.6 The forfeiture of a share shall involve the extinction at the time of
forfeiture of all interest in and all claims and demands against the Company
in respect of the share and all other rights and liabilities incidental to the
share as between the person whose share is forfeited and the Company, except
only such of those rights and liabilities as are by these Articles expressly
saved, or are by the Companies Act given or imposed in the case of past
members.

 



 

10.7 A statutory declaration by a Director or the secretary that a share has
been duly forfeited on a specified date shall be conclusive evidence of the
facts stated in it as against all persons claiming to be entitled to the
share. The declaration shall (subject to the execution of an instrument of
transfer if necessary, in the case of a share in certificated form) constitute
a good title to the share. The person to whom the share is disposed of shall
not be bound to see to the application of the consideration, if any, nor shall
his title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or invalidity of the
proceedings relating to the forfeiture or disposal of the share.

 



 

 **11.** ** ****TRANSFER OF SHARES**

 



 

11.1 Without prejudice to any power of the Company to register as member a
person to whom the right to any share has been transmitted by operation of
law, the instrument of transfer of a share in certificated form may be in any
usual form or in any other form which the Board may approve. An instrument of
transfer shall be executed by or on behalf of the transferor and, where the
share is not fully paid, by or on behalf of the transferee. An instrument of
transfer need not be under seal.

 



 

11.2 The Board may, in its absolute discretion, refuse to register the
transfer of a share in certificated form if it is not fully paid provided that
the refusal does not prevent dealings in shares in the Company from taking
place on an open and proper basis.

 



 

11.3 The Board may, in its absolute discretion, also refuse to register the
transfer of a share:

 



 

(a) unless the instrument of transfer:

 



 

(i) is lodged, duly stamped, at the Office or such other place as the Board
has appointed, accompanied by the certificate for the share to which it
relates, or such other evidence as the Directors may reasonably require to
show the transferors right to make the transfer, or evidence of the right of
someone other than the transferor to make the transfer on the transferors
behalf;

 



 

(ii) is in respect of only one class of shares; or

 



 

(iii) is in favour of not more than four transferees; or

 



 

(b) is with respect to a share on which the Company has a lien and a sum in
respect of which the lien exists is presently payable and is not paid within
14 clear days after notice has been sent to the holder of the share in
accordance with Article 8.2.

 



 

11.4 If the Board refuses to register a transfer of a share, it shall as soon
as practicable and in any event within two months after the date on which the
instrument of transfer was lodged with the Company (in the case of a transfer
of a share in certificated form) send to the transferee notice of the refusal
together with reasons for the refusal. The Board shall send to the transferee
such further information about the reasons for the refusal as the transferee
may reasonably request.

 



      
 

 



 

11.5 No fee shall be charged for the registration of any instrument of
transfer or other document or instruction relating to or affecting the title
to any share.

 



 

11.6 The Company shall be entitled to retain any instrument of transfer which
is registered, but any instrument of transfer which the Board refuses to
register shall (except in the case of fraud) be returned to the person lodging
it when notice of the refusal is sent.

 



 

11.7 Nothing in these Articles shall preclude the Board from recognising a
renunciation of the allotment of any share by the allottee in favour of some
other person.

 



 

 **12.** ** ****TRANSMISSION OF SHARES**

 



 

12.1 If a member dies, the survivor or survivors where he was a joint holder,
or his personal representatives where he was a sole holder or the only
survivor of joint holders, shall be the only persons recognised by the Company
as having any title to his interest, but nothing in this Article 12.1 shall
release the estate of a deceased member from any liability in respect of any
share which had been solely or jointly held by him.

 



 

12.2 A person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or
bankruptcy of a member or otherwise by operation of law may, upon such
evidence being produced as the Board may properly require, elect either to
become the holder of the share or to have some person nominated by him
registered as the transferee. If he elects to become the holder he shall give
notice to the Company to that effect. If he elects to have another person
registered, and the share is a certificated share, he shall execute an
instrument of transfer of the share to that person. If he elects to have
himself or another person registered and the share is an uncertificated share,
he shall take any action the Board may require (including without limitation
the execution of any document) to enable himself or that person to be
registered as the holder of the share. All the provisions of these Articles
relating to the transfer of shares shall apply to the notice or instrument of
transfer as if it were an instrument of transfer signed by the member and the
death or bankruptcy of the member or other event giving rise to the
transmission had not occurred.

 



 

12.3 The Board may at any time send a notice requiring any such person
referred to in Article 12.2 to elect either to be registered himself or to
transfer the share. If the notice is not complied with within 60 days, the
Board may after the expiry of that period withhold payment of all dividends or
other amounts payable in respect of the share until the requirements of the
notice have been complied with.

 



 

12.4 A person becoming entitled to a share by reason of the death or
bankruptcy of a member or otherwise by operation of law shall, upon such
evidence being produced as the Board may reasonably require as to his
entitlement and subject otherwise to Article 12.2, have the same rights in
relation to the share to which he would be entitled if he were the holder of
the share, and may give a discharge for all dividends and other moneys payable
in respect of the share, except that he shall not, before being registered as
the holder of the share, be entitled in respect of it to receive notice of, or
to attend or vote at, any general meeting or at any separate meeting of the
holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company.

 



 

 **13.** ** ****SHARE WARRANTS**

 



 

13.1 The Company, with respect to fully paid shares, may issue share warrants
to bearer under the seal of the Company or in any other manner authorised by
the Board.

 



 

13.2 A share warrant shall state that the bearer is entitled to the shares
therein specified, and may provide by coupons or otherwise for the payment of
future dividends or other moneys on or in respect of the shares included in
such share warrant.

 



      
 

 



 

13.3 A share warrant shall entitle the bearer thereof to the shares included
in it, and the shares may be transferred by the delivery of the share warrant,
and the provisions of these Articles with respect to share certificates,
liens, calls on shares and forfeiture and surrender, disclosure of interest,
transfer of shares and transmission of shares shall not apply in relation to
share warrants or the holders thereof.

 



 

13.4 The Board shall be at liberty to accept a certificate (in such form and
from such person as the Board may approve) to the effect that a specified
person is shown in the records of the person issuing such certificate as being
entitled to the shares comprised in a specified share warrant as sufficient
evidence of the facts stated in such certificate, and may treat the deposit of
such certificate at the Office (or any other place specified from time to time
by the Board) as equivalent to the deposit there of the share warrant, and may
(inter alia) allot to the person named in such certificate any shares to which
the bearer of the share warrant referred to in such certificate may be
entitled and the rights of the allottee to the allotment shall not, after
allotment, be questioned by any person.

 



 

13.5 The Board may determine and from time to time vary the conditions upon
which share warrants shall be issued, and in particular (but without
limitation) upon which a new share warrant or coupon will be issued in the
place of one worn out, defaced, lost, stolen or destroyed (provided that no
new share warrant may be issued to replace one that has been lost or destroyed
unless the Board are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the original share
warrant has been lost, stolen or destroyed), upon which (subject as
hereinafter provided) the bearer of a share warrant shall be entitled to
attend and vote at general meetings, and upon which a share warrant may be
surrendered and the name of the holder entered in the register of members in
respect of the shares therein specified. Subject to such conditions and to
these Articles, the bearer of a share warrant shall be subject to the
conditions for the time being in force relating to share warrants, whether
made before or after the issue of such share warrant.

 



 

13.6 Subject to any conditions for the time being in force relating to share
warrants and as otherwise expressly provided in these Articles, the bearer of
a share warrant may at any time deposit the share warrant at the Office (or at
such other place as the Board may from time to time appoint) and, so long as
the share warrant remains so deposited, the depositor shall have the same
right of signing a requisition for calling a meeting of the Company, of giving
notice of intention to submit a resolution to a meeting and of attending and
voting, giving a proxy and exercising the other privileges of a member at any
meeting held after the expiration of 48 hours from the time of deposit, as if
his name were inserted in the register of members as the holder of the shares
included in the deposited share warrant. Not more than one person shall be
recognised as a depositor of any share warrant. Every share warrant which
shall have been so deposited as aforesaid shall remain so deposited until
after the closing of the meeting at which the depositor desires to attend or
to be represented.

 



 

13.7 Subject as otherwise expressly provided in these Articles or in any
conditions for the time being in force relating to share warrants, no person
shall, as bearer of a share warrant, be entitled to sign a requisition for
calling a meeting of the Company or give notice of intention to submit a
resolution to a meeting or attend or vote or give a proxy or exercise any
other privilege of a member at a meeting of the Company, or be entitled to
receive any notices or any documents pursuant to these Articles from the
Company, but the bearer of a share warrant shall be entitled in all other
respects to the same privileges and advantages as if he were named in the
register of members as the holder of the shares included in the share warrant,
and he shall be deemed to be a member of the Company.

 



 

13.8 Without prejudice to any powers which the Company or the Board may have
to issue, dispose of, convert, or otherwise deal with or make arrangements in
relation to, share warrants and other securities in any form:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) the holding of share warrants in uncertificated form and the transfer of
title to such share warrants shall be permitted; and

 



 

(b) the Company may issue share warrants in uncertificated form and may
convert share warrants from certificated form to uncertificated form and _vice
versa_. If and to the extent that any provision of these Articles is
inconsistent with such holding or transfer as is referred to in sub-paragraph
(a) of this Article 13.8, it shall not apply to any share warrant in
uncertificated form.

 



 

 **14.** ** ****UNTRACED MEMBERS**

 



 

14.1 The Company shall be entitled to sell any share held by a member, or any
share to which a person is entitled by transmission, if:

 



 

(a) during the period of 12 years before the date of the publication of the
advertisements referred to in paragraph (b) of this Article 14 (or, if
published on different dates, the first date) (the _relevant period_ ) at
least three dividends in respect of the share have been declared and all
dividend warrants, cheques or other method of payment for amounts payable in
respect of the share which have been sent and were payable in a manner
authorised by these Articles have remained uncashed;

 



 

(b) the Company has, as soon as practicable after the expiration of the
relevant period, inserted an advertisement in a leading national daily
newspaper published in the United Kingdom and in a newspaper circulating in
the area of the registered address or last known address of the member or
person concerned, giving notice of its intention to sell such share; and

 



 

(c) during the relevant period and the further period of three months after
the publication of the advertisements referred to in paragraph (b) of this
Article 14 (or, if published on different dates, the first date) the Company
has received no communication from, or on behalf of, such member or person
concerned.

 



 

14.2 The Company shall also be entitled to sell any additional share issued
during the relevant period of 12 years in right of any share to which Article
14.1 applies (or in right of any share so issued), if the criteria in Article
14.1 are satisfied in relation to the additional share (but as if the words
"during the period of 12 years" were omitted from paragraph (a) and the words
", after the expiration of the relevant period," were omitted from paragraph
(b)).

 



 

14.3 To give effect to the sale of any share pursuant to Articles 14.1 to 14.4
inclusive the Company may:

 



 

(a) in the case of a share in certificated form, appoint any person to execute
an instrument of transfer of the share, and the instrument shall be as
effective as if it had been executed by the registered holder of, or person
entitled by transmission to, the share; and

 



 

(b) in the case of a share in uncertificated form, the Directors may, to
enable the Company to deal with the share in accordance with the provisions of
Articles 14.1 to 14.4 inclusive, do all acts and things it considers necessary
and expedient to effect the transfer of the share to, or in accordance with
the directions of, the purchaser.

 



 

14.4 An instrument of transfer executed by that person in accordance with
Article 14.3(a) shall be as effective as if it had been executed by the holder
of, or person entitled by transmission to, the shares. An exercise by the
Company of its powers in accordance with Article 14.3(b) shall be as effective
as if exercised by the registered holder of or person entitled by transmission
to the shares. The purchaser shall not be bound to see to the application of
the proceeds of sale,

 



      
 

 



 

nor shall his title to the share be affected by any irregularity in or
invalidity of the proceedings relating to the sale. The net proceeds of sale
shall belong to the Company which shall be indebted to the member or other
person entitled to the share for an amount equal to the net proceeds of the
sale and the Company shall enter the name of such former member or other
person in the books of the Company as a creditor for that amount. No trust or
duty to account shall arise in respect of the net proceeds and no interest
shall be payable in respect of the proceeds of sale, which may be employed in
the business of the Company or invested in such investments as the Board may
think fit.

 



 

 **15.** ** ****ALTERATION OF CAPITAL**

 



 

15.1 Subject to the Companies Act and the provisions of these Articles, and
without prejudice to any relevant special rights attached to any class of
shares, the Company may from time to time:

 



 

(a) increase its share capital by allotting new shares;

 



 

(b) consolidate and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of
larger amount than its existing shares;

 



 

(c) sub-divide its shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount than
its existing shares;

 



 

(d) redeem and/ or cancel any of its shares;

 



 

(e) redenominate its share capital or any class of share capital; and

 



 

(f) determine that, as between the shares resulting from such a sub-division,
any of them may have any preference or advantage as compared with the others,

 



 

and where any difficulty arises in regard to any consolidation or division,
the Directors may settle such difficulty as they see fit.

 



 

15.2 Whenever any fractions arise as a result of a consolidation or sub-
division of shares, the Board may on behalf of the members deal with the
fractions as it thinks fit. In particular, without limitation, the Board may
sell shares, representing fractions to which any members would otherwise
become entitled, to any person (including, subject to the provisions of the
Companies Act, the Company) and distribute the net proceeds of sale in due
proportion among those members or retain such net proceeds for the benefit of
the Company. In the case of shares to be sold being held in certificated form,
the Board may authorise some person to execute an instrument of transfer of
the shares to, or in accordance with the directions of, the purchaser. In the
case of shares to be sold in uncertificated form, the Board may, to enable the
Company to deal with the share in accordance with the provisions of this
Article 15.2, do all acts and things it considers necessary or expedient to
effect the transfer of the shares to, or in accordance with the directions of,
the purchaser. The transferee shall not be bound to see to the application of
the purchase money nor shall his title to the shares be affected by any
irregularity in or invalidity of the proceedings in reference to the sale.

 



 

15.3 All shares created by an increase of the Companys share capital (unless
otherwise provided by the terms of allotment of the shares of that class), by
consolidation, division or sub-division of its share capital or the conversion
of stock into paid-up shares shall be subject to all the provisions of these
Articles, including without limitation provisions relating to the payment of
calls, lien, forfeiture, transfer and transmission.

 



       
 

 



 

15.4 The Company shall not consolidate, divide, sub-divide or redenominate any
one or more Ordinary Shares without consolidating, dividing, sub-dividing or
redenominating (as the case may be) all of the Ordinary Shares, on an equal
per share basis.

 



 

 **16.** ** ****GENERAL MEETINGS**

 



 

16.1 The Board shall convene and the Company shall hold general meetings as
annual general meetings in accordance with the Companies Act.

 



 

16.2 All provisions of these Articles relating to general meetings of the
Company shall, _mutatis mutandis_ , apply to every separate general meeting of
the holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, except that:

 



 

(a) the necessary quorum at any such meeting (or adjournment thereof) shall be
members of that class who together represent at least the majority of the
voting rights of all members of that class entitled to vote, present in person
or by proxy, at the relevant meeting; and

 



 

(b) each holder of shares of the class shall, on a poll, have one vote in
respect of every share of the class held by him.

 



 

For the purposes of this Article 16.2, where a person is present by proxy or
proxies, he is treated only as holding the shares in respect of which those
proxies are authorised to exercise voting rights with respect to any matter
proposed at the meeting.

 



 

16.3 The Board may call general meetings whenever and at such times and places
as it shall determine. On requisition of members pursuant to the provisions of
the Companies Act, the Board shall promptly convene a general meeting in
accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act. At a general meeting
called by a requisition (or by requisitionists), no business may be transacted
except that stated by the requisition or proposed by the Board.

 



 

16.4 A general meeting may also be called under this Article 16 if the Company
has fewer than two directors and the director (if any) is unable or unwilling
to appoint sufficient directors to make up a quorum or to call a general
meeting to do so. In such case, two or more members may call a general meeting
(or instruct the secretary to do so) for the purpose of appointing one or more
directors.

 



 

 **17.** ** ****NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETINGS**

 



 

17.1 At least 21 clear days notice must be given to call an annual general
meeting. Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, at least 14 clear
days notice must be given to call all other general meetings. A general
meeting may be called by shorter notice if it is so agreed by a majority in
number of the members having a right to attend and vote at the meeting, being
a majority who together hold not less than 95 per cent. in nominal value of
the shares giving that right.

 



 

17.2 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act and any relevant special
rights or restrictions attached to any shares, notices shall be given to every
member as of the record date for such meeting and to the Directors. The
beneficial owners nominated to enjoy information rights under the Companies
Act and the auditors of the Company are entitled to receive all notices of,
and other communications relating to, any general meeting which any member is
entitled to receive.

 



 

17.3 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the notice shall specify
the place (including without limitation any satellite meeting place arranged
for the purposes of Article 18.9, which shall be identified as such in the
notice), the date and the time of meeting and the general

 



      
 

 



 

nature of the business to be transacted, and in the case of an annual general
meeting shall specify the meeting as such. In the case of a meeting to pass a
special resolution, the notice shall specify the intention to propose the
resolution as a special resolution.

 



 

17.4 The notice of a general meeting must specify a time (which must not be
more than 48 hours, excluding any part of a day that is not a working day,
before the time fixed for the meeting) by which a person must be entered on
the register in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting.
Changes to entries on the register after the time specified in the notice will
be disregarded in deciding the rights of any person to attend or vote.

 



 

17.5 Where the Company has given an electronic address in any notice of
meeting, any document or information relating to proceedings at the meeting
may be sent by electronic means to that address, subject to any conditions or
limitations specified in the relevant notice of meeting.

 



 

17.6 The accidental omission to send notice of a meeting or resolution, or to
send any notification where required by the Companies Act or these Articles in
relation to the publication of a notice of meeting on a website, or to send a
form of proxy where required by the Companies Act or these Articles, to any
person entitled to receive it, or the non-receipt for any reason of any such
notice, resolution or notification or form of proxy by that person, whether or
not the Company is aware of such omission or non-receipt, shall not invalidate
the proceedings at that meeting.

 



 

 **18.** ** ****PROCEEDINGS AT GENERAL MEETINGS**

 



 

18.1 No business shall be transacted at a meeting unless a quorum is present
but the absence of a quorum shall not preclude the choice or appointment of a
chairman, which shall not be treated as part of the business of the meeting.
If the Company has only one member entitled to attend and vote at the general
meeting, one qualifying person present at the meeting and entitled to vote is
a quorum. Except as otherwise provided by these Articles, a quorum is the
members who together represent at least the majority of the voting rights of
all the members entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, at the
relevant meeting.

 



 

18.2 If a quorum is not present within half an hour after the time appointed
for holding the meeting (or such additional time as the chairman of the
meeting decides to wait), or if during a meeting a quorum ceases to be
present, the meeting, if convened on the requisition of members, shall be
dissolved, and in any other case shall stand adjourned. The continuation of a
general meeting adjourned under this Article 18.2 for lack of quorum shall
take place either:

 



 

(a) on a day that is not less than 14 days but not more than 28 days after it
was adjourned and at a time and/or place specified for the purpose in the
notice calling the meeting; or

 



 

(b) where no such arrangements have been specified, on a day that is not less
than 14 days but not more than 28 days after it was adjourned and at such time
and/or place as the chairman of the meeting decides (or, in default, the
directors decide).

 



 

In the case of a general meeting to take place in accordance with Article
18.2(b), the Company must give not less than seven clear days notice of any
adjourned meeting and the notice must state the quorum requirement.

 



 

18.3 At an adjourned meeting the quorum is one qualifying person present and
entitled to vote. If at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within
15 minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the meeting shall
be dissolved.

 



 

18.4 The chairman (if any) of the Board, or in his absence the deputy chairman
of the Board, or in the absence of both of them some other Director nominated
prior to the meeting by the Board, shall preside as chairman of the meeting.
If none of the chairman, deputy chairman or such

 



      
 

 



 

other Director (if any) is present within 15 minutes after the time appointed
for holding the meeting or is not willing to act as chairman, the Directors
present shall elect one of their number present and willing to act to be
chairman of the meeting, and if there is only one Director present, he shall
be chairman of the meeting.

 



 

18.5 If no Director is willing to act as chairman or if no Director is present
within 15 minutes after the time appointed for holding the meeting, the
members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall choose a
member present in person or a proxy of a member or a person authorised to act
as a representative of a corporation in relation to the meeting to be chairman
of the meeting.

 



 

18.6 The Board or the chairman of the meeting may make any arrangement and
impose any restriction they consider appropriate to ensure the security of a
general meeting, including to direct that any person wishing to attend any
general meeting should submit to such searches or other security arrangements
(including without limitation, requiring evidence of identity to be produced
before entering the meeting and placing restrictions on the items of personal
property which may be taken into the meeting) as they or he consider
appropriate under the circumstances. The Directors or the chairman of the
meeting may in their or his absolute discretion refuse entry to, or eject
from, any general meeting any person who refuses to submit to a search or
otherwise comply with such security arrangements or restrictions.

 



 

18.7 The Board or the chairman of the meeting may take such action, give such
direction or put in place such arrangements as they or he consider appropriate
to secure the safety of the people attending the meeting and to promote the
orderly conduct of the business of the meeting. Any decision of the chairman
of the meeting on matters of procedure or matters arising incidentally from
the business of the meeting, and any determination by the chairman of the
meeting as to whether a matter is of such a nature, shall be final.

 



 

18.8 Directors may attend and speak at general meetings and at any separate
meeting of the holders of any class of shares, whether or not they are
members. The chairman of the meeting may permit other persons who are not
members of the Company or otherwise entitled to exercise the rights of members
in relation to general meetings to attend and, at the chairman of the
meetings discretion, speak at a general meeting or at any separate class
meeting.

 



 

18.9 In the case of any general meeting, the Board may, notwithstanding the
specification in the notice convening the general meeting of the place at
which the chairman of the meeting shall preside (the **principal place** ),
make arrangements for simultaneous attendance and participation at satellite
meeting places, or by way of any other electronic means, allowing persons not
present together at the same place to attend, speak and vote at the meeting.
The arrangements for simultaneous attendance and participation at satellite
meeting places, or other places at which persons are participating via
electronic means may include arrangements for controlling or regulating the
level of attendance at any particular venue provided that such arrangements
shall operate so that all members and proxies wishing to attend the meeting
are able to attend at one or other of the venues. The members or proxies at
the satellite meeting places, or other places at which persons are
participating via electronic means, shall be counted in the quorum for, and be
entitled to vote at, the general meeting in question, and that meeting shall
be duly constituted and its proceedings valid if the chairman of the meeting
is satisfied that adequate facilities are available throughout the meeting to
ensure that the members or proxies attending at the satellite meeting places,
or other places at which persons are participating via electronic means, are
able to:

 



 

(a) participate in the business for which the meeting has been convened;

 



 

(b) see and hear all persons who speak (whether through the use of
microphones, loud speakers, audio-visual communication equipment or otherwise)
in the principal place and any other such place; and

 



      
 

 



 

(c) be heard and seen by all other persons so present in the same way.

 



 

18.10 The chairman of the general meeting shall be present at, and the meeting
shall be deemed to take place at, the principal place. If it appears to the
chairman of the meeting that the facilities at the principal place or any
satellite meeting place, have become inadequate for the purposes set out in
Article 18.9, then the chairman of the meeting may, without the consent of the
meeting, interrupt or adjourn the general meeting. All business conducted at
the general meeting up to the point of the adjournment shall be valid. The
provisions of Article 18.15 shall apply to that adjournment.

 



 

18.11 The Board may make arrangements for persons entitled to attend a general
meeting or an adjourned general meeting to be able to view and hear the
proceedings of the general meeting or adjourned general meeting and to speak
at the meeting (whether by the use of microphones, loudspeakers, audio-visual
communications equipment or otherwise) by attending at a venue anywhere in the
world not being a satellite meeting place. Those attending at any such venue
shall not be regarded as present at the general meeting or adjourned general
meeting and shall not be entitled to vote at the meeting at or from that
venue. The inability for any reason of any member present in person or by
proxy at such a venue to view or hear all or any of the proceedings of the
meeting or to speak at the meeting shall not in any way affect the validity of
the proceedings of the meeting.

 



 

18.12 The Board may from time to time make any arrangements for controlling
the level of attendance at any venue for which arrangements have been made
pursuant to Article 18.12 (including without limitation the issue of tickets
or the imposition of some other means of selection) it in its absolute
discretion considers appropriate, and may from time to time change those
arrangements. If a member, pursuant to those arrangements, is not entitled to
attend in person or by proxy at a particular venue, he shall be entitled to
attend in person or by proxy at any other venue for which arrangements have
been made pursuant to Article 18.9. The entitlement of any member to be
present at such venue in person or by proxy shall be subject to any
arrangement then in force and stated by the notice of meeting or adjourned
meeting to apply to the meeting.

 



 

18.13 If, after the sending of the notice of a general meeting but before the
meeting is held, or after the adjournment of a general meeting but before the
adjourned meeting is held (whether or not notice of the adjourned meeting is
required), the Board decides that it is impracticable or unreasonable, for a
reason beyond its control, to hold the meeting at the declared place (or any
of the declared places, in the case of a meeting to which Article 18.9
applies) and/or time, it may change the place (or any of the declared places,
in the case of a meeting to which Article 18.8 applies) and/or postpone the
time at which the meeting is to be held. If such a decision is made, the Board
may then change the place (or any of the declared places, in the case of a
meeting to which Article 18.8 applies) and/or postpone the time again if it
decides that it is reasonable to do so. In either case:

 



 

(a) no new notice of the meeting need be sent, but the Board shall, if
practicable, advertise the date, time and place of the meeting by public
announcement and in two newspapers with national circulation in the United
Kingdom and shall make arrangements for notices of the change of place and/or
postponement to appear at the original place and/or at the original time; and

 



 

(b) a proxy appointment in relation to the meeting may, if by means of a
document in hard copy form, be delivered to the Office or such other place
within the United Kingdom as may be specified by or on behalf of the Company
in accordance with Article 22.6(a) or, if in electronic form, be received at
the address (if any) specified by or on behalf of the Company in accordance
with Article 22.6(b).

 



      
 

 



 

18.14 For the purposes of Articles 18.9, 18.10, 18.11, 18.12 and 18.13, the
right of a member to participate in the business of any general meeting shall
include, without limitation, the right to speak, vote on a poll, be
represented by a proxy and have access to all documents which are required by
the Companies Act or these Articles to be made available at the meeting.

 



 

18.15 Without prejudice to any other power of adjournment he may have under
these Articles or at common law:

 



 

(a) the chairman of the meeting may, with the consent of a meeting at which a
quorum is present (and shall if so directed by the meeting), adjourn the
meeting from time to time and from place to place or for an indefinite period;
and

 



 

(b) the chairman of the meeting may, without the consent of the meeting,
adjourn the meeting before or after it has commenced, to another date, time or
place which the chairman of the meeting may decide, if the chairman of the
meeting considers that:

 



 

(i) there is not enough room for the number of members and proxies who wish to
attend the meeting;

 



 

(ii) the behaviour of anyone present prevents, or is likely to prevent, the
orderly conduct of the business of the meeting;

 



 

(iii) an adjournment is necessary to protect the safety of any person
attending the meeting; or

 



 

(iv) an adjournment is necessary to give all persons entitled to do so a
reasonable opportunity of speaking and voting at the meeting; or

 



 

(v) an adjournment is otherwise necessary in order for the business of the
meeting to be properly carried out.

 



 

18.16 Save in accordance with Article 18.2 an adjournment may, subject to the
provisions of the Companies Act, be for such time and to such other place (or,
in the case of a meeting held at a principal place and a satellite meeting
place, such other places) as the chairman may, in his absolute discretion
determine, notwithstanding that by reason of such adjournment some members may
be unable to be present at the adjourned meeting. Any such member may
nevertheless appoint a proxy for the adjourned meeting either in accordance
with Articles 22.2, 22.3 and 22.6 or by means of a document in hard copy form
which, if delivered at the meeting which is adjourned to the chairman or the
secretary or any Director, shall be valid even though it is given at less
notice than would otherwise be required by Article 22.6(a). Subject to the
provisions of the Companies Act, it shall not be necessary to give notice of
an adjourned meeting, except that when a meeting is adjourned for 28 days or
more, or for an indefinite period, at least seven clear days notice shall be
given specifying the time and place (or places, in the case of a meeting to
which Article 18.9 applies) of the adjourned meeting and the general nature of
the business to be transacted. No business shall be transacted at an adjourned
meeting other than business which might properly have been transacted at the
meeting had the adjournment not taken place. A resolution put to the vote of a
general meeting must be decided on a poll.

 



 

18.17 Subject to Article 18.18, a poll shall be taken as the chairman directs
and he may, and shall if required by the meeting, appoint scrutineers (who
need not be members) and fix a time and a place for declaring the result of
the poll. The result of the poll shall be deemed to be the resolution of the
meeting at which the poll was demanded.

 



      
 

 



 

18.18 A poll on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment
shall be taken immediately. A poll on any other question shall be taken at
either the meeting or such time and place as the chairman directs not being
more than 30 days after the meeting.

 



 

 **19.** ** ****AMENDMENTS TO RESOLUTIONS**

 



 

19.1 A special resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be amended
by ordinary resolution if: the chairman of the meeting proposes the amendment
at the general meeting at which the resolution is to be proposed; and

 



 

(a) the amendment does not go beyond what is necessary to correct a clear
error in the resolution.

 



 

19.2 An ordinary resolution to be proposed at a general meeting may be amended
by ordinary resolution if:

 



 

(a) written notice of the terms of the proposed amendment and of the intention
to move the amendment have been delivered in hard copy to the Company at the
Office or to such other place as may be specified by or on behalf of the
Company for that purpose, or received in electronic form at such address (if
any) for the time being specified by or on behalf of the Company for that
purpose, at least 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting or the
adjourned meeting at which the ordinary resolution in question is proposed
(which, if the Board so specifies, shall be calculated taking no account of
any part of a day that is not a working day) and the proposed amendment does
not, in the reasonable opinion of the chairman of the meeting, materially
alter the substance of the resolution; or

 



 

(b) the chairman of the meeting, in his absolute discretion, decides that the
proposed amendment may be considered or voted on.

 



 

19.3 With the consent of the chairman of the meeting, an amendment may be
withdrawn by its proposer before it is voted on. If an amendment proposed to
any resolution under consideration is ruled out of order by the chairman of
the meeting, the proceedings on the resolution shall not be invalidated by any
error in the ruling.

 



 

 **20.** ** ****PROPOSED MEMBER RESOLUTIONS**

 



 

20.1 Where a member or members, in accordance with the provisions of the
Companies Act, request the Company to (i) call a general meeting for the
purposes of bringing a resolution before the meeting, or (ii) give notice of a
resolution to be proposed at a general meeting, such request must, in each
case and in addition to the requirements of the Companies Act, contain the
following (and, to the extent that the request relates to the nomination of a
director, the content requirements of Article 24.3(b) also apply):

 



 

(a) to the extent that the request relates to the nomination of a director, as
to each person whom the member(s) propose(s) to nominate for election or re-
election as a director, all information relating to such person that is
required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be
made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or
is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the
Exchange Act including such persons written consent to being named in the
proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected (or re-
elected);

 



 

(b) to the extent that that request relates to any business other than the
nomination of a Director that the member(s) propose(s) to bring before the
meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the
meeting, the reasons for conducting

 



      
 

 



 

such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of
such member(s) and any Member Associated Person, individually or in the
aggregate, including any anticipated benefit to the member(s) or the Member
Associated Person therefrom; and

 



 

(c) as to the member(s) giving the notice and the Member Associated Person, if
any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made:

 



 

(i) the name and address of such member(s), as they appear on the Companys
books, and of such Member Associated Persons, if any;

 



 

(ii) the class and number of shares of the Company which are owned
beneficially and of record by such member(s) and such Member Associated
Persons, if any;

 



 

(iii) a description of all agreements, arrangements and understandings between
such member and such Member Associated Persons, if any, each proposed nominee
and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the
nomination of a Director or the proposal of any other business by such
member(s) or such Member Associated Person, if any;

 



 

(iv) any other information relating to such member or such beneficial owner
that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings
required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies pursuant to
Section 14 of the Exchange Act; and

 



 

(v) to the extent known by the member(s) giving the notice, the name and
address of any other member supporting the nominee for election or re-election
as a Director or the proposal of other business on the date of such request.

 



 

For the purposes of this Article 20.1, a **Member Associated Person** of any
member shall mean:

 



 

(A) any person controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with,
such member;

 



 

(B) any beneficial owner of shares in the capital of the Company owned of
record or beneficially by such member; and

 



 

(C) any person controlling, controlled by or under common control with such
Member Associated Person.

 



 

20.2 If a request made in accordance with Article 20.1 does not include the
information specified in that Article, or if a request made in accordance with
Article 20.1 is not received in the time and manner required by Article 20.3,
in respect of such shares which the relevant member(s) hold (the member
default shares) the relevant member(s) shall not be entitled to vote, either
personally or by proxy at a general meeting or at a separate meeting of the
holders of that class of shares (or at an adjournment of any such meeting),
the member default shares with respect to the matters detailed in the request
made in accordance with Article 20.1.

 



 

20.3 Without prejudice to the rights of any member under the Companies Act, a
member who makes a request to which Article 20.1 relates, must deliver any
such request in writing to the secretary at the Office not earlier than the
close of business on the one hundred and twentieth (120) calendar day nor
later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90) calendar day prior to
the date of the first anniversary of the preceding years annual general
meeting provided, however, that in the event that the date of an annual
general meeting is more than thirty (30)

 



      
 

 



 

calendar days before or more than sixty (60) calendar days after the date of
the first anniversary of the preceding years annual general meeting, notice
by the member must be so delivered in writing not earlier than the close of
business on the one hundred and twentieth (120) calendar day prior to such
annual general meeting and not later than the close of business on the later
of (i) the ninetieth (90) calendar day prior to such annual general meeting
and (ii) the 10 calendar day after the day on which public announcement of the
date of such annual general meeting is first made by the Company. In no event
shall any adjournment or postponement of an annual general meeting or the
public announcement thereof commence a new time period for the giving of a
members notice as described in this Article 20.3.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Article 20.3 to
the contrary, in the event that the number of Directors to be elected to the
Board is increased and there is no public announcement, naming all of the
nominees for Director or specifying the size of the increased Board, made by
the Company at least one hundred (100) calendar days prior to the date of the
first anniversary of the preceding years annual general meeting or, a
members notice required by this Article 20.3 shall also be considered as
validly delivered in accordance with this this Article 20.3, but only with
respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it
shall be delivered to the secretary at the Office not later than 5.00 pm,
local time, on the tenth (10) calendar day after the day on which such public
announcement is first made by the Company.

 



 

Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 20.1 or 20.2 or the foregoing
provisions of this Article 20.3, a member shall also comply with all
applicable requirements of the Companies Act and of the Exchange Act with
respect to the matters set forth in Articles 20.1 or 20.2 or in this Article
20.3. Nothing in Article 20.1 or 20.2 or in this Article 20.3 shall be deemed
to affect any rights of members to request inclusion of proposals in, nor the
right of the Company to omit proposals from, the Companys proxy statement
pursuant to Rule 14a-8 (or any successor provision) under the Exchange Act,
subject in each case to compliance with the Exchange Act.

 



 

 **21.** ** ****VOTES OF MEMBERS**

 



 

21.1 A resolution put to the vote of a general meeting must be taken on a
poll.

 



 

21.2 Subject to any relevant special rights or restrictions attached to any
shares (including, for the avoidance of doubt, such rights and restrictions
set out in Article 4.1 above), on a poll taken at a meeting, every qualifying
member present and entitled to vote on the resolution has one vote in respect
of each Ordinary Share.

 



 

21.3 In the case of joint holders the vote of the senior who tenders a vote
shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders,
and seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names of the
holders stand in the register of members.

 



 

21.4 A member in respect of whom an order has been made by any court or
official having jurisdiction (whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere) in
matters concerning mental disorder may vote by any person authorised in that
behalf by that court or official and such person may vote by proxy. Evidence
to the satisfaction of the Board of the authority of the person claiming the
right to vote shall be delivered to the Office, or such other place as is
specified in accordance with these Articles for the delivery or receipt of
appointments of proxy, not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for
holding the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the right to vote is to be
exercised (provided that the Company may specify, in any case, that in
calculating the period of 48 hours, no account shall be taken of any part of a
day that is not a working day). Failure to satisfy the requirements of this
Article 21.4 shall cause the right to vote not to be exercisable.

 



      
 

 



 

21.5 In the case of an equality of votes, the chairman of the meeting shall
not be entitled to a casting vote.

 



 

21.6 No member shall have the right to vote at any general meeting or at any
separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares, either in person or by
representative or proxy, in respect of any share held by him unless all
amounts presently payable by him in respect of that share have been paid.

 



 

21.7 If at any time the Board is satisfied that any member, or any other
person appearing to be interested in shares held by such member, has been duly
served with a notice under section 793 of the Companies Act (a **section 793
notice** ) and is in default for the prescribed period in supplying to the
Company the information thereby required, or, in purported compliance with
such a notice, has made a statement which is false or inadequate in a material
particular, then the Board may, in its absolute discretion at any time by
notice (a **direction notice** ) to such member direct that:

 



 

(a) in respect of the shares in relation to which the default occurred (the
**default shares** , which expression includes any shares issued after the
date of the section 793 notice in respect of those shares) the member shall
not be entitled to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a general
meeting or at a separate meeting of the holders of that class of shares or on
a poll; and

 



 

(b) in respect of the default shares:

 



 

(i) no payment shall be made by way of dividend and no share shall be allotted
or distributed pursuant to Articles 39.1, 40.1, and 40.2; and

 



 

(ii) no transfer of any default share shall be registered unless:

 



 

(A) the member is not himself in default as regards supplying the information
requested and the transfer when presented for registration is accompanied by a
certificate by the member in such form as the Board may in its absolute
discretion require to the effect that after due and careful enquiry the member
is satisfied that no person in default as regards supplying such information
is interested in any of the shares the subject of the transfer; or

 



 

(B) the transfer is an approved transfer.

 



 

21.8 The Company shall send the direction notice to each other person
appearing to be interested in the default shares, but the failure or omission
by the Company to do so shall not invalidate such notice.

 



 

21.9 Any direction notice shall cease to have effect not more than seven days
after the earlier of receipt by the Company of:

 



 

(a) a notice of an approved transfer, but only in relation to the shares
transferred; or

 



 

(b) all the information required by the relevant section 793 notice, in a form
satisfactory to the Board.

 



 

21.10 The Board may at any time send a notice cancelling a direction notice.

 



 

21.11 The Company may exercise any of its powers under Article 4.7 in respect
of any default share that is held in uncertificated form.

 



 

21.12 For the purposes of this Article 21.12 and Articles 21.7, 21.8, 21.9,
21.10 and 21.11:

 



       
 

 



 

(a) a person shall be treated as appearing to be interested in any shares if
the member holding such shares has sent to the Company a notification under
section 793 of the Companies Act which either:

 



 

(i) names such person as being so interested; or

 



 

(ii) fails to establish the identities of all those interested in the shares,
and (after taking into account the said notification and any other relevant
section 793 notification) the Company knows or has reasonable cause to believe
that the person in question is or may be interested in the shares;

 



 

(b) the prescribed period is 14 days from the date of service of the section
793 notice; and

 



 

(c) a transfer of shares is an approved transfer if:

 



 

(i) it is a transfer of shares pursuant to an acceptance of a takeover offer
(within the meaning of section 974 of the Companies Act);

 



 

(ii) the Board is satisfied that the transfer is made pursuant to a sale of
the whole of the beneficial ownership of the shares the subject of the
transfer to a party unconnected with the member and with any other person
appearing to be interested in the shares; or

 



 

(iii) the transfer results from a sale made through a recognised investment
exchange as defined in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 or any
other stock exchange outside the United Kingdom on which the Companys shares
are normally traded.

 



 

21.13 Nothing contained in Article 21.7, 21.8, 21.9, 21.10 and 21.11 limits
the power of the Company under section 794 of the Companies Act.

 



 

21.14 Any objection to the qualification of any person voting at a general
meeting or on a poll or to the counting of, or failure to count, any vote,
must be made at the meeting or adjourned meeting or at the time the poll is
taken (if not taken at the meeting or adjourned meeting) at which the vote
objected to is tendered. Every vote not disallowed at such meeting shall be
valid and every vote not counted which ought to have been counted shall be
disregarded. Any objection made in due time shall be referred to the chairman
of the meeting whose decision shall be final and conclusive. If a vote is not
disallowed by the chairman of the meeting it is valid for all purposes.

 



 

21.15 The Company shall not be bound to enquire whether any proxy or corporate
representative votes in accordance with the instructions given to him by the
member he represents and if a proxy or corporate representative does not vote
in accordance with the instructions of the member he represents the vote or
votes cast shall nevertheless be valid for all purposes.

 



 

21.16 If any votes are counted which ought not to have been counted, or might
have been rejected, the error shall not vitiate the result of the voting
unless it is pointed out at the same meeting, or any adjournment of the
meeting, and, in the opinion of the chairman, it is of sufficient magnitude to
vitiate the result of the voting.

 



 

 **22.** ** ****PROXIES AND CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES**

 



 

22.1 A member is entitled to appoint another person as his proxy to exercise
all or any of his rights to attend and to speak and vote at a meeting of the
Company in respect of the shares to which the proxy appointment relates. The
proxy appointment shall, unless it provides to the contrary,

 



      
 

 



 

be valid for any adjournment of the meeting as well as for the meeting to
which it relates. A proxy need not be a member.

 



 

22.2 The appointment of a proxy shall be:

 



 

(a) in the case of a proxy relating to shares in the capital of the Company
held in the name of a Depositary, in a form or manner of communication
approved by the Board, which may include, without limitation, a voter
instruction form to be provided to the Company by certain third parties on
behalf of the Depositary. Subject thereto, the appointment of a proxy may be:

 



 

(i) in hard copy form; or

 



 

(ii) in electronic form, to the electronic address provided by the Company for
this purpose; or

 



 

(b) in the case of a proxy relating to the shares to which Article 22.2(a)
does not apply:

 



 

(i) in any usual form or in any other form or manner of communication which
the Board may approve. Subject thereto, the appointment of a proxy may be:

 



 

(A) in hard copy form; or

 



 

(B) in electronic form, to the electronic address provided by the Company for
this purpose;

 



 

22.3 The appointment of a proxy, whether made in hard copy form or in
electronic form, shall be executed by or on behalf of the appointor in such
manner as the Directors may approve, which in the case of a corporation may be
either under its common seal or under the hand of a duly authorised officer or
other person duly authorised for that purpose or in any other manner
authorised by its constitution.

 



 

22.4 The Board may, if it thinks fit, but subject to the provisions of the
Companies Act, at the Companys expense (with or without provision for their
return prepaid) send hard copy forms of proxy for use at the meeting, or at
any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares, and issue
invitations in electronic form to appoint a proxy in relation to the meeting
in such form as may be approved by the Board. If, for the purpose of any
meeting appointments of proxy or invitations to appoint as proxy a person or
one of a number of persons specified in the invitations are issued at the
Companys expense, they shall be issued to all (and not to some only) of the
members entitled to be sent a notice of the meeting and to vote at it. The
accidental omission or the failure due to circumstances beyond the Companys
control, to send or make available such an appointment of proxy or give such
an invitation to, or the non-receipt thereof by, any member entitled to attend
and vote, at a meeting shall not invalidate the proceedings at that meeting.

 



 

22.5 The appointment of a proxy shall not preclude a member from attending and
voting in person at the meeting or poll concerned. A member may appoint more
than one proxy to attend on the same occasion, provided that each such proxy
is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares
held by that member. References in these Articles to an appointment of proxy
include references to an appointment of multiple proxies.

 



 

22.6 Without prejudice to Article 18.13(b) or the second sentence of Article
19.16, the appointment of a proxy shall:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) if in hard copy form, be delivered by hand or by post to the Office or
such other place within the United Kingdom as may be specified by or on behalf
of the Company for that purpose:

 



 

(i) in the notice convening the meeting; or

 



 

(ii) in any form of proxy sent by or on behalf of the Company in relation to
the meeting,

 



 

by the time specified by the Board (as the Board may determine, in compliance
with the provisions of the Companies Act) in any such notice or form of proxy;
and

 



 

(b) if in electronic form, be received at the electronic address to which the
appointment of a proxy may be sent by electronic means pursuant to a provision
of the Companies Act or to any other address specified by or on behalf of the
Company for the purpose of receiving the appointment of a proxy in electronic
form:

 



 

(i) in the notice convening the meeting;

 



 

(ii) in any form of proxy sent by or on behalf of the Company in relation to
the meeting;

 



 

(iii) in any invitation to appoint a proxy issued by the Company in relation
to the meeting; or

 



 

(iv) on a website that is maintained by or on behalf of the Company and
identifies the Company,

 



 

by the time specified by the Board (as the Board may determine, in compliance
with the provisions of the Companies Act) in any such method of notification.

 



 

The Board may specify, when determining the dates by which proxies are to be
lodged, that no account need be taken of any part of a day that is not a
working day.

 



 

22.7 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, where the appointment of
a proxy is expressed to have been or purports to have been sent or supplied by
a person on behalf of a holder:

 



 

(a) the Company may treat the appointment as sufficient evidence of that
persons authority to execute the appointment of proxy on behalf of that
member; and

 



 

(b) the holder shall, if requested by or on behalf of the Company at any time,
send or procure the sending of reasonable evidence of the authority under
which the appointment of proxy has been made, sent or supplied (which may
include, without limitation, a copy of such authority certified notarially or
in some other way approved by the Board), to such address and by such time as
may be specified in in the request and, if the request is not complied with in
any respect, the appointment of proxy may be treated as invalid.

 



 

22.8 Subject to Article 22.7, a proxy appointment which is not delivered or
received in accordance with Article 22.6 shall be invalid. Where two or more
valid appointments of proxy are delivered or received in respect of the same
share in relation to the same meeting, the one which was last delivered or
received shall, unless otherwise specified in the notice convening the
meeting, be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others as regards
that share. If the Company is unable to determine which is last delivered or
received, or if the Company determines that it has insufficient evidence to
decide whether or not a proxy appointment is in

 



      
 

 



 

respect of the same share, it shall be entitled determine which proxy
appointment (if any) is to be treated as valid. Subject to the Companies Act,
the Company may determine at its discretion when a proxy appointment shall be
treated as delivered or received for the purposes of these Articles.

 



 

22.9 The Company shall not be required to check that a proxy or corporate
representative votes in accordance with any instructions given by the member
by whom he is appointed. Any failure to vote as instructed shall not
invalidate the proceedings on the resolution.

 



 

22.10 Any corporation which is a member of the Company (the **grantor** ) may,
by resolution of its directors or other governing body, authorise such person
or persons as it thinks fit to act as its representative or representatives at
any meeting of the Company or at any separate meeting of the holders of any
class of shares. A Director, the secretary or other person authorised for the
purpose by the secretary may require all or any of such persons to produce a
certified copy of the resolution of authorisation before permitting him to
exercise his powers. Such person is entitled to exercise (on behalf of the
grantor) the same powers as the grantor could exercise if it were an
individual member of the Company. Where a grantor authorises more than one
person and more than one authorised person purports to exercise a power in
respect of the same shares:

 



 

(a) if they purport to exercise the power in the same way as each other, the
power is treated as exercised in that way; and

 



 

(b) if they do not purport to exercise the power in the same way as each
other, the power is treated as not exercised.

 



 

22.11 The termination of the authority of a person to act as a proxy or duly
authorised representative of a corporation does not affect:

 



 

(a) whether he counts in deciding whether there is a quorum at a meeting;

 



 

(b) the validity of anything he does as chairman of a meeting;

 



 

(c) the validity of a poll demanded by him at a meeting; or

 



 

(d) the validity of a vote given by that person,

 



 

unless notice of the termination was either delivered or received as mentioned
in the following sentence at least 24 hours before the start of the relevant
meeting or adjourned meeting or (in the case of a poll taken otherwise than on
the same day as the meeting or adjourned meeting) the time appointed for
taking the poll. Such notice of termination shall be either by means of a
document in hard copy form delivered to the Office or to such other place
within the United Kingdom as may be specified by or on behalf of the Company
in accordance with Article 22.6(a) or in electronic form received at the
address specified by or on behalf of the Company in accordance with Article
22.6(b), regardless of whether any relevant proxy appointment was effected in
hard copy form or in electronic form.

 



 

22.12 A proxy given in the form of a power of attorney or similar
authorisation granting power to a person to vote on behalf of a member at
forthcoming meetings in general shall not be treated as valid for a period of
more than three years, unless a contrary intention is stated in it.

 



 

 **23.** ** ****NUMBER AND CLASSIFICATION OF DIRECTORS**

 



 

23.1 Unless otherwise decided by the Board (where, for the period beginning on
the date of the unconditional adoption of these Articles and ending at the
first annual meeting of members of the Company following the completion of the
Companys second full fiscal year, such

 



      
 

 



 

decision must be taken unanimously), the number of directors shall be 9. The
composition of the Board (and, if applicable, each director) will satisfy the
requirements of applicable law and any securities exchange on which the
Companys securities are listed. Each director shall be able to understand and
speak English sufficiently to be able to participate fully in all meetings of
the Board.

 



 

23.2 The directors in office immediately following the unconditional adoption
of these Articles shall be appointed for a term that will expire at the first
annual meeting of members of the Company following the completion of the
Companys second full fiscal year.

 



 

 **24.** ** ****APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS**

 



 

24.1 Subject to the Articles, any person who is willing to act as a director,
and is permitted by law to do so, may be appointed to be a director:

 



 

(a) by ordinary resolution;

 



 

(b) at a general meeting called under article 16.4;

 



 

(c) by a decision of the directors.

 



 

24.2 Subject to the Companies Act, the directors may enter into an agreement
or arrangement with any director for the provision of any services outside the
scope of the ordinary duties of a director. Any such agreement or arrangement
may be made on such terms and conditions as (subject to the Act) the directors
think fit and (without prejudice to any other provision of the articles) they
may remunerate any such director for such services as they think fit.

 



 

24.3 No person shall be appointed a Director at any annual general meeting
unless:

 



 

(a) he is nominated by the Board; or

 



 

(b) notice in respect of that person is given by a member qualified to vote at
the meeting (other than the person to be proposed) has been received by the
Company in accordance with Article 20.1 and Article 20.3 or section 338 of the
Companies Act of the intention to nominate that person for appointment stating
the particulars which would, if he were so appointed, be required to be
included in the Companys register of directors, together with notice by that
person of his willingness to be appointed.

 



 

24.4 The directors may require that any notice of a proposed director by a
member include additional disclosure regarding such proposed director,
including such persons interest in the Company.

 



 

24.5 Except as otherwise authorised by the Companies Act, a motion for the
appointment of two or more persons as Directors by a single resolution shall
not be made unless a resolution that it should be so made has first been
agreed to by the meeting without any vote being given against it.

 



 

24.6 In the event that at a general meeting it is proposed to vote upon a
number of the resolutions for the appointment of a person as a Director (each
a **Director Resolution** ) that exceeds the total number of Directors that
are to be appointed to the Board at that meeting (the **Board Number** ), the
persons that shall be appointed Directors shall first be the person who
receives the greatest number of "for" votes (whether or not a majority of
those votes cast in respect of that Director Resolution), and then shall
second be the person who receives the second greatest number of "for" votes
(whether or not a majority of those votes cast in respect of that Director
Resolution), and so on, until the number of Directors so appointed equals the
Board Number.

 



      
 

 



 

24.7 Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the Company may by ordinary
resolution appoint a person who is willing to act as a Director, and is
permitted by law to do so, to be a Director, either to fill a vacancy or as an
additional Director. Any Director elected in accordance with this Article 24.7
shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors
in which the vacancy occurred or to which the new Director is appointed, until
his successor is appointed or until his earlier resignation or removal in
accordance with Article 30.1.

 



 

24.8 The Board may appoint a person who is willing to act as a Director and is
permitted by law to do so, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional
Director. Any Director elected in accordance with this Article 24.8 shall hold
office for the remainder of the full term of the class of Directors in which
the vacancy occurred or to which the new Director is appointed, until his
successor is appointed or until his earlier resignation or removal in
accordance with Article 30.1.

 



 

24.9 A Director shall not be required to hold any shares in the capital of the
Company by way of qualification.

 



 

24.10 All acts done by:

 



 

(a) a meeting of the directors;

 



 

(b) a meeting of a committee of the directors;

 



 

(c) written resolution of the directors; or

 



 

(d) a person acting as a director, or a committee,

 



 

shall be valid notwithstanding that it is discovered afterwards that there was
a defect in the appointment of a person or persons acting or that any of them
were disqualified from holding office, had ceased to hold office or were not
entitled to vote on the matter in question.

 



 

 **25.** ** ****DIRECTORS  FEES AND EXPENSES**

 



 

25.1 Unless otherwise determined by the Company by ordinary resolution, there
shall be paid to the Directors (other than alternate Directors and Directors
employed by the company in an executive capacity) such fees for their services
in the office of Director as the Directors may from time to time determine (or
as the Company may decide by ordinary resolution). The total fees will be
divided among the directors in the proportions that the Directors decide. If
no decision is made, the total fees will be divided equally. The fees shall be
deemed to accrue from day to day and shall be distinct from and additional to
any remuneration or other benefits which may be paid or provided to any
Director pursuant to any other provision of these Articles.

 



 

25.2 Subject to the Companies Act and the Articles, Directors fees may be
payable in any form and, in particular, the Directors may arrange for part of
a fee payable under this Article 25 to be provided in the form of fully paid
shares of the Company. The amount of the fee payable in this way is at the
Directors discretion. The amount of the fee will be applied to purchase or
subscribe for shares on behalf of the Director.

officer or employee of the Companys subsidiary undertakings or of any other
body corporate in which the Company is interested.

 



 

25.4 The Directors may also be paid all reasonable travelling, hotel and other

discharge of their duties as Directors.

 



 

25.5 Subject to the Act, the Directors may make arrangements to provide a

such expenditure.

 



 

25.6 Any Director who holds any executive office or who serves on any
committee of the Board or who performs services which the Board considers go
beyond the ordinary duties of a Director may be paid such special remuneration
(whether by way of bonus, commission, participation in profits or otherwise)
as the Board may determine.

directions given by special resolution to take or refrain from taking,
specified action, the business of the Company shall be managed by the Board
who may exercise all the powers of the Company, including without limitation
the power to dispose of all or any part of the undertaking of the Company. No
alteration of these Articles and no such direction shall invalidate any prior

by these Articles, and a meeting of the Board at which a quorum is present may

body corporate held or owned by the Company in such manner in all respects as
it thinks fit (including without limitation the exercise of that power in
favour of any resolution appointing its members or any of them as directors of

the provision of indemnification to the directors of such body corporate).

 



 

27.3 The Board may decide to make provision for the benefit of persons
employed or formerly employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other
than a Director or former Director or shadow Director) in connection with the
cessation or transfer to any person of the whole or part of the undertaking of
the Company or that Subsidiary.

 



 

27.4 The Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and
to mortgage or charge all or part of the undertaking, property and assets
(present or future) and uncalled capital of the Company and, subject to the

as collateral security for a debt, liability or obligation of the Company or
of a third party.

 



 

 **28.** ** ****COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ RULES**

 



 

28.1 For as long as the Ordinary Shares are listed on the NASDAQ, the Company
shall comply with all NASDAQ corporate governance standards set forth in
Section 3 of the NASDAQ Listed Company Manual applicable to non-controlled
domestic U.S. issuers, regardless of whether the Company is a foreign private
issuer.

 



 

 **29.** ** ****DELEGATION OF DIRECTORS  POWERS**

 



 

29.1 Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the Directors may delegate
any of the powers which are conferred on them under these Articles:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) to a committee consisting of one or more Directors and (if thought fit)
one or more other persons, to such an extent and on such terms and conditions
as the Board thinks fit; or

 



 

(b) to such person by such means (including by power of attorney), to such an
extent, and on such terms and conditions, as they think fit including
delegation to any Director holding any executive office such of its powers as
the Board considers desirable to be exercised by him.

 



 

Any such delegation shall, in the absence of express provision to the contrary
in the terms of delegation, be deemed to include authority to sub-delegate to
one or more Directors (whether or not acting as a committee) or to any
employee or agent of the Company all or any of the powers delegated and may be
made subject to such conditions as the Board may specify, and may be revoked
or altered.

designation or title including the word "director" or attach to any existing
office or employment with the Company such a designation or title and may
terminate any such appointment or the use of any such designation or title.
The inclusion of the word "director" in the designation or title of any such
office or employment shall not imply that the holder is a Director, and the
holder shall not thereby be empowered in any respect to act as, or be deemed
to be, a Director for any of the purposes of these Articles.

 



 

 **Committees**

 



 

29.4 Subject to Article 29.5, the proceedings of any committee appointed under

procedure for all or any committees, which prevail over rules derived from the
Articles.

30.1 A person ceases to be a Director if:

 



 

(a) the period expires, if he has been appointed for a fixed period;

the Board from meetings of the Board held during that period and the Board
resolves that he should cease to be a Director; or

 



 

(j) he dies.

 



 

30.2 A unanimous resolution of the directors (excluding the director the
subject of this Article) declaring a director to have ceased to be a director
under the terms of this Article is conclusive as to the fact and grounds of
cessation stated in the resolution.

 



 

30.3 If a director ceases to be a director for any reason, he shall cease to
be a member of any committee of the directors.

 



 

 **31.** ** ****EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS**

 



 

31.1 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Directors may appoint
one or more of their number to the office of chief executive or to any other
executive office of the Company (including, without limitation, to hold the
office of president and/or treasurer but excluding that of auditor) and any
such appointment may be made for such terms, at such remuneration and on such
other conditions as the Directors think fit. The Company may enter into an
agreement or arrangement with any such Director for his employment by the
Company or for the provision by him of any services outside the scope of the
ordinary duties of a Director. The Board may revoke or vary any such
appointment but without prejudice to any rights or claims which the person
whose appointment is revoked or varied may have against the Company because of
the revocation or variation.

 



 

31.2 Any appointment of a Director to an executive office shall terminate if
he ceases to be a Director but without prejudice to any rights or claims which
he may have against the Company by reason of that cessation. A Director
appointed to an executive office shall not cease to be a Director merely
because his appointment to such executive office terminates.

 



 

31.3 The emoluments of any Directors holding executive office for his services
shall be determined by the Board, and may be of any description, including
without limitation admission to, or continuance of, membership of any scheme
(including any share acquisition scheme) or fund instituted or established or
financed or contributed to by the Company for the provision of pensions, life
assurance or other benefits for employees or their dependants, or the payment
of a pension or other benefits to him or his dependants on or after retirement
or death, apart from membership of any such scheme or fund.

 



 

 **32.** ** ****DIRECTORS  INTERESTS**

 



 

32.1 For the purposes of these Articles (i) a conflict of interest includes
(x) a conflict of interest and duty and (y) a conflict of duties and (ii)
interest includes both direct and indirect interests.

 



      
 

 



 

32.2 A director shall be authorised for the purposes of section 175 of the Act
to act or continue to act as a director of the Company notwithstanding that at
the time of his appointment or subsequently he also holds office as a director
of, or holds any other office, employment or engagement with, any other member
of the Group.

 



 

32.3 For the purposes of section 175 of the Companies Act, the Board may
(subject to such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board may think fit to
impose from time to time, and always subject to the Boards right to vary or
terminate such authorisation) authorise, to the fullest extent permitted by
law:

 



 

(a) any matter proposed to it in accordance with these Articles which would,
if not so authorised, involve a breach of duty by a Director under that
section, including, without limitation, any matter which relates to a
situation in which a Director has, or can have, an interest which conflicts,
or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company or which may
reasonably be regarded as likely to give rise to a conflict of interest; and

 



 

(b) a Director to accept or continue in any office, employment or position in
addition to his office as a Director and, without prejudice to the generality
of Article 32.3(a), may authorise the manner in which a conflict of interest
arising out of such office, employment or position may be dealt with, either
before or at the time that such a conflict of interest arises,

 



 

provided that any such authorisation will be effective only if:

 



 

(i) any requirement as to quorum at the meeting at which the matter is
considered is met without counting the Director in question or any other
interested Director; and

 



 

(ii) the matter was agreed to without such Director voting or would have been
agreed to if such Directors votes had not been counted.

 



 

The Board may (whether at the time of the giving of the authorisation or
subsequently) make any such authorisation subject to any limits or conditions
it expressly imposes but such authorisation is otherwise given to the fullest
extent permitted. The Board may vary or terminate any such authorisation at
any time.

 



 

32.4 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, and provided that he has
disclosed to the Board the nature and extent of any material interest of his
(unless the circumstances referred to in section 177(5) or section 177(6) of
the Companies Act apply, in which case no disclosure is required), a Director
notwithstanding his office:

 



 

(a) may be a party to, or otherwise interested in, any transaction or
arrangement with the Company or in which the Company is otherwise (directly or
indirectly) interested;

 



 

(b) may (or any firm of which he is a member may) act in a professional
capacity for the Company (otherwise than as auditor) or any other body in
which the Company is otherwise interested and he or his firm shall be entitled
to remuneration for professional services as if he were not a Director; and

 



 

(c) may be a Director or other officer of, or employed by, or a party to any
transaction or arrangement with, or otherwise interested in, any undertaking:

 



 

(i) in which the Company is (directly or indirectly) interested as
shareholder, member, partner or otherwise; or

 



       
 

 



 

(ii) with which he has such a relationship at the request or direction of the
Company.

 



 

32.5 A Director shall not, by reason of his office, be accountable to the
Company for any remuneration or other benefit which he derives from any office
or employment or from any transaction or arrangement or from any interest in
any undertaking:

 



 

(a) the acceptance, entry into or existence of which has been authorised by
the Board pursuant to Article 32.2 (subject, in any case, to any limits or
conditions to which such authorisation was subject); or

 



 

(b) which he is permitted to hold or enter into by virtue of paragraphs (a),
(b) or (c) of Article 32.4,

 



 

nor shall the receipt of any such remuneration or other benefit constitute a
breach of his duty under section 176 of the Companies Act;

 



 

32.6 Any disclosure required by Article 32.4 may be made at a meeting of the
Board, by notice in writing or by general notice or otherwise in accordance
with section 177 of the Companies Act.

 



 

32.7 A Director shall be under no duty to the Company with respect to any
information which he obtains or has obtained otherwise than as a Director and
in respect of which he owes a duty of confidentiality to another person.
However, to the extent that his relationship with that other person gives rise
to a conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest, this Article 32.7
applies only if the existence of that relationship has been authorised by the
Board pursuant to Article 32.2. In particular, the Director shall not be in
breach of the general duties he owes to the Company by virtue of sections 171
to 177 of the Companies Act because he fails:

 



 

(a) to disclose any such information to the Board or to any Director or other
officer or employees of the Company; and/or

 



 

(b) to use or apply any such information in performing his duties as a
Director.

 



 

32.8 Where the existence of a Directors relationship with another person or
undertaking has been authorised by the Board pursuant to Article 32.2 and his
relationship with that person or undertaking gives rise to a conflict of
interest or possible conflict of interest, the Director shall not be in breach
of the general duties he owes to the Company by virtue of sections 171 to 177
of the Companies Act because he:

 



 

(a) absents himself from meetings of the Board at which any matter relating to
the conflict of interest or possible conflict of interest will or may be
discussed or from the discussion of any such matter at a meeting or otherwise;
and/or

 



 

(b) makes arrangements not to receive documents and information relating to
any matter which gives rise to the conflict of interest or possible conflict
of interest sent or supplied by the Company and/or for such documents and
information to be received and read by a professional adviser,

 



 

for so long as he reasonably believes such conflict of interest or possible
conflict of interest subsists, provided that provided that if a majority of
the Independent Directors of the Company so determine (excluding any
Independent Director who is conflicted in respect of the particular matter),
such conflicted director may be permitted to participate in the relevant
meeting (or part thereof), and to receive documents and information relating
to the matter, but not to vote (save to the extent that such participation or
access to such documents and information would constitute a breach of
applicable competition law or regulation.

 



      
 

 



 

32.9 The provisions of Articles 32.7 and 32.8 are without prejudice to any
equitable principle or rule of law which may excuse the Director from:

 



 

(a) disclosing information, in circumstances where disclosure would otherwise
be required under these Articles; or

 



 

(b) attending meetings or discussions or receiving documents and information
as referred to in Article 32.8, in circumstances where such attendance or
receiving such documents and information would otherwise be required under
these Articles.

 



 

32.10 For the purposes of Article 32.4:

 



 

(a) a general notice given to the Directors that a Director is to be regarded
as having an interest of the nature and extent specified in the notice in any
transaction or arrangement in which a specified person or class of persons is
interested shall be deemed to be a disclosure that the Director has an
interest in any such transaction of the nature and extent so specified;

 



 

(b) an interest of which a Director has no knowledge and of which it is
unreasonable to expect him to have knowledge shall not be treated as an
interest of his; and

 



 

(c) a Director shall be deemed to have disclosed the nature and extent of an
interest which consists of him being a Director, officer or employee of any
undertaking in which the Company is interested.

 



 

 **33.** ** ****PROCEEDINGS OF DIRECTORS**

 



 

33.1 Subject to the provisions of these Articles, the Board may regulate their
proceedings as they think fit.

 



 

33.2 A Director may, and the secretary at the request of a Director shall,
call a meeting of the Board or a committee of the Board by giving notice to
each Director. A notice of a meeting of the Board shall be deemed to be
properly given to a Director if given to him personally or by word of mouth,
or sent in hard copy to him at his last known address or any other address (if
any) as may for the time being be specified by him or on his behalf to the
Company for this purpose or sent in electronic form to such address (if any)
for the time being specified by him or on his behalf to the Company for this
purpose. Any Director may waive the requirement for notice of a meeting and
any such waiver may be retrospective. Any notice pursuant to this Article 33.2
need not be in writing if the Board so determines and any such determination
may be retrospective.

 



 

33.3 Questions arising at a meeting shall be decided by a majority of votes of
the Directors present at such meeting who are entitled to vote on such
question. A Director who is also an alternate Director shall be entitled in
the absence of his appointor to a separate vote on behalf of his appointor in
addition to his own vote, and an alternate Director who is appointed by two or
more Directors shall be entitled to a separate vote on behalf of each of his
appointors in the appointors absence.

 



 

33.4 No business shall be transacted at any meeting of the Board unless a
quorum is present. The quorum at a meeting of the Board shall be a majority of
the Directors then in office. Any Director who ceases to be a Director at a
Board meeting may continue to be present and to act as a Director and be
counted in the quorum until the termination of the Board meeting if no
Director objects. A Director shall not be counted in the quorum present in
relation to a matter or resolution on which he is not entitled to vote (or
when his vote cannot be counted) but shall be counted in the quorum present in
relation to all other matters or resolutions considered or

 



      
 

 



 

voted on at the meeting. An alternate Director, who is not himself a Director
shall, if his appointor is not present but is entitled to be counted in the
quorum, be counted in the quorum.

 



 

33.5 The Directors may at any time elect from their number, and remove, a
chairman of the Board and a deputy chairman. Unless he is unwilling to do so,
the Director appointed as chairman, or in his stead the Director appointed as
deputy chairman, shall preside at all meetings of the Board at which he is
present. If there is no Director holding either office, or if neither the
chairman nor the deputy chairman is present within five minutes after the time
appointed for the meeting, or if the chairman or deputy chairman is not
willing to preside, the Directors present may choose one of their number to be
chairman of the meeting.

 



 

33.6 All acts done by a meeting of the Board, or of a committee of the Board,
or by a person acting as a Director, shall, notwithstanding that it may
afterwards be discovered that there was a defect in the appointment of any
Director, any member of the committee or that any of them were disqualified
from holding office, or had vacated office, or were not entitled to vote, or
that the meeting was not quorate (provided that the Directors present at the
inquorate meeting believed, in good faith, that the meeting was quorate and
made all such enquiries as were reasonable in the circumstances to establish
that the meeting was quorate), be as valid as if every such person had been
duly appointed and was qualified and had continued to be a Director and had
been entitled to vote and that the meeting was quorate.

 



 

33.7 A resolution in writing agreed to by all the Directors entitled to
receive notice of a meeting of the Board or of a committee of the Board and
who would be entitled to vote (and whose vote would have been counted) on the
resolution at a meeting of the Board or of a committee of the Board shall (if
that number is sufficient to constitute a quorum) be as valid and effectual as
if it had been passed at a meeting of the Board or (as the case may be) of
that committee, duly convened and held. A resolution in writing is adopted
when the Company receives from all such Directors a document indicating their
agreement to the proposed resolution either by being signed or otherwise
authenticated in the manner permitted by the Companies Act for a document in
the relevant form, sent in either hard copy or electronic form (including
facsimile transmission) to such address (if any) for the time being specified
by the Company for that purpose. A resolution agreed to by an alternate
Director need not also be agreed to by his appointor and, if it is agreed to
by a Director who has appointed an alternate Director, it need not also be
agreed to by the alternate Director in that capacity.

 



 

33.8 Without prejudice to Article 33.1, a meeting of the Board or of a
committee of the Board may consist of a conference between Directors who are
not all in one place, but each of whom is able (whether directly or by
conference telephone or by any other form of communication equipment) to hear
each of the other participating Directors, and to speak to and be heard by
each of the others simultaneously. A Director taking part in such a conference
shall be deemed to be present in person at the meeting and shall be entitled
to vote and be counted in the quorum accordingly and the word "meeting" in
these Articles shall be construed accordingly. Such meeting shall be deemed to
take place where it is convened to be held or (if no Director is present in
that place) where the largest group of those participating is assembled, or,
if there is no such group, where the chairman of the meeting is located.

 



 

33.9 Except as otherwise provided by these Articles, a Director shall not vote
at a meeting of the Board or a committee of the Board on any resolution
concerning a matter in which he has, directly or indirectly, an interest
(other than an interest in shares, debentures or other securities of, or
otherwise in or through, the Company) which can reasonably be regarded as
likely to give rise to a conflict with the interests of the Company, unless
his interest arises only because the resolution falls within one or more of
the following matters:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) the giving of a guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of money lent
to, or an obligation incurred by him at the request of, or for the benefit of,
the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings;

 



 

(b) the giving of a guarantee, security or indemnity in respect of a debt or
obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings for which the
director has assumed responsibility (in whole or in part and whether alone or
jointly with others) under a guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of
security;

 



 

(c) the giving to him of any other indemnity which is on substantially the
same terms as indemnities given or to be given to all of the other directors
and/or to the funding by the Company of his expenditure on defending
proceedings or the doing by the Company of anything to enable him to avoid
incurring such expenditure where all other directors have been given or are to
be given substantially the same arrangements;

 



 

(d) a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning an offer of
shares, debentures or other securities of the Company or any of its subsidiary
undertakings for subscription, purchase or exchange, in which offer he is or
may be entitled to participate as holder of securities or in the underwriting
or sub-underwriting of which he is to participate;

 



 

(e) a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning any other
undertaking in which he or any person connected with him is interested,
directly or indirectly, and whether as an officer, shareholder, member,
partner, creditor or otherwise if he and any persons connected with him do not
to his knowledge hold an interest (as that term is used in sections 820 to 825
of the Companies Act) representing one per cent or more of either any class of
the equity share capital of such undertaking (or any other undertaking through
which his interest is derived) or of the voting rights available to
shareholders, members, partners or equivalent of the relevant undertaking (or
any interest being deemed for the purpose of this Article 33.9 to be likely to
give rise to a conflict with the interests of the Company in all
circumstances);

 



 

(f) a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal for the benefit of
employees and directors and/or former employees and directors of the Company
or any of its subsidiary undertakings and/or members of their families
(including a spouse or civil partner or a former spouse or former civil
partner) or any person who is or was dependent on such persons, including but
without being limited to a retirement benefits scheme and an employees share
scheme, which does not accord to any director any privilege or advantage not
generally accorded to the employees and/or former employees to whom such
arrangement relates; and

 



 

(g) a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning any insurance
against any liability which the Company is empowered to purchase or maintain
for, or for the benefit of, any Directors or for persons who include
Directors.

 



 

33.10 The Company may by ordinary resolution suspend or relax to any extent,
either generally or in respect of any particular matter, any provision of
these Articles prohibiting a Director from voting at a meeting of the
Directors or of a committee of the Directors or ratify any transaction not
duly authorised by reason of contravention of any such provision The Board may
suspend or relax to any extent, in respect of any particular matter, any
provision of these Articles prohibiting a Director from voting at a meeting of
the Directors or of a committee of the Directors.

 



 

33.11 Where proposals are under consideration concerning the appointment
(including without limitation fixing or varying the terms of appointment) of
two or more Directors to offices or

 



      
 

 



 

employments with the Company or any undertaking in which the Company is
interested, the proposals may be divided and considered in relation to each
Director separately In such cases each of the Directors concerned shall be
entitled to vote in respect of each resolution except that concerning his own
appointment.

 



 

33.12 If a question arises at a meeting of the Directors, or a meeting of a
committee of the Directors, as to the right of a Director to vote, the
question may, before the conclusion of the meeting, be decided by a resolution
of a majority of Directors present at the meeting (other than the Director
concerned and any other Director having a like interest as such Director) and
such resolution shall be final and conclusive.

 



 

 **34.** ** ****MINUTES**

 



 

34.1 The Directors shall cause minutes to be made in books kept for the
purpose:

 



 

(a) of all appointments of officers made by the Directors; and

 



 

(b) of all proceedings at meetings of the Company, of the holders of any class
of shares in the capital of the Company, and of the Board, and of committees
of the Board, including the names of the Directors present at each such
meeting.

 



 

34.2 Any such minutes, if purporting to be signed by the chairman of the
meeting to which they relate or of the meeting at which they are read, shall
be sufficient evidence without any further proof of the facts therein stated.

 



 

 **35.** ** ****SECRETARY**

 



 

Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the secretary shall be
appointed by the Board for such term, at such remuneration and on such other
conditions as they think fit. Any secretary so appointed may be removed by the
Board but without prejudice to any claim for damages for breach of any
contract of service between him and the Company.

 



 

 **36.** ** ****THE SEAL**

 



 

36.1 The seal shall be used only by the authority of a resolution of the Board
or of a committee of the Board. The Board may determine whether any instrument
to which the seal is affixed, shall be signed and, if it is to be signed, who
shall sign it. Unless otherwise determined by the Board:

 



 

(a) share certificates and, subject to the provisions of any instrument
constituting the same, certificates issued under the seal in respect of any
debentures or other securities, need not be signed and any signature may be
applied to any such certificate by any mechanical, electronic or other means
or may be printed on it; and

 



 

(b) every other instrument to which the seal is affixed shall be signed by two
authorised persons or by a Director in the presence of a witness who attests
the signature and for this purpose an authorised person is any Director or the
secretary of the Company.

 



 

36.2 Any document may be executed under the seal by impressing the seal by
mechanical means or by printing the seal or a facsimile of it on the document
or by applying the seal or a facsimile of it by any other means to the
document. A document executed, with the authority of a resolution of the
Board, in any manner permitted by section 44(2) of the Companies Act and
expressed (in whatever form of words) to be executed by the Company has the
same effect as if executed under the seal.

 



      
 

 



 

36.3 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company may have an
official seal for use in any place.

 



 

 **37.** ** ****REGISTERS**

 



 

37.1 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company may keep an
overseas or local register in any place, and the Board may make, amend and
revoke any regulations it thinks fit about the keeping of that register.

 



 

37.2 Any Director or the secretary or any other person appointed by the Board
for the purpose shall have power to authenticate and certify as true copies of
and extracts from:

 



 

(a) any document comprising or affecting the constitution of the Company,
whether in hard copy form or electronic form;

 



 

(b) any resolution passed by the Company, the holders of any class of shares
in the capital of the Company, the Board or any committee of the Board,
whether in hard copy form or electronic form; and

 



 

(c) any book, record and document relating to the business of the Company,
whether in hard copy form or electronic form (including without limitation the
accounts).

 



 

If certified in this way, a document purporting to be a copy of a resolution,
or the minutes or an extract from the minutes of a meeting of the Company, the
holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, the Board or a
committee of the Board, whether in hard copy form or electronic form, shall be
conclusive evidence in favour of all persons dealing with the Company in
reliance on it or them that the resolution was duly passed or that the minutes
are, or the extract from the minutes is, a true and accurate record of any
proceedings at a duly constituted meeting.

 



 

 **38.** ** ****DIVIDENDS**

 



 

38.1 The rights as regarding income attaching to the Ordinary Shares shall be
as set out in this Article.

 



 

38.2 Each Ordinary Share shall be entitled to receive all of the distributable
profits available and declared by the Directors for distribution by way of a
dividend amongst the holders of the Ordinary Shares. Each Ordinary Share shall
rank equally with all other Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company for
any dividend and shall receive its pro rata portion of any dividend rounded to
the nearest whole number (such rounding to be in the sole discretion of the
Board).

 



 

38.3 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company may by
ordinary resolution declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights
of the members, but no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the
Directors.

 



 

38.4 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act and to Article 38.8, the
Board may pay interim dividends, whether or not satisfied wholly or partly by
the distribution of assets including without limitation paid up shares or
debentures of another body corporate, of such amounts and on such dates and in
respect of such periods as they may think fit if it appears to them that they
are justified by the profits of the Company available for distribution If the
share capital is divided into different classes, the Board may:

 



 

(a) pay interim dividends on shares which confer deferred or non-preferred
rights with regard to dividend as well as on shares which confer preferential
rights with regard to

 



      
 

 



 

dividend, but no interim dividend shall be paid on shares carrying deferred or
non-preferred rights if at the time of payment, any preferential dividend is
in arrears; and

 



 

(b) pay at intervals settled by them any dividend payable at a fixed rate if
it appears to them that the profits available for distribution justify the
payment;

 



 

If the Board acts in good faith they shall not incur any liability to the
holders of shares conferring preferred rights for any loss they may suffer by
the lawful payment of an interim dividend on any shares having deferred or
non-preferred rights. Where any distribution is satisfied wholly or partly by
the distribution of assets, where any difficulty arises in regard to such
distribution, the Directors may settle the same as they think fit and in
particular (but without limitation) may issue fractional certificates (or
ignore fractions) and fix the value for distribution of any assets, and may
determine that cash shall be paid to any member on the basis of the value so
fixed in order to adjust the rights of members, and may vest any assets in
trustees.

 



 

38.5 Dividends may be declared and paid in any currency or currencies that the
Board shall determine. The Board may also determine the exchange rate and the
relevant date for determining the value of any dividend in any currency.

 



 

38.6 Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act and except as otherwise
provided by these Articles or the rights attached to shares, all dividends
shall be declared and paid according to the amounts paid up on the shares on
which the dividend is paid. If any share is issued on terms that it ranks for
dividend as from a particular date, it shall rank for dividend accordingly In
any other case (and except as aforesaid), dividends shall be apportioned and
paid proportionately to the amounts paid up on the shares during any portion
or portions of the period in respect of which the dividend is paid. For the
purpose of this Article 38.6, an amount paid up on a share in advance of a
call shall be treated, in relation to any dividend declared after the payment
but before the call, as not paid up on the share.

 



 

38.7 Subject to Article 38.8, a general meeting declaring a dividend may, upon
the recommendation of the Board, by ordinary resolution direct that it shall
be satisfied wholly or partly by the distribution of assets including without
limitation paid up shares or debentures of another body corporate. Where any
difficulty arises in regard to the distribution, the Directors may settle the
same as they think fit and in particular (but without limitation) may issue
fractional certificates (or ignore fractions) and fix the value for
distribution of any assets, and may determine that cash shall be paid to any
member on the basis of the value so fixed in order to adjust the rights of
members, and may vest any assets in trustees.

 



 

38.8 Unless otherwise recommended by two-thirds of the Board and approved by
an ordinary resolution of the Company, where the securities of another body
corporate are distributed, they must only be distributed to holders of
Ordinary Shares on the basis that the holders of Ordinary Shares receive the
identical class of securities on an equal per share basis.

 



 

38.9 Any dividend or other money payable in respect of a share may be paid:

 



 

(a) in cash;

 



 

(b) by cheque or warrant made payable to or to the order of the holder or
person entitled to payment;

 



 

(c) by direct debit, bank or other funds transfer system to the holder or
person entitled to payment or, if practicable, to a person designated by
notice to the Company by the holder or person entitled to payment; or

 



      
 

 



 

(d) by any other method approved by the Board and agreed (in such form as the
Company thinks appropriate) by the holder or person entitled to payment.

 



 

38.10 If two or more persons are registered as joint holders of any share, or
are entitled by transmission jointly to a share, the Company may:

 



 

(a) pay any dividend or other moneys payable in respect of the share to any
one of them and any one of them may give effectual receipt for the payment;
and

 



 

(b) for the purpose of Article 38.9, rely in relation to the share on the
written direction, designation or agreement of, or notice to the Company by,
any one of them.

 



 

38.11 A cheque or warrant may be sent by post:

 



 

(a) where a share is held by a sole holder, to the registered address of the
holder of the share;

 



 

(b) if two or more persons are the holders of the share, to the registered
address of the person who is first named in the register of members;

 



 

(c) if two or more persons are holders of the share or are jointly entitled to
it by reason of the death or bankruptcy of the holder or otherwise by
operation of law, as if it were a notice to be sent under Article 45.12; or

 



 

(d) in any case to such person and to such address as the person entitled to
payment may direct by notice to the Company.

 



 

38.12 Every cheque or warrant shall be made payable to the order of or to the
person or persons entitled or to such other person as the person or persons
entitled may by notice direct and payment of the cheque or warrant shall be a
good discharge to the Company. Every cheque or warrant sent or transfer of
funds made by the relevant bank or system in accordance with these Articles
shall be at the risk of the holder or person entitled. The Company shall have
no responsibility for any sums lost or delayed in the course of payment by any
method used by the Company in accordance with Article 38.9.

 



 

38.13 The Company may cease to send any cheque or warrant (or to use any other
method of payment) for any dividend payable in respect of a share if:

 



 

(a) in respect of at least two consecutive dividends payable on that share the
cheque or warrant has been returned undelivered or remains uncashed (or that
other method of payment has failed); or

 



 

(b) following one such occasion, reasonable enquiries have failed to establish
any new address of the holder;

 



 

but, subject to the provisions of these Articles, shall recommence sending
cheques or warrants (or using another method of payment) for dividends payable
on that share if the person or persons entitled so request and have supplied
in writing a new address or account to be used for that purpose.

 



 

38.14 The Board may deduct from any dividend or other moneys payable to any
member in respect of a share any moneys presently payable by him to the
Company in respect of that share. Where a person is entitled by transmission
to a share, the Board may retain any dividend payable in respect of that share
until that person (or that persons transferee) becomes the holder of that
share.

 



      
 

 



 

38.15 No dividend or other money payable in respect of a share shall bear
interest against the Company, unless otherwise provided by the rights attached
to the share.

 



 

38.16 Any dividend which has remained unclaimed for 12 years from the date
when it became due for payment shall, if the Directors so resolve, be
forfeited and cease to remain owing by the Company. The payment of any
unclaimed dividend or other money payable in respect of a share may (but need
not) be paid by the Company into an account separate from the Companys own
account. Such payment shall not constitute the Company a trustee in respect of
it.

 



 

 **39.** ** ****SCRIP DIVIDENDS**

 



 

39.1 The Board may offer any holder of shares the right to elect to receive
shares, credited as fully paid, instead of cash in respect of the whole (or
some part, to be determined by the Board) of all or any dividend subject to
the following terms and conditions:

 



 

(a) Each holder of shares shall be entitled to that number of new shares as
are together as nearly as possible equal in value to (but not greater than)
the cash amount (disregarding any tax credit) of the dividend that such holder
would have received by way of dividend but elects to forego (each a new
share). For this purpose, the value of each new share shall be:

 



 

(i) equal to the average quotation for the relevant shares in the capital of
the Company, that is, the average of the closing prices for those shares on
the NASDAQ or other exchange or quotation service on which the Companys
shares are listed or quoted as derived from such source as the Board may deem
appropriate, on the day on which such shares are first quoted ex the relevant
dividend and the four subsequent business days; or

 



 

(ii) calculated in any other manner the Board considers fit;

 



 

but shall never be less than the par value of the new share. A certificate or
report by the auditors as to the value of a new share in respect of any
dividend shall be conclusive evidence of that value.

 



 

(b) Each holder of shares shall only be entitled to new Ordinary Shares.

 



 

(c) On or as soon as possible after announcing that any dividend is to be
declared or recommended, the Board, if it intends to offer an election in
respect of that dividend, shall also announce that intention. If, after
determining the basis of allotment, the Board decides to proceed with the
offer, it shall notify the holders of shares of the terms and conditions of
the right of election offered to them, specifying the procedure to be followed
and place at which, and the latest time by which, elections or notices
amending or terminating existing elections must be delivered in order to be
effective.

 



 

(d) The Board shall not proceed with any election unless the Board has
sufficient authority to allot shares and sufficient reserves or funds that may
be appropriated to give effect to it after the basis of allotment is
determined.

 



 

(e) The Board may exclude from any offer any holders of shares where the Board
believes the making of the offer to them would or might involve the
contravention of the laws of any territory or that for any other reason the
offer should not be made to them.

 



 

(f) The dividend (or that part of the dividend in respect of which a right of
election has been offered) shall not be payable in cash on shares in respect
of which an election

 



      
 

 



 

has been made (the elected ordinary shares) and instead such number of new
shares shall be allotted to each holder of elected ordinary shares as is
arrived at on the basis stated in paragraph (a) of this Article 39.1. For that
purpose the Board shall appropriate out of any amount for the time being
standing to the credit of any reserve or fund (including without limitation
the profit and loss account), whether or not it is available for distribution,
a sum equal to the aggregate nominal amount of the new shares to be allotted
and apply it in paying up in full the appropriate number of new shares for
allotment and distribution to each holder of elected shares as is arrived at
on the basis stated in paragraph (a) of this Article 39.1.

 



 

(g) The new shares when allotted shall rank _pari passu_ in all respects with
the fully paid shares of the same class then in issue except that they shall
not be entitled to participate in the relevant dividend in lieu of which they
were allotted.

 



 

(h) No fraction of a share shall be allotted. The Board may make such
provisions as it thinks fit for any fractional entitlements including without
limitation payment in cash to holders in respect of their fractional
entitlements, provision for the accrual, retention or accumulation of all or
part of the benefit of fractional entitlements to or by the Company or to or
by or on behalf of any holder or the application of any accrual, retention or
accumulation to the allotment of fully paid shares to any holder.

 



 

(i) The Board may do all acts and things it considers necessary or expedient
to give effect to the allotment and issue of any share pursuant to this
Article 39.1 or otherwise in connection with any offer made pursuant to this
Article 39.1 and may authorise any person, acting on behalf of the holders
concerned, to enter into an agreement with the Company providing for such
allotment or issue and incidental matters Any agreement made under such
authority shall be effective and binding on all concerned.

 



 

(j) The Board may, at its discretion, amend, suspend or terminate any offer
pursuant to the above.

 



 

 **40.** ** ****CAPITALISATION OF PROFITS**

 



 

40.1 The Board may, subject to the provisions of this Article 40.1, Article
40.2 and Article 40.3 inclusive, resolve to capitalise any undistributed
profits of the Company not required for paying any preferential dividend
(whether or not they are available for distribution) or any sum standing to
the credit of any reserve or fund of the Company (including without limitation
the Companys share premium account and capital redemption reserve, if any)
and:

 



 

(a) appropriate the sum resolved to be capitalised to the members or any class
of members on the record date specified in the relevant resolution who would
have been entitled to it if it were distributed by way of dividend and in
proportion to the nominal amounts of the shares (whether or not fully paid)
held by them respectively which would entitle them to participate in a
distribution of that sum if the shares were fully paid and the sum were then
distributable and were distributed by way of dividend;

 



 

(b) apply such sum on their behalf either in or towards paying up the amounts,
if any, for the time being unpaid on any shares held by them respectively, or
in paying up in full shares, debentures or other obligations of the Company of
a nominal amount equal to that sum but the share premium account, the capital
redemption reserve, and any profits which are not available for distribution
may, for the purposes of this Article 40.1, only be applied in paying up
shares to be allotted to members credited as fully paid;

 



       
 

 



 

(c) allot the shares, debentures or other obligations credited as fully paid
to those members or as they may direct, in those proportions, or partly in one
way and partly in the other;

 



 

(d) resolve that any shares so allotted to any member in respect of a holding
by him of any partly paid shares shall so long as such shares remain partly
paid rank for dividend only to the extent that the latter shares rank for
dividend;

 



 

(e) where shares or debentures become, or would otherwise become,
distributable under this Article 40.1 in fractions, make such provision as the
Board thinks fit for any fractional entitlements including without limitation
authorising their sale and transfer to any person, resolving that the
distribution be made as nearly as practicable in the correct proportion but
not exactly so, ignoring fractions altogether or resolving that cash payments
be made to any members in order to adjust the rights of all parties;

 



 

(f) authorise any person to enter on behalf of all the members concerned into
an agreement with the Company providing for either:

 



 

(i) the allotment to members respectively, credited as fully paid, of any
further shares, debentures or other obligations to which they are entitled
upon such capitalisation; or

 



 

(ii) the payment up by the Company on behalf of the members of the amounts, or
any part of the amounts, remaining unpaid on their existing shares by the
application of their respective proportions of the sums resolved to be
capitalised,

 



 

and any agreement made under such authority being binding on all such members,
and

 



 

(g) generally do all acts and things required to give effect to such
resolution as aforesaid.

 



 

40.2 In exercising its authority under Article 40.1, unless recommended by
two-thirds of the Board and approved by an ordinary resolution of the Company,
the Board may only resolve to capitalise any undistributed profits of the
Company not required for paying any preferential dividend (whether or not they
are available for distribution) or any sum standing to the credit of any
reserve or fund of the Company (including without limitation the Companys
share premium account and capital redemption reserve, if any) and to issue and
allot Ordinary Shares, as otherwise contemplated by Article 40.1, to holders
of Ordinary Shares on an equal per share basis.

 



 

40.3

 



 

(a) Where, pursuant to an employees share scheme (within the meaning of
section 1166 of the Companies Act) the Company has granted awards ("awards"
being options or other incentive awards, including, without limitation, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance stock units and
restricted stock awards) to subscribe for or with respect to shares on terms
which provide (inter aim) for adjustments to the subscription, exercise or
base price payable on the exercise of such award or to the number of shares to
be allotted upon the exercise, or with respect to, such award, in the event of
any increase or reduction in, or other reorganisation of, the Companys issued
share capital and an otherwise appropriate adjustment would result in the
subscription, exercise or base price for any share being less than its nominal
value, then, subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Directors
may, on the exercise of any of the awards concerned and payment of the
subscription, exercise or base price which would have applied had such
adjustment been made, capitalise any

 



      
 

 



 

such profits or other sum as is mentioned in Article 40.1 above (as if such
Article 40.1 did not make reference to Article 40.2) to the extent necessary
to pay up the unpaid balance of the nominal value of the shares which fall to
be allotted on the exercise of such awards and apply such amount in paying up
such balance and allot shares fully paid accordingly. The provisions of
Article 40.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to this Article 40.3 as if Article
40.1 did not make reference to Article 40.2.

 



 

(b) Where, pursuant to an employees share scheme (within the meaning of
section 1166 of the Companies Act) the Company has granted awards ("awards"
being options or other incentive awards, including, without limitation, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock units, performance stock units and
restricted stock awards) to subscribe for or with respect to shares, then,
subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Directors may, on the
grant, exercise or vesting of any of the awards concerned, capitalise any such
profits or other sum as is mentioned in Article 40.1 above (as if such Article
40.1 did not make reference to Article 40.2) to the extent necessary to pay up
the unpaid balance of the nominal value of the shares which fall to be
allotted on the grant, exercise or vesting of such awards and apply such
amount in paying up such balance and allot shares fully paid accordingly. The
provisions of Article 40.1 shall apply mutatis mutandis to this Article
40.3(b) as if Article 40.1 did not make reference to Article 40.2.

 



 

 **41.** ** ****RETURN OF CAPITAL**

 



 

41.1 The rights as regards return of capital attaching to the Ordinary Shares
shall be as set out in this Article.

 



 

41.2 On a return of capital on a liquidation, reduction of capital or
otherwise, the surplus assets of the Company available for distribution among
the members shall be applied in the same order of priority as applies in
respect of dividends and distributions set out in Article 38 (or as close
thereto as is possible).

 



 

 **42.** ** ****CHANGE OF THE COMPANY S NAME**

 



 

The Companys name may be changed by resolution of the Board.

 



 

 **43.** ** ****RECORD DATES**

 



 

43.1 Notwithstanding any other provision of these Articles, and subject to the
Companies Act, but without prejudice to any special rights attached to any
shares, the Company or the Directors may:

 



 

(a) fix any date as the record date for any dividend, distribution, allotment
or issue, which shall not be more than 60 days prior to such action;

 



 

(b) for the purpose of determining which persons are entitled to attend and
vote at a general meeting of the Company, or a separate general meeting of the
holders of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, and how many
votes such persons may cast, specify in the notice of meeting a time by which
a person must be entered on the register in order to have the right to attend
or vote at the meeting provided that such time shall not be more than 60 days
nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting and changes to the
register after the time specified by virtue of this Article 43.1 shall be
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the
meeting; and

 



 

(c) for the purposes of sending notices to any one or more members (including,
without limitation, notices of general meetings, or separate general meetings
of the holders of

 



      
 

 



 

any class of shares in the capital of the Company), give such notices by
reference to the register of members as it stands at the close of business on
a day determined by the Company or the Board, which day may not be more than
60 days before the day that such notices are sent.

 



 

43.2 In the case of determination of members entitled to vote at any general
meeting or adjournment thereof, or a separate general meeting of the holders
of any class of shares in the capital of the Company, the record date shall,
unless otherwise required by the Companies Act, not be more than 60 days nor
less than 10 days before the date of such meeting.

 



 

43.3 In the case of any other lawful action, and save as otherwise provided by
these Articles, the record date shall not be more than 60 days prior to such
other action.

 



 

 **44.** ** ****ACCOUNTS**

inspect any accounting record or other document of the Company, unless he is
authorised to do so by statute, by order of the court, by the Board or by
ordinary resolution of the Company.

 



 

44.2 Subject to the Companies Act, a copy of the Companys annual accounts and
reports for that financial year shall, at least 21 clear days before the date
of the meeting at which copies of those documents are to be laid in accordance
with the provisions of the Companies Act, be sent to every member and to every
holder of the Companys debentures, and to every person who is entitled to
receive notice of meetings from the Company under the provisions of the
Companies Act or of these Articles or, in the case of joint holders of any
share or debenture, to one of the joint holders. A copy need not be sent to a
person for whom the Company does not have a current address.

 



 

44.3 Subject to the Companies Act, the requirements of Article 44.2 shall be
deemed satisfied in relation to any person by sending to the person, instead
of such copies, a summary financial statement derived from the Companys
annual accounts and directors report, which shall be in the form and
containing the information prescribed by the Companies Act and any regulations
made under the Companies Act.

 



 

 **45.** ** ****NOTICES AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS**

 



 

45.1 Any notice to be given to or by any person pursuant to these Articles
shall be in writing other than a notice calling a meeting of the Directors
which need not be in writing.

 



 

45.2 Any notice, document or information may (without prejudice to Articles
45.9 and 45.10) be given, sent or supplied by the Company to any member
either:

 



 

(a) personally;

 



 

(b) by sending it by post in a prepaid envelope addressed to the member at his
registered address or postal address given to the Company for that purpose, or
by leaving it at that address;

 



 

(c) subject to Article 45.3, by sending it in electronic form to a person who
has agreed (generally or specifically) that the notice, document or
information may be sent or supplied in that form (and has not revoked that
agreement); or

 



 

(d) subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, by making it available on
a website, provided that the requirements in (i) to (iv) below are satisfied.

 



 

The requirements referred to in paragraph (d) are that:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) the member has agreed (generally or specifically) that the notice,
document or information may be sent or supplied to him by being made available
on a website (and has not revoked that agreement), or the member has been
asked by the Company to agree that the Company may send or supply notices,
documents and information generally, or the notice, document or information in
question, to him by making it available on a website and the Company has not
received a response within the period of 28 days beginning on the date on
which the Companys request was sent and the member is therefore taken to have
so agreed (and has not revoked that agreement);

 



 

(ii) the member is sent a notification of the presence of the notice, document
or information on a website, the address of that website, the place on that
website where it may be accessed, and how it may be accessed ( **
_notification of availability_** ); and

 



 

(iii) in the case of a notice of meeting, the notification of availability
states that it concerns a notice of a company meeting, specifies the place,
time and date of the meeting, and states whether it will be an annual general
meeting, and

 



 

(iv) the notice, document or information continues to be published on that
website, in the case of a notice of meeting, throughout the period beginning
with the date of the notification of availability and ending with the
conclusion of the meeting and in all other cases throughout the period
specified by any applicable provision of the Companies Act, or, if no such
period is specified, throughout the period of 28 days beginning with the date
on which the notification of availability is sent to the member, save that if
the notice, document or information is made available for part only of that
period then failure to make it available throughout that period shall be
disregarded where such failure is wholly attributable to circumstances which
it would not be reasonable to have expected the Company to prevent or avoid.

 



 

45.3 The Board may from time to time issue, endorse or adopt terms and
conditions relating to the use of electronic means for the sending of notices,
other documents and proxy appointments by the Company to members or persons
entitled by transmission and by members or persons entitled by transmission to
the Company.

 



 

45.4 In the case of joint holders of a share:

 



 

(a) it shall be sufficient for all notices, documents and other information to
be given, sent or supplied to the joint holder whose name stands first in the
register of members in respect of the joint holding (first named **_holder_**
) only and any notice, document or other information so sent shall be deemed
for all purposes sent to all the joint holders; and

 



 

(b) the agreement of the first named holder that notices, documents and
information may be given, sent or supplied in electronic form or by being made
available on a website shall be binding on all the joint holders.

 



 

45.5 The Company may at any time and at its sole discretion choose to give,
send or supply notices, documents and information only in hard copy form to
some or all members.

 



 

45.6 For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Articles 45.1 to 45.5 are
subject to Article 17.6.

 



 

45.7 A member present either in person or by proxy, or in the case of a
corporate member by a duly authorised representative, at any meeting of the
Company or of the holders of any class

 



      
 

 



 

of shares shall be deemed to have received notice of the meeting and, where
requisite, of the purposes for which it was called.

 



 

45.8 Every person who becomes entitled to a share shall be bound by any notice
in respect of that share which, before his name is entered in the register of
members, has been given to the person from whom he derives his title, but this
Article 45.8 does not apply to a notice given under section 793 of the
Companies Act.

 



 

45.9 Subject to the Companies Act, where by reason of the suspension or
curtailment of postal services, the Company is unable effectively to give
notice of a general meeting, the general meeting may be convened by public
announcement. The Company shall send a copy of the notice to members in the
same manner as it sends notices under Articles 45.1 to 45.5 inclusive if at
least seven clear days before the meeting the posting of notices again becomes
practicable.

 



 

45.10 Subject to the Companies Act, any notice, document or information to be
given, sent or supplied by the Company to the members or any of them, not
being a notice to which Article 45.9 applies, shall be sufficiently given,
sent or supplied if given by public announcement.

 



 

45.11 Any notice, document or information given, sent or supplied by the
Company to the members or any of them:

 



 

(a) by hand shall be deemed to have been received by the member when it is
handed to the member or left at his registered address;

 



 

(b) by post, shall be deemed to have been received 24 hours after the time at
which the envelope containing the notice, document or information was posted
unless it was sent by second class post or there is only one class of post, or
it was sent by air mail to an address outside the United Kingdom, in which
case it shall be deemed to have been received 48 hours after it was posted
Proof that the envelope was properly addressed, prepaid and posted shall be
conclusive evidence that the notice, document or information was sent or
supplied;

 



 

(c) by advertisement, shall be deemed to have been received on the day on
which the advertisement appears;

electronic address provided by the member for the purpose of receiving
communications from the Company shall be conclusive evidence that the notice,
document or information was sent or supplied and such notice, document or
information shall be deemed received by the member at that time
notwithstanding that the Company becomes aware that the member has filed to
receive the relevant notice, document or information for any reason and
notwithstanding that the Company subsequently sends or supplies a hard copy of
such document or information by post to the member;

 



 

(e) by making it available on a website, shall be deemed to have been received
on the date on which the notice, document or information was first made
available on the website or, if later, when the member is deemed to have been
received notification of the fact that the notice, document or information was
available on the website in accordance with this Article 45.11 and such
notice, document or information shall be deemed received by the member on that
day notwithstanding that the Company becomes aware that the member has filed

information for any reason and notwithstanding that the Company subsequently
sends a hard copy of such notice, document or information by post to the
member, or

after the Company, or person acting on the Companys behalf, gives the notice,
document or information to the Depositary.

 



 

45.12 Any notice, document or information may be given, sent or supplied by
the Company to the person entitled to a share in consequence of the death or
bankruptcy of a member or otherwise by operation of law by sending or
delivering it in any manner that the Company may choose authorised by these

addressed to that person by name, or by the title of representative of the
deceased or trustee of the bankrupt or by any similar description, at the

notice, document or information until he has supplied to the Company (or its
agent) a new registered address or a postal address, or shall have informed
the Company, in such a manner as may be specified by the Company, of an

notices, documents or information include references to a cheque or other
instrument of payment, but nothing in this Article 45.13 entitles the Company
to cease sending any cheque or other instrument of payment for any dividend,
unless it is otherwise so entitled under these Articles. Without prejudice to
the generality of the foregoing, any notice of a general meeting of the
Company which is in fact sent or purports to be sent to such member shall be
ignored for the purpose of determining the validity of the proceedings at such
general meeting.

member or any other person, if the document is in electronic form, then in
order to be valid the document must either:

(which may be details previously allocated by the Company), of that member or
other person, in such form as the Directors may approve; or

information relating to a meeting, an instrument of proxy or invitation to
appoint a proxy, any validation requirements shall be specified in the
relevant notice of meeting in accordance with Articles 17.5 and 22.6(b).
