8 ARTICLE II

THE MERGER

Section 2.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
and limitations of this Agreement, at the Effective Time and in accordance
with Delaware Law, Sub shall be merged with and into the Company pursuant to
which (a) the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and (b) the
Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").

Section 2.2. _Closing; Effective Time_. 

(a) The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the
offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York
10153, at 10:00 a.m., eastern time, on the first Business Day following the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of all
conditions to the obligations of the parties set forth in Article VI hereof
(other than such conditions as may, by their terms, only be satisfied at the
Closing or on the Closing Date), or at such other place or at such other time
or on such other date as Acquiror and the Company mutually may agree. The day
on which the Closing takes place is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

(b) As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause a
certificate of merger to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in accordance with the
relevant provisions of Delaware Law. The Merger shall become effective upon
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such other time as the parties shall agree and as
shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time when the
Merger shall become effective is herein referred to as the " _Effective
Time_."

Section 2.3. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
provided for herein and in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective
Time, all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company and Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.4. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The certificate of
incorporation of Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. The by-laws of
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.

Section 2.5.  _Directors; Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, (a)
the directors of Sub serving immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be, in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation and (b) the officers of
the Company serving immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly appointed
and qualified, as the case may be, in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.6. _Subsequent Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or things are necessary
or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of either the Company or Sub acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of or in connection with
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name of and on behalf of either the Company or Sub, all such
deeds, bills of sale, assignments and  



 

9  assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of each of such
corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

Section 2.7. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any further action on the part of Acquiror, Sub, the
Company or any holder of any Shares or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

(a) _Capital Stock of Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Acquiror-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock that are owned by the Company
as treasury stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock owned by Acquiror or Sub, if any, shall be automatically canceled and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock_. Each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock (other than as set forth in Section 2.7(b) or Section 2.8) shall be
converted into the right to receive the consideration (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ") set forth on Exhibit C. At the Effective Time, all Shares
(including shares of treasury stock) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate
formerly representing any of such Shares (other than as set forth in Section
2.7(b) or Section 2.8) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.7(c).

Section 2.8. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company capital stock (other than any shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.7(b) hereof) outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has properly demanded appraisal
for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware Law ("
_Dissenting Shares_ "), if any, shall not be converted into or be exchangeable
for the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration unless and
until such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his right
to appraisal and payment under Delaware Law. If, after the Effective Time, any
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his right to appraisal,
such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the portion of
the Merger Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled in
accordance with Section 2.7 hereof, without interest. The Company shall give
Acquiror (i) prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares pursuant to Delaware Law and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Acquiror,
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, such demands.

Section 2.9. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. At the Closing, the Stockholder Representative
shall deliver to Acquiror each Certificate of each Stockholder representing
the Shares for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions provided by
Acquiror (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be required by
Acquiror) or an affidavit of any lost Certificate as contemplated in Section
2.9(c), if the Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed. The exchange
procedures shall comply with such procedures as may be required by the
Israeli Withholding Tax Pre-Ruling and shall permit Acquiror (after
consultation with the Company) to require holders of Certificates to provide
any information necessary to comply with the Israeli Withholding Tax Pre-
Ruling. The holder of each such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor (A) a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form)
representing that number of whole shares of Acquiror Common Stock that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II
after taking into  



 

10  account all the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
then held by such holder under all such Certificates so surrendered and (B)
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.9(c), and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a certificate (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form) representing the proper number of
shares of Acquiror Common Stock may be issued to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if, upon
delivery by the Stockholder Representative at the Closing, such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and the Person requesting such issuance shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the issuance of shares of Acquiror Common Stock to
a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Acquiror that such Tax either
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.9(a), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.9(c), in each
case, without interest.

(b) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All shares
of Acquiror Common Stock issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II (including any
cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.9(c)) shall
be deemed to have been issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock previously represented by such Certificates, and at the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock and Company
Preferred Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates that evidenced
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein
or by applicable Law.

(c) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender
for exchange of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ "), no
dividends or other distributions of Acquiror shall relate to such fractional
share interests and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner
thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of Acquiror. In lieu of
such fractional share interests, Acquiror shall pay to each holder of a
Certificate (upon surrender thereof as provided in this Article II) an amount
in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share
interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company
Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock held at the Effective Time by such
holder) would otherwise be entitled by (B) the Final Average Stock Price.

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Acquiror, the written agreement by such Person to indemnify
Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, Acquiror will issue, in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock to which such
holder would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.9(b), in each case pursuant to
this Agreement.

(e)  _No Liability_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any shares of Acquiror Common Stock (or
dividends or other distributions with respect thereto) or cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Acquiror Common Stock, in each case required to be
delivered and delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 



 

11 (f) _Withholding Taxes_. Acquiror shall be entitled to deduct and withhold or
cause to be deducted and withheld from the consideration otherwise payable to
a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock pursuant
to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any
provision of U.S. state, local, Israeli or foreign tax Law and in accordance
with the Israeli Withholding Tax Pre-Ruling (it being understood and agreed
that under applicable U.S. tax Law as of the date hereof, no withholding
would be required pursuant to this Section 2.9(f) in connection with amounts
payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock if such holder complies with applicable certification requirements by
providing Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or Form W-8BEN (or other
applicable form) and the Company provides to Acquiror the certificate
described in Section 6.3(o)). Acquiror shall not be entitled to withhold any
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.9(f) if Acquiror has received on or prior
to the Closing Date, such certificates or forms as are sufficient, under
applicable Law as of the Closing to establish that withholding is not
required; and Acquiror agrees that, before withholding and paying over any
amounts to any taxing authority with respect to a Stockholder pursuant to this
Section 2.9(f) (and delivering to such Stockholder the balance of the portion
of the Merger Consideration payable to such Stockholder pursuant to this
Agreement), Acquiror shall provide such Stockholder with written notice and
shall consult with such Stockholder in order to minimize the amount of any
such withholding. To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority, Acquiror shall be treated as though it withheld
or caused to be withheld from the type of consideration from which withholding
is required, an appropriate amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock in order to provide for such withholding obligation and such
withheld amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the former holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock. If withholding is required from shares of Acquiror
Common Stock, Acquiror shall be treated as having sold or caused to be sold
such consideration for an amount of cash equal to the fair market value of
such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and paid or caused to be
paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.

Section 2.10. _Company Stock Options; Company Warrants_.

(a) Before the Closing, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if
appropriate, any committee of the Board of Directors of the Company
administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take
such other actions as may be required to effect the following: 

(i) adjust the terms of all outstanding Options to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans or any other plans or
arrangements of the Company or its Subsidiaries (" _Company Stock Options_ "),
whether vested or unvested, as necessary to provide that, at the Effective
Time, each Company Stock Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be assumed and converted into an option to acquire, on
the same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Company Stock
Option or any other plans or arrangements of the Company or its Subsidiaries
the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option by the Exchange Ratio, at a price
for all the underlying shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (A) the
aggregate exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by (B) the Exchange
Ratio (each, as so converted, an " _Assumed Option_ "), and _provided_ that
such exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent, _provided,
further_ , that the terms and conditions with respect to the Assumed Options
of the Top Employees and Key Employees may vary but not the above formula for
calculating the number of Assumed Options; and

(ii) make such other changes to the Company Stock Plans as Acquiror and the
Company may agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger and the Israeli
Options Tax Ruling.

(b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need of any
further corporate action, Acquiror shall assume the Company Stock Plans, with
the result that all obligations of the Company under  



 

12  the Company Stock Plans, including with respect to Company Stock Options
outstanding at the Effective Time (converted pursuant to Section 2.10(a),
shall become the obligations of Acquiror following the Effective Time.

(c) Within three (3) Business Days, after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 (or another
appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock
equal to the number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock subject to the Assumed
Options. Such registration statement shall be kept effective (and the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses required thereby shall be maintained)
at least for so long as any Assumed Options or any unsettled awards
granted under the Company Stock Plans after the Effective Time may remain
outstanding.

(d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deliver
to the holders of Company Stock Options appropriate notices setting forth such
holders rights pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the agreements
evidencing the grants of such Company Stock Options after giving effect to
the Merger and the adjustments required by Section 2.10(a).

(e) Except as otherwise contemplated by Section 2.10 and except to the extent
required under the respective terms of the Company Stock Options, all
restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting with respect to Company
Stock Options awarded under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan,
program or arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to the
extent that such restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed,
shall remain in full force and effect with respect to such Company Stock
Options after giving effect to the Merger and the Israeli Options Tax Ruling.

(f) The Warrants and the agreements governing such Warrants shall be amended
and converted into the right to acquire upon exercise of the Warrants the
number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Warrant by the Exchange Ratio, at a price for all the
underlying shares of Acquiror Common Stock equal to (A) the aggregate exercise
price for the shares of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant
to such Warrant divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio, _provided_ that such
exercise price shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent and shall contain
cashless exercise provisions.

Section 2.11. _Stockholder Representative_.

(a) Each Stockholder, Vested Option Holder and Warrant Holder (collectively,
the " _Securityholders_ ") that has delivered a Stockholder Consent to the
Company or has executed the Consent and Indemnity Agreement shall be deemed
to have irrevocably appointed, authorized and directed Ron Hiram to act as the
Stockholder Representative, as such Securityholders agent, representative
proxy and attorney-in-fact and to exercise such rights, power and authority
granted herein to the Stockholder Representative on behalf of such
Securityholder insofar as it relates to indemnification claims under Article
VII, indemnification claims under the Consent and Indemnity Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement or otherwise expressly provided hereunder or thereunder, and
to exercise such rights, power and authority, as are incidental thereto
(including the right, power and authority to retain attorneys, accountants and
other advisors to assist the Stockholder Representative in the performance of
his or her duties hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement and the Consent and
Indemnity Agreement), with the ability to execute and deliver all instruments,
certificates and other documents of every kind incident to the foregoing and
with all right, power and authority to act on behalf of each such
Securityholder in connection therewith. Each of Acquiror and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to rely on, and shall be fully protected in
reliance on, any written document signed by the Stockholder Representative.

(b) The Stockholder Representative shall also be deemed to have such
incidental powers as may be necessary or desirable in order to effect the
provisions of this Section 2.11. The appointment and agency created hereby is
irrevocable, and shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest. All duly
authorized decisions, actions, consents and instructions by the Stockholder
Representative shall be binding upon all of such Securityholders, and no such
Securityholder shall have the right to object to, dissent from, protest
or otherwise contest the same. Acquiror and Sub shall be entitled to rely on
any decision, action, consent or  



 

13  instruction of the Stockholder Representative as being the decision, action,
consent or instruction of such Securityholders, and Acquiror and Sub are
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done by them in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction. Each of
Acquiror, Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby waive, and by their
approval of this Agreement, each such Securityholder shall be deemed to have
waived, any claims they may have or assert, including those (on its behalf and
on behalf of its Affiliates) that may arise in the future, against the
Stockholder Representative for, and agree that the Stockholder Representative
shall have no liability for, any action or inaction taken or not taken by the
Stockholder Representative exclusively in connection with such persons
capacity as the Stockholder Representative except to the extent that such
action or inaction shall have been held by a court of competent jurisdiction
to constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. Such Persons further
agree that in no event shall the Stockholder Representative be liable for any
negligent act or omission. The Stockholder Representative may consult with
legal counsel and may rely on, and shall be fully protected in reliance on,
any such advice of counsel.

(c) The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed
for any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of Stockholders
holding a majority of the Shares (on an as-converted basis) held by such
Stockholders immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Majority Holders_
"); _provided, however_ , that no such resignation or removal shall be
effective until a new Stockholder Representative, who shall be reasonably able
to perform the duties of the Stockholder Representative hereunder and
reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror has been appointed and such new
Stockholder Representative agrees in a writing delivered to Acquiror to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement that relate to
the Stockholder Representative. Subject to compliance with the foregoing
proviso, in the event of the death, incapacity, resignation or removal of the
Stockholder Representative, a new Stockholder Representative shall be
appointed by the vote or written consent of the Majority Holders. Notice of
such vote or a copy of the written consent appointing such new Stockholder
Representative shall be sent to Acquiror and, after the Effective Time, to the
Surviving Corporation, such appointment to be effective (subject to compliance
with the proviso in the first sentence of this Section 2.11(c)) upon the
later of the date indicated in such consent or the date such consent is
received by Acquiror and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative may resign
thirty (30) days after giving notice to the Majority Holders, whether or not
a replacement has been selected in accordance with the foregoing.

(d) The approval of this Agreement by the requisite vote or written consent of
Stockholders shall also be deemed to constitute approval of all arrangements
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and to the provisions hereof
and of the applicable Ancillary Agreements binding upon the Stockholders,
including Article VII hereof.

(e) The Stockholder Representative shall not be entitled to any fee,
commission or other compensation for the performance of his services
hereunder, but shall be entitled to the payment by the Company (and, after the
Closing, by the Surviving Corporation) of all of his reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the performance
of duties hereunder as the Stockholder Representative.

(f) Acquiror and Sub acknowledge and agree that the obligations of the
Stockholder Representative hereunder are obligations strictly in his capacity

afford Acquiror and its officers, employees, agents, accountants, advisors,
bankers, attorneys and other representatives (collectively, with respect to
the respective representatives of Acquiror and the Company, "
_Representatives_ ") reasonable access to the properties, offices and other
facilities, books and records of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries,
and shall furnish Acquiror with such financial, operating and other data and
information as Acquiror may reasonably request, including monthly updates and
access to personnel; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access or
furnishing of information shall be conducted at Acquirors expense, during

be directed to an executive officer of the Company.

Section 5.3. _Stockholder Consents_. The Company shall seek, as soon
as practicable, Stockholder Consents from each of the Stockholders (other

connection therewith, the Company shall (a) promptly prepare all necessary
materials relating to such consents, (b) use its best efforts to promptly
obtain such consents and (c) otherwise comply with all legal requirements
applicable to obtaining such consents. Without limitation of the foregoing,
the Company will cause the Information Statement (x) to comply with the

a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

Section 5.4. _Information Statement_. Promptly after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company will prepare, in consultation with Acquiror, an
information statement (the " _Information Statement_ ") which describes the

approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby has not

approval of this Agreement, the Merger, the Ancillary Agreements and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the Board of Directors of the
Company and (b) provides copies of the applicable dissenters rights statutes

distributed without Acquirors approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed; _provided_ , that Acquiror shall in no way be responsible
for any of the content of the Information Statement except as it pertains to
and has been supplied in writing by Acquiror for inclusion therein.

Section 5.5. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Until the consummation of the
Closing, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other parties in writing
of:

(a) any fact, change, condition, circumstance or occurrence or nonoccurrence
of any event of which it is aware that will or is reasonably likely to result
in any of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect as of the date of this Agreement
or as of the Closing Date or any of its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement not to be complied with or satisfied;

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Ancillary Agreements, each of the Company and Acquiror and their
respective Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions
as are reasonably  



 

40  necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or
thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such
statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

Section 5.7. _Negotiations_. From the date of this Agreement until the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will
not, and will not permit or authorize any of its officers, directors,
employees, lenders, investment banking firms, other agents, other
Representatives or Affiliates to, solicit, initiate or encourage or take any
other action to facilitate, any inquiries or proposals by, or engage in any
discussions or negotiations with, or furnish any nonpublic information to or
enter into any agreement with any Persons other than Acquiror and Sub
concerning the merger, consolidation, sale of securities or any other
transaction involving, directly or indirectly, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or all or a significant portion of their properties or assets or
any of their equity. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company
will notify Acquiror of any such inquiry or proposal promptly after receipt of
the same by the Companys officers, directors, employees or Affiliates
(whether received directly or through any lender, investment banking firm or
other agent).

Section 5.8. _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Acquiror shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor all
unused vacation, holiday, sickness and personal days accrued prior to the
consummation of the Closing by the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under the policies and practices of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided
to any employee of the Surviving Corporation who was an employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing, Acquiror
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, as applicable, (i) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and their covered
dependents, under such plan (except to the extent that such conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the corresponding Employee
Plan absent any such change) and (ii) provide each such employee and his or
her covered dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to any such change in coverage in satisfying any applicable deductible
or out-of-pocket requirements under such new or changed plan. Acquiror shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with credit for all service with the
Company and its Subsidiaries (and service credited by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries) prior to the Closing Date, to the extent recognized as
service under corresponding Employee Plans prior to the Closing Date, for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under and the calculation
of severance or vacation pay under all employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements maintained by or contributed to by Acquiror and its Subsidiaries
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation) in which such
employee becomes eligible to participate, except to the extent that
such service credit would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to
the same period of service.

(b) Nothing contained in this Section 5.8 shall be construed to create any
rights in any employee or former employee (including any dependent thereof) of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in
respect of continued employment for any specified period, nor to require
Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee
benefit plans.

Section 5.9.  _Confidentiality_. Each of Acquiror and the Company shall hold,
and shall cause its Representatives to hold in confidence, all documents and
information furnished to it by or on behalf of any other party to this
Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
the terms of that certain letter agreement entered into February 14, 2006 by
and between Acquiror and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time,
the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Sub agrees to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement as fully as if it were an original party thereto. If
for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing Date, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms.



 

41 Section 5.10. _Consents and Filings; Further Assurances_.

(a) Subject to the proviso contained in the first sentence of Section 5.10(b)
hereof, each of the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements as promptly as practicable, including executing
and taking all actions (including filing and recording of assignment
agreements and other documents with the United States Patent and Trademark
Office and/or the applicable foreign authorities) to confirm Companys
ownership of all Company Registered IP and by obtaining from Governmental
Authorities and other Persons all consents, approvals, authorizations,
qualifications and orders as are necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(b) Each of the Company and Acquiror shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement will require or
obligate Acquiror or Sub to (and in no event shall any representation,
warranty or covenant of Acquiror or Sub contained in this Agreement be
breached or deemed breached as a result of the failure of Acquiror or Sub to
take any of the following actions): (i) agree to or otherwise become subject
to any limitations on (A) the right of Acquiror or Surviving Corporation
effectively to control or operate their business or assets (except as may be
required by the OCS to the extent it would not constitute or would not be
reasonably likely to constitute a Material Adverse Effect); (B) the right of
Acquiror to acquire the Company pursuant to the Merger; (C) the right of
Acquiror to exercise full rights of ownership over the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries; or (D) the right of Acquiror or Surviving Corporation to
receive the services and other rights under the applicable Ancillary
Agreements; (ii) agree or be required to sell, license or otherwise dispose
of, hold separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise), or
divest itself of all or any portion of the business, assets or operations of
Acquiror or Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates including the
business, assets or operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or
(iii) otherwise take any steps to avoid or eliminate any impediment that may
be asserted under any Law governing competition, monopolies or
restrictive trade practices.

(c) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the parties shall
promptly notify the other parties of any communication it or any of its
Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the matters
that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other parties to review
in advance any proposed communication by such party to any Governmental
Authority. In the event that a Governmental Authority shall request that a
party to this Agreement participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry, such
party shall so advise the other parties and, to the extent reasonably
practical, shall consult with the other parties in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, give the other parties the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the parties will coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other parties may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing.
The parties will provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings
or communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 5.11. _Public Announcements_. On and after the date hereof and
through the Closing Date, the parties shall consult with each other before
issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. None of the
parties shall issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to obtaining the written approval of Acquiror and the Company, which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that to the
extent disclosure shall be required by applicable Law or Nasdaq, any party
may make any required disclosure without regard to whether approval has been
withheld or delayed.



 

42 Section 5.12. _Registration of Acquiror Common Stock_.

(a) Acquiror has prepared and filed with the SEC a registration statement on
Form S-3, Registration Number 333-132447 (the " _Shelf Registration
Statement_ "), relating to the registration, among other things, of the
issuance and resales of shares of Acquiror Common Stock. Acquiror shall, no
later than the Closing Date, file with the SEC a prospectus supplement
(together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Prospectus
Supplement_ ") to the Registration Statement, to permit the resale of the
shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the " _Registrable Shares_ ") issued under
this Agreement.

(b) Acquiror shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration
Statement to remain effective and available for resale of the Registrable
Shares and to file with the SEC such amendments and supplements as may be
necessary to keep the prospectus included in the Shelf Registration Statement
(the " _Prospectus_ ") current and in compliance in all material respects,
including filing any post-effective amendments or prospectus supplements
thereto, with the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder until the earliest of (i) the expiration of the
twenty-four (24) month period following the Closing Date, (ii) the sale of all
the Registrable Shares or (iii) the availability of Rule 144(k) of the
Securities Act to sell all of the Registrable Shares.

 

(c) The Stockholder Representative, on behalf of each of the Stockholders,
covenants and agrees with Acquiror that it will cooperate with Acquiror in
connection with the preparation of each Prospectus Supplement prior to and
after the Closing Date for so long as Acquiror is obligated to maintain the
effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, and will provide to
Acquiror, in writing, for use in a Prospectus Supplement or in an amendment
to the Shelf Registration Statement, information regarding each of the
Stockholders, the plan of distribution for the Registrable Shares and such
other information as Acquiror may reasonably request to prepare Prospectus
Supplements or amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement and to maintain
the effectiveness thereof.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.12, Acquiror
may suspend the availability of the Shelf Registration Statement and any
resales of Registrable Shares thereunder (each such period, a " _Suspension
Period_ ") (x) upon the issuance by the SEC of a stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement, the initiation of
proceedings with respect to the Shelf Registration Statement under Section
8(d) or 8(e) of the Securities Act or the initiation of an SEC review of the
Companys filings under the Exchange Act, (y) if an event (a " _Material
Event_ ") occurs and is continuing as a result of which the Shelf
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto,
or any document incorporated by reference therein would, in Acquirors
reasonable judgment, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or (z) the occurrence or existence of any
pending corporate development that, in the reasonable discretion of Acquiror,
makes it necessary to suspend the availability of the Shelf Registration
Statement and any resales of Registrable Shares thereunder, _provided_
Acquiror shall not have the right to suspend the Shelf Registration Statement
pursuant to clause (y) or (z) during the twenty-one (21) day period after the
Closing Date. Upon the occurrence of any such event, Acquiror shall notify the
Stockholder Representative, as agent of each of the Stockholders, that the
availability of the Shelf Registration Statement is suspended and, upon
receipt of any such notice by the Stockholder Representative, each Stockholder
agrees not to sell any Registrable Shares pursuant to the Shelf Registration
Statement until the Stockholder Representative is advised in writing by
Acquiror that the Shelf Registration Statement may be used, and has received
copies of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or
deemed incorporated by reference in the Shelf Registration
Statement. Acquiror will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
the use of the Shelf Registration Statement may be resumed (A) in the case of
clause (x) above, as promptly as is practicable, and use its best efforts to
ensure the use of the Shelf Registration Statement, (B) in the case of clause
(y) above, as soon as, in the reasonable judgment of Acquiror, public
disclosure of such Material Event would not be prejudicial to or contrary to
the interests of Acquiror or, if necessary to avoid unreasonable burden or
expense, as soon as practicable thereafter and (C) in the case of clause (z)
above, as soon as in the reasonable discretion of Acquiror, such suspension is
no longer appropriate. For the avoidance of doubt (and without prejudice to
the proviso contained in the first  



 

43  sentence of this Section 5.12(d)), nothing in this Section 5.12 shall impose
any obligation on Acquiror to engage in any discussions regarding a potential
corporate development or to cease or complete any such discussion within any
time period or otherwise. Acquiror shall be entitled to exercise its right
under this Section 5.12(d) to suspend the availability of the Shelf
Registration Statement or any Prospectus _provided_ that the aggregate
duration of all Suspension Periods shall not exceed thirty (30) days in any
three-month period (or sixty (60) days in any three-month period in the event
of a Material Event pursuant to which Acquiror has delivered a second notice
as required below) or ninety (90) days in any twelve-month period; _provided_
that in the case of a Material Event relating to an acquisition or a probable
acquisition or financing, recapitalization, business combination or other
similar transaction, Acquiror may deliver to the Stockholder Representative on
behalf of each of the Stockholders, a second notice to the effect set forth
above, which shall have the effect of extending the Suspension Period by up
to an additional thirty (30) days, or such shorter period of time as is
specified in such second notice. Acquiror shall not be required to specify in
any written notice the nature of the event giving rise to the Suspension
Period, and the Stockholder Representative and the Stockholders hereby agree
to hold such notice and any communications in response thereto in confidence.

Section 5.13. _Listing of Shares of Acquiror Common Stock_. Acquiror shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Acquiror Common Stock to
be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

Section 5.14. _Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance_.

(a) All rights to indemnification and permitted limitations of liability for
monetary damages existing in favor of the present or former directors,
officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than
for indemnification claims for Losses under Article VII of this Agreement)
(the " _Covered D andO Indemnitees_") as provided in the Companys certificate
of incorporation, bylaws and those certain indemnification agreements between
the Company and certain of its officers and directors as in effect on the
date hereof, or the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar
constitutive documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect as of
the date hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect (to the extent
consistent with applicable Law) after the Effective Time, without material
alteration or amendment. After the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Covered DandO
Indemnitees against all losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising out of
actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the full extent then
permitted under Delaware Law and by the Companys certificate of incorporation
or bylaws as in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ , that such
indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time
under applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to
periodically advance expenses as incurred with respect to the foregoing to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the
Person to whom the expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such
advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification.

(b) Acquiror shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than six (6)
years from the Effective Time the current policies of the directors and
officers liability insurance maintained by the Company, or to the extent such
coverage is not obtainable at the per annum cost presently in effect,
Acquiror shall purchase such coverage (on terms with respect to coverage and
amount no less favorable to such officers and directors than those of such
policies in effect on the date hereof) as may be obtained having a cost per
annum not to exceed 150% of the current annual premium paid by the Company
with respect to such current policies ( _provided, however_ , that Acquiror
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to such officers and
directors so long as no lapse in coverage occurs as a result of such
substitution) with respect to all matters, including the transactions
contemplated hereby, occurring prior to, and including, the Effective Time;
_provided_ that, if  



 

44  any claim or claims are asserted or made within such six-year period, such
insurance shall be continued in respect of such claim or claims until
final disposition of such claim or claims. A copy of such insurance policy
shall be provided to any director or officer of the Company upon request.

(c) The obligations of Acquiror (or any such successor) under this Section
5.14 shall not be terminated or modified following the Effective Time in such
a manner as to adversely affect any of the Covered DandO Indemnitees to whom
this Section 5.14 applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it
being expressly understood that this Section 5.14 is intended for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Covered DandO Indemnitees and
their respective heirs and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and
Acquiror and their respective successors or assigns).

Section 5.15. _Escrow Agreement_. Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative
agree to execute and deliver the Escrow Agreement at the Closing.

Section 5.16. _Working Capital Adjustment_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that, at Acquirors option and upon its written
request to the Company, on the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall deliver to Acquiror in writing an estimate of the
calculation of the Purchase Price Per Share of Company Common Stock (assuming,
solely for this purpose, that the Final Average Stock Price equals the closing
sale price per share of Acquiror Common Stock on the immediately prior
trading day) to be received by each Stockholder together with reasonably
detailed supporting documentation of each item used in the calculation
thereof, including a schedule of Company Transaction Expenses paid prior to
such date of delivery or to be paid prior to Closing and the Estimated Company
Transaction Expenses (the " _Merger Consideration Schedule_ ") and a statement
of the estimated Closing Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital_ "). The Estimated Closing Net Working Capital shall be
prepared by the Company in accordance with GAAP applied using the same
accounting methods, practices, principles, policies and procedures, with
consistent classifications, judgments and valuation and estimation and accrual
methodologies that were used in the preparation of the Companys Financial
Statements for the most recent fiscal year end and that were used in the
calculation of the Target Net Working Capital. The actual number of shares of
Acquiror Common Stock to be issued as Merger Consideration will be determined
based on the Final Average Stock Price.

(b) The Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, if delivered, and if not so
delivered, the Target Net Working Capital, shall be the basis for determining
the Closing Net Working Capital on the Closing Date, subject to adjustment as
provided below.

(c) " _Closing Net Working Capital_ " means (A) the consolidated current
assets of the Company and the Subsidiaries, less (B) the consolidated current
liabilities of the Company and the Subsidiaries, in each case determined as
of the open of business on the Closing Date determined in accordance with
GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices, principles,
policies and procedures, with consistent classifications, judgments and
valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the preparation of
the Companys Financial Statements for the most recent fiscal year end as if
such accounts were being prepared and audited as of a fiscal year end and that
were used in the calculation of the Target Net Working Capital.

(d) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Acquiror shall have the
option, in its sole discretion, to deliver to the Stockholder Representative
a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of the
open of business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") and a
statement of Closing Net Working Capital derived from the Closing Balance
Sheet (the " _Closing Net Working Capital Statement_ ") . The Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Net Working Capital Statement shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied using the same accounting methods, practices,
principles, policies and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and valuation and estimation methodologies that were used in the
preparation of the Companys audited Financial Statements for the most recent
fiscal year end as if such Closing Balance Sheet was as of a fiscal year end.



 

45 (e) The Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Net Working Capital Statement
(and the computation of Closing Net Working Capital indicated thereon)
delivered by Acquiror to the Stockholder Representative shall be conclusive
and binding upon the parties unless the Stockholder Representative, within
twenty (20) days after delivery to the Stockholder Representative of the
Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Net Working Capital Statement, notifies
Acquiror in writing that the Stockholder Representative disputes any of the
amounts set forth therein, specifying the nature of the dispute and the basis
therefor. The parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve any dispute and,
if the parties so resolve all disputes, the Closing Balance Sheet and the
Closing Net Working Capital Statement (and the computation of Closing Net
Working Capital indicated thereon), as amended to the extent necessary to
reflect the resolution of the dispute, shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties. If the parties do not reach agreement in resolving the dispute within
twenty (20) days after notice is given by the Stockholder Representative to
Acquiror pursuant to the second preceding sentence, the parties shall submit
the dispute to a mutually satisfactory partner in the New York City office of
the accounting firm of KPMG LLP or, if no partner at such firm will act, to a
partner at such other nationally recognized independent accounting firm which
is mutually agreeable to the parties (the " _Arbiter_ ") for resolution. If
the parties cannot agree on the selection of a partner at an independent
accounting firm to act as Arbiter, the parties shall request the American
Arbitration Association to appoint such a partner, and such appointment shall
be conclusive and binding on the parties. Promptly, but no later than twenty
(20) days after acceptance of his or her appointment as Arbiter, the Arbiter
shall determine (it being understood that in making such determination, the
Arbiter shall be functioning as an expert and not as an arbitrator), based
solely on written submissions by Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative,
and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute and shall render a
written report as to the resolution of the dispute and the
resulting computation of the Closing Net Working Capital which shall be
conclusive and binding on the parties. All proceedings conducted by the
Arbiter shall take place in the City of New York. In resolving any disputed
item, the Arbiter (x) shall be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and
(y) may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for
such items claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such
items claimed by either party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Arbiter
shall be allocated to and borne by Acquiror and the Stockholders based on the
inverse of the percentage that the Arbiters determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Arbiter. For example, should the items in dispute
total in amount to $1,000 and the Arbiter awards $600 in favor of the Selling
Stockholders position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne
by Acquiror and 40% of the costs would be borne by the Stockholders.

(f) Upon final determination of Closing Net Working Capital as provided in
the immediately preceding paragraph, (A) if Closing Net Working Capital is

the excess of Closing Net Working Capital over Estimated Closing Net Working
Capital and Acquiror shall promptly, but no later than five (5) business days
after such final determination, pay the amount of such difference in the form

Capital is less than Estimated Closing Net Working Capital (or less than the

calculated and delivered), the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be
decreased by the excess of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital (or the
Target Net Working Capital, as applicable) over Closing Net Working Capital
and Acquiror shall, at its option, either receive from the Acquiror Escrow
Amount the number of Acquiror Common Stock and/or cash equal to such
difference or require the Stockholders to severally return to Acquiror their
pro rata portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration in the form of Acquiror
Common Stock and/or cash equal to such difference and (C) if Closing Net
Working Capital is greater than the Target Net Working Capital, there shall

46 Section 5.17. _Israeli Tax Rulings_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the date hereof, Acquiror and the Company shall instruct their respective
Israeli counsel, advisors and accountants to prepare and file with the Israeli
Income Tax Authority an application for a ruling (a) confirming that (i) that
the assumption of the Company Stock Options and the conversion of the Options
to purchase shares of Acquiror Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.10
will not result in a requirement for an immediate Israeli tax payment and that
the Israeli taxation will be deferred until the exercise of such Assumed
Options, or in the case of Assumed Options that are part of a "Section 102
Plan," until the actual sale of the underlying shares of Acquiror Common Stock
by the holders of such Assumed Options; and (ii) that the "lock-up period"
under any "Section 102 Plan" will continue to run and will not be restarted as
a result of the replacement of the Assumed Options (which ruling may be
subject to customary conditions regularly associated with such a ruling) (the
" _Israeli Options Tax Ruling_ "), (b) that either: (i) exempts Acquiror, the
Company and its or their agents from any obligation to withhold Israeli Tax at
source from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement as part of the Merger Consideration or as part of the
assumption, conversion or replacement of Company Options, or clarifying that
no such obligation exists; or (ii) clearly instructs Acquiror, the Company
and their agents how such withholding at source is to be performed, and in
particular, with respect to the classes or categories of holders or former
holders of Shares from which Tax is to be withheld (if any), the rate or
rates of withholding to be applied (the " _Israeli Withholding Tax Pre-Ruling_
"), and (c) provides that the Escrow Amount shall not be subject to Israeli
Tax until actually received by the Stockholders (the " _Escrow Tax Ruling_ ";
and together with the Israeli Options Tax Ruling and the Israeli Withholding
Tax Pre-Ruling, the " _Israeli Tax Rulings_ "). Each of the Company and
Acquiror shall, and shall instruct their representatives and advisors to,
coordinate all activities and to cooperate with each other, with respect to
the preparation and filing of such application and in the preparation of any
written or oral submissions that may be necessary, proper or advisable to
obtain the Israeli Tax Rulings. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to obtain the Israeli Tax
Rulings, as promptly as practicable.

(a) Acquiror shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and file (or cause to be
filed) each Tax Return not previously filed and required to be filed by or on

taxable period beginning before the Closing Date, and shall cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to pay all Taxes shown as due thereon (subject to
indemnification rights provided by Section 7.2), Acquiror shall consult in
good faith with the Stockholder Representative prior to the filing of any such
Tax Return for which indemnification may be sought hereunder and shall
appropriately take into account any Tax liabilities included in the

Agreement or as otherwise required by Law, neither Acquiror nor its
Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries after the
Merger) may amend a Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or file or
amend any Tax election of the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each case, with
respect to a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date without the
consent of the Stockholders Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(c) Acquiror shall not cause or permit any of the Company or its Subsidiaries,
or any Affiliate of Acquiror, to effect after the Effective Time, any

that could give rise to any indemnity obligation under Section 7.2. 

(d) Following the Merger, Acquiror shall not permit or cause the Company to
fail to hold at least ninety percent (90%) of the fair market value of the
net assets and at least seventy percent (70%) of the fair market value of the
gross assets held by Sub immediately before the Merger. For purposes of this
Section 5.18(d), assets transferred from Acquiror to Sub are not included as
assets of Sub immediately before the Merger where such assets are used to pay
reorganization expenses, to pay creditors of the Company or to enable Sub  



 

47  to satisfy state minimum capitalization requirements (where the money is

shareholders who receive cash in the Merger will be included as assets of the
Company immediately prior to the Merger to extent, and only to the extent,

intention existing during the period beginning with the commencement of
negotiations (whether formal or informal) between Acquiror and the Company
regarding the Merger and ending at the Effective Time (the " _Pre-Merger
Period_ "), permit or cause any action that would cause the Acquiror Common
Stock issued in the Merger to cease to have voting rights which entitle the
holder to vote for directors of Acquiror.

(g) Acquiror shall not after the Merger, pursuant to a plan or intention
existing during the Pre-Merger Period, permit or cause the Company to issue
additional shares of stock of the Company, or take any other action, that
would result in Acquiror no longer owning stock in the Company constituting
"control" within the meaning of Section 368(c) of the Code.

existing during the Pre-Merger Period: (a) permit or cause the Company to
liquidate; (b) permit or cause the Company to merge with or into another
corporation; (c) permit or cause the Company to sell or otherwise dispose of
any of its assets or of any of the assets acquired from Sub except for

Regulations Section 1.368-1(d)(4)(ii)), to fail to either (a) continue the
Companys historic business or (b) use a significant portion of the Companys
historic business assets in a business, all within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(d).

(j) Except for repurchases or redemptions of Acquiror Common Stock that are
(i) acquired over the open market pursuant to Acquirors existing stock
repurchase program, or (ii) in connection with the termination of employment
in the ordinary course of business, neither Sub nor Acquiror nor any "related
person" of Sub or Acquiror (as such term is defined by Treasury Regulations
Section 1.368-1(e)(4)) shall, pursuant to a plan or intention existing during
the Pre-Merger Period, repurchase or redeem any of the Acquiror Common Stock
issued to the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger.

(k) Each party shall report the Merger as a reorganization under Section
368(a) of the Code for all relevant Tax purposes and shall adopt no Tax
reporting position inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a
reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, in each case unless otherwise
required by applicable Law.

amount of estimated Loss set forth in an Indemnification Claim exceeds a
reasonable estimate of Loss with respect to the Indemnification Claim. The
amount set forth in a notice of an Indemnification Claim shall be included in

appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction or a written agreement
between Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative to the contrary,
without regard to the resolution of the underlying Indemnification Claim.

(b) Each Indemnification Claim made by an Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be

this Article VII and (ii) in the case of Acquiror Indemnified Parties, the
Acquiror Escrow Amount shall be the sole source of indemnification hereunder,
except with respect to any breaches of the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 3.1(a)(i) (Organization and Qualification), 3.2
(Authority) 3.4 (Capitalization) and 3.15 (Taxes) and Section 2.3 (Title) of
the Consent and Indemnity Agreement and intentional misrepresentation by the
Company or fraud, for which any Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to seek recovery for any such Loss on any available basis, including by
seeking recovery from the Acquiror Escrow Amount and/or the Stockholders on a
several basis. Prior to Closing, each of the parties hereto shall be liable
for any breaches of this Agreement to the extent provided under applicable
Law.

Section 7.5. _Third Party and Other Indemnification Claims_.

(a) In order for an Acquiror Indemnified Party or Stockholder Indemnified
Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a
Loss or a claim or demand made by any Person not a party to this Agreement
against the Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") or a Tax Claim,
such Indemnified Party shall deliver notice thereof to the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders, or to Acquiror, as applicable
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), promptly after receipt by such Indemnified
Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, or, in the case of Taxes of
the Company or its Subsidiaries which may give rise to Losses subject to
indemnification hereunder (a " _Tax Claim_ ") promptly after receipt by such
Indemnified Party of notice of a pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment
or adjustment (a " _Tax Controversy_ ") which may give rise to a Tax Claim
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for
indemnification hereunder, and the amount or method of computation of the
amount of such claim (if known). At such time as an officer of Acquiror or a
Stockholder obtains actual knowledge of any Indemnification Claim other than
with respect to a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give
notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party. Following the Indemnified Partys
delivery of such notice of a Third Party Claim, or any other Indemnification
Claim, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such
other information with respect to such claim that is available to the
Indemnified Party as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.
The failure or delay to provide such prompt notice of a Third Party Claim a
Tax Claim or any other Indemnification Claim, however, shall not release any
Indemnifying Party from any of his or its obligations under this Article VII
except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by
such failure or delay.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party within thirty (30) days (or less if the nature
of the Third Party Claim or a Tax Claim requires) after receipt of notice of
the Third Party Claim or Tax Controversy, as the case may be, demonstrates
that, if and as of such time, the Indemnity Cap, minus the Aggregate Claim
Amount as of such date, is sufficient in order to indemnify for the full
amount of the Loss, if determined, or the reasonably estimated amount of the
Loss, as the case may be, in connection with such claim, or the
Stockholder Representative shall demonstrate to the Acquiror Indemnified
Partys reasonable satisfaction that the Indemnifying Parties have sufficient
financial resources through the Escrow Agreement in order to indemnify the
Acquiror Indemnified Party for the full amount of the Loss, the Indemnifying
Party may, subject to Section 7.5(c) hereof, elect to assume control over the
compromise or defense of such Third Party Claim or Tax Claim, at such
Indemnifying Partys own expense and by such Indemnifying Partys own counsel
(the counsel selected by the Stockholder Representative in the case where the
Stockholders are the Indemnifying Parties), which counsel must be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, _provided_ , that (i) the Indemnified
Party shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and may, if such
Indemnified Party so desires, employ counsel at such Indemnified Partys own
expense to assist in the handling (but not control the defense) of any Third
Party Claim or Tax Claim, _provided_ that in no event may any Indemnified
Party settle such Third Party Claim or Tax Claim, without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party; (ii) in the event of an Action that is the subject of a
Third Party Claim or Tax Claim in which both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party are named as parties and either the Indemnifying Party or
the  



 

54  Indemnified Party determines with advice of counsel that there may be one or
more legal defenses available to it that are different from or additional
to those available to such Person or that a conflict of interest between such
Persons may exist in respect of such Action, then the Indemnified Party may,
if it so desires, employ one additional counsel at the Indemnifying Partys
expense to represent the Indemnified Party in such Third Party Claim (in the
event the Indemnified Party is an Acquiror Indemnified Party, such expenses to
be paid out of the Acquiror Escrow Amount or pursuant to the Consent and
Indemnity Agreement, if applicable); (iii) the Indemnifying Party shall keep
the Indemnified Party advised of all material events with respect to any Third
Party Claim or Tax Claim; (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior
written approval (which approval may be withheld or delayed in the
Indemnified Partys sole discretion) of the Indemnified Party before entering
into any settlement, adjustment or compromise of such claim involving
injunctive or other equitable relief being asserted against any Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent
such injunctive or other equitable relief relates to the use by the Company
(or after the Closing, by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates)
of Intellectual Property, then such approval may not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; and (v) no Indemnifying Party will, without the prior written
consent of each Indemnified Party, settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened action in respect of which
indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not any such Indemnified
Party is a party to such action), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party, or the Indemnifying
Party otherwise agrees, to satisfy such settlement, compromise or consent and
includes an unconditional release of all such Indemnified Parties from all
liability arising out of such claim or Action. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Party has been indemnified
for any Loss hereunder and at any time thereafter the Indemnified Party
recovers all or any portion of such Loss (such amount, the " _Recovered
Amount_ ") from a Third Party, the Indemnified Party shall promptly refund the
Recovered Amount (in the form received from any such Indemnifying Party) to
Indemnifying Parties or return the Recovered Amount to the Acquiror Escrow
Amount if withdrawn therefrom and the Escrow Agreement has not terminated;
_provided_ , that no Indemnified Party shall have any obligation to seek such
recoveries.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to have sole control over (and if
the Indemnified Party so desires, the Indemnified Party shall have sole
control over) the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of (but the
Indemnifying Party shall nevertheless be required to pay all Losses incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection with such defense, settlement,
adjustment or compromise in accordance with this Article VII) a Third Party
Claim or Tax Claim: (i) if the Losses pursuant to such Third Party Claim or
Tax Claim are likely to exceed the Indemnity Cap, less the Aggregate Claim
Amount as of such date ( _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clause
(i), the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim or Tax Claim which would result in an indemnification claim without the
consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); (ii) if the Acquiror Indemnified Party reasonably
believes that the Indemnifying Parties do not have the financial resources,
whether through the Escrow Agreement, to pay substantially all of the Losses
in connection with such Third Party Claim or Tax Claim or (iii) if allowing
the Indemnifying Party to have sole control over the defense, settlement
or compromise would have an adverse effect on an important commercial
relationship of the Acquiror Indemnified Party or on the Taxes of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries following the Closing.

(d) If the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the compromise or defense
against the asserted liability, fails to timely and properly notify the
Indemnified Party of its election as herein provided, or, at any time after
assuming such defense, fails to diligently defend against such Third Party
Claim or Tax Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party may, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, pay, compromise, adjust or defend in good faith
against such asserted liability (but the Indemnifying Party shall nevertheless
be required to pay all Losses incurred in good faith by the Indemnified Party
in connection with such defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise) and
the Indemnified Party will consult with the Indemnifying Party prior to any
adjustment, settlement or compromise. In connection with any defense of a
Third Party Claim or Tax Claim, all of the parties hereto shall, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate in the defense or prosecution
thereof and to in good faith retain and furnish such records,  



 

55  information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested by a
party hereto in connection therewith.

Section 7.6. _Limits on Indemnification_.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.6, the maximum aggregate
amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered by any Indemnified Party
under Section 7.2 shall be the Acquiror Escrow Amount or under Section 7.3
shall be an amount equal to the Acquiror Escrow Amount (valued as of the
Closing Date) (such cap on indemnification, as applicable, the " _Indemnity
Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnity Cap and the Threshold
shall not be applicable with respect to, and each Acquiror Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to be indemnified, from the Acquiror Escrow Amount and/or
by the Stockholders on a several basis, for, all Losses arising out of or
resulting from the indemnification obligation with respect to (x) the breach
or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty (A) of the Company contained
in Sections 3.2 (Authority) 3.4 (Capitalization), and 3.15 (Taxes) hereof, (B)
of any Stockholder contained in Section 2.3 (Title) of the Consent and
Indemnity Agreement or (y) intentional misrepresentation by the Company or
fraud.

(b) Without limitation of the indemnity obligations under this Article VII,
from and after the consummation of the Closing, (i) the Company shall have no
obligation or liability whatsoever in respect of Losses arising out of or
resulting from the indemnification obligations in this Article VII; and (ii)
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Stockholders
shall have no right of indemnification, contribution or reimbursement from or
remedy against the Company and/or the Surviving Corporation as a result of any
indemnification they are required to make under or arising out of the breach
or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation in
this Agreement or in any certificate, document or other instrument delivered
herewith, and, except as set forth in Section 5.14, the Stockholders shall be
deemed to have released, waived and forever discharged any right to
indemnification, contribution or reimbursement that they may have at any time
after the consummation of the Closing against the Company and/or
the Surviving Corporation under or arising out of the breach or inaccuracy of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other obligation contained in this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or in any certificate, document or other
instrument delivered herewith or therewith.

(c) Following the Effective Date, no party shall have any obligation to
indemnify any of the other parties pursuant to this Article VII unless and
until the aggregate amount of all such individual Losses incurred or sustained
by such party exceeds 1% of the Merger Consideration (the " _Threshold_ "), in
which case the applicable Indemnifying Parties shall be liable from the first
dollar of all such Losses, subject to Section 7.6(a).

Section 7.7. _Adjustment to Purchase Price_. Any indemnification payable
pursuant to this Article VII shall be treated for Tax purposes as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration.

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

Section 8.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time

(b) (i) by the Company, if Acquiror or Sub breaches or fails to perform in any
respect any of their representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2 hereof, (B) cannot be or
has not been cured within thirty (30) days following delivery of written
notice of such breach or failure to perform and (C) has not been waived by the
Company; or (ii) by Acquiror, if the Company or any Stockholder breaches or

thirty (30) days following delivery of written notice of such breach or
failure to perform and (z) has not been waived by Acquiror;

(c) by either the Company or Acquiror if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by June 30, 2006 (the " _Termination Date_ "). The right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not be available if
the failure of the party so requesting termination to fulfill any obligation
under this Agreement shall have been the cause of the failure of the Merger to
be consummated on or prior to such date;

(d) by either the Company or Acquiror in the event that any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions

(e) by either the Company or Acquiror if the Average Closing Price is $9.25 or
less.

Section 8.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1 hereof, this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and there shall be no continuing obligation or liability on the

4.9 hereof relating to brokers fees, Section 5.8(a) hereof relating to the
Confidentiality Agreement, Section 5.11 hereof relating to

party beneficiaries, Section 9.9 hereof relating to governing law, Section
9.10 hereof relating to submission to exclusive jurisdiction and this Section
8.2; and (ii) that nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for
any breach of this Agreement or any agreement made as of the date hereof or
subsequent hereto pursuant to this Agreement.

CONSENT AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT EXHIBIT B

WRITTEN CONSENT

OF THE

HOLDERS OF CAPITAL STOCK

OF

PASSAVE, INC. EXHIBIT C

MERGER CONSIDERATION

I. _Aggregate Merger Consideration_.

On the Closing Date, Acquiror shall pay to the Stockholders the Merger
Consideration, less the Acquiror Escrow Amount, which Acquiror Escrow Amount
shall be placed in escrow pursuant to Section 2.12. of the Agreement. The
aggregate number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock that will constitute the
Merger Consideration shall be calculated by dividing (x) the Net Purchase
Price by (y) the Final Average Stock Price (the " _Aggregate Stock Merger
Consideration_ "). The " _Final Average Stock Price_ " shall equal the Average
Signing Price increased or decreased by the amount the Average Closing Price
is greater than or less than the Average Signing Price, as the case may be,
up to a maximum increase of $14.39 or a maximum decrease of $10.27.

For purposes of this Agreement, " _Net Purchase Price_ " shall mean (A)
$300,000,000, minus (B) the amount by which the Target Net Working Capital
exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital ( _provided_ that the
Company Transaction Expenses, which are assumed to be $5,000,000 in the
Target Net Working Capital, shall not be permitted to exceed $5,000,000
without the prior written consent of the Acquiror and any such excess shall
result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the Net Purchase Price).

The Aggregate Stock Merger Consideration is subject to further adjustment
after the Closing as contemplated in Section 5.16.

II. _Per Share Merger Consideration_.

The number of shares of Acquiror Common Stock (after giving effect to a
conversion of the Company Preferred Stock and the Warrants) which shall be
allocated to each share of Company Common Stock and distributed
to Stockholders shall be calculated as follows:

A. The Net Purchase Price shall be divided by the sum of the following:

(i) all Company Common Stock (after giving effect to a conversion of the
Company Preferred Stock and the Warrants as contemplated above) outstanding as
of the Effective Time,

(ii) all Vested Options of the Company outstanding as of the Effective Time,
and



 

C-1 (iii) all unvested stock options of the Company outstanding as of the
Effective Time, reduced by: 

(a) stock option grants made on or after March 1, 2006 and approved to by
Acquiror,

(b) 150,000 of unvested options, and

(c) shares of Company Common Stock assumed to be repurchased from gross stock
option and warrant exercise proceeds calculated in accordance with the
treasury stock method of accounting.

B. The result of the calculation in Section A above is the " _Purchase Price
Per Share of Company Common Stock._ " The " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall equal the
Purchase Price Per Share of Company Common Stock divided by the Final Average
Stock Price. For purposes of clarification, an example of the preceding
calculation is set forth in Annex I.

The portion of the Aggregate Stock Merger Consideration allocable to each
Stockholder shall be calculated in accordance with the Exchange Ratio and
distributed to Stockholders holding the Shares outstanding as of the Closing
in accordance with the rights, powers and privileges of the Company Common
Stock and the Company Preferred Stock, respectively, as set forth in the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing and in accordance with Article ii of the Agreement.



 

C-2 EXHIBIT D

In the event that the Israeli Withholding Tax Pre-Ruling has not been received
prior to May 15, 2006, then, as provided in Section 6.2(g), the receipt of
such ruling shall no longer be a condition to Closing, and instead the
provisions of this Exhibit D shall govern.



   1. | Upon the Closing, Acquiror shall follow the provisions of Section
2.9 with respect to each Stockholder or Warrant Holder who provides Acquiror
with a valid exemption from Israeli withholding tax or will withhold tax at a
reduced rate with respect to each Stockholder or Warrant Holder who provides
Acquiror with a valid confirmation of a reduced rate of Israeli withholding
tax (" _Valid Exemption_ "). A "Valid Exemption" shall be either an
unequivocal exemption or confirmation of a reduced withholding rate issued by
the Israel Tax Authorities or such other document, opinion or form which, in
the sole discretion of Acquiror, is sufficient to enable Acquiror to conclude
that no withholding or a reduced rate of withholding, as applicable of Israeli
Tax is required with respect to the particular Stockholder or Warrant Holder
in question. 
---|--- 


   2. | With respect to all other Stockholders and Warrant Holders (each,
a " _Withheld Securityholder_ "), Acquiror shall deposit with the Israeli

ESCROW AGREEMENT

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of [ _ _],
2006, is by and among PMC-Sierra, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Acquiror_
"), Ron Hiram, solely in his capacity as representative of the
Stockholders, Vested Option Holders and Warrant Holders (the " _Stockholder
Representative_ ") of Passave, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_
"), and Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware banking corporation (the "
_Escrow Agent_ "). All initially capitalized terms used but not defined in
this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Merger
Agreement (as defined below).

_RECITALS_

WHEREAS, Acquiror, Polaris Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a
direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror (" _Sub_ "), the Company and the
Stockholder Representative have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of April 4, 2006 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), that provides, among
other things, that Sub would merge with and into the Company and the Company
would continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware
as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror (the " _Merger_ ");

WHEREAS, in furtherance of the purposes of the Merger Agreement and as a
condition to the willingness of Acquiror and Sub to enter into the Merger
Agreement, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, Acquiror,
certain stockholders of the Company listed therein (the " _Principal
Stockholders_ "), and the Stockholder Representative, solely in his capacity
as the representative of the Stockholders, Vested Option Holders and Warrant
Holders (collectively, the " _Securityholders_ ") have entered into a Consent
and Indemnity Agreement (the " _Consent and Indemnity Agreement_ ");

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement contemplates that a portion of the Merger
Consideration payable to the Securityholders of the Company will be deposited
in escrow with the Escrow Agent, to be held and distributed by the Escrow
Agent on the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and
herein;

WHEREAS, concurrently herewith, Acquiror is depositing with the Escrow Agent
the Acquiror Escrow Amount to be held as security for the
indemnification obligations under the applicable provisions of Article VII of
the Merger Agreement and Article IV of the Consent and Indemnity Agreement;
and

WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent is willing to hold and administer such amounts and
any income thereon and additions thereto, and to pay and distribute the
amounts held by it in accordance with this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the respective
agreements and covenants contained herein, and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: _AGREEMENT_

1\. _Appointment of Escrow Agent_. Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative
hereby appoint the Escrow Agent to act as escrow agent hereunder and the
Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to hold and
administer the Escrow Fund (as hereinafter defined) in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

2\. _Delivery of Escrowed Shares_.

(a) Concurrently herewith, Acquiror shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,
pursuant to Section 2.12 of the Merger Agreement on behalf of the Escrow
Contributor, to the Escrow Agent, a number of certificates representing the
shares of Acquiror Common Stock (the " _Escrow Shares_ "), all issued in the
name of the Escrow Agent or its designee, as Escrow Agent hereunder, with an
aggregate value equal to the Acquiror Escrow Amount. Acquiror and the
Stockholder Representative agree that with respect to shares of Acquiror
Common Stock that will be issued upon exercise of the Vested Options and
Warrants, 10% of such shares of Acquiror Common Stock shall be deposited into
the Escrow Fund, and the Stockholders shall not be required to deposit shares
of Acquiror Common Stock on behalf of the Vested Option Holders and Warrant
Holders. The Escrow Shares shall be maintained by, and shall be under the
exclusive dominion and control of, the Escrow Agent and shall be disbursed by
the Escrow Agent only in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
The portion of Escrow Shares deposited in respect and for the account of each
Escrow Contributor is set forth next to the name of such Securityholder on
Schedule 1 attached hereto. The Escrow Agent shall maintain a record of the
amount of Escrow Shares and/or cash maintained in each account of each Escrow
Contributor as long as Escrow Funds remain in such account.

(b) In connection with a sale of Escrow Shares by an Escrow Contributor, the
Stockholder Representative, on behalf of such Escrow Contributor, shall be
permitted, from time to time, to instruct the Escrow Agent to release some or
all of the Escrow Shares constituting such Escrow Contributors Allocated
Escrow Portion by delivering to the Escrow Agent and Acquiror a letter of
instruction that indicates the number of Escrow Shares to be sold, the name of
the Escrow Contributor whose Escrow Shares are being sold, the date of such
sale and the broker or other Person whose account shall be credited with such
released Escrow Shares, and representing to each of the Escrow Agent and
Acquiror that the sale will comply with all applicable laws, including all
federal and state securities laws in the United States and, if applicable,
securities laws outside the United States. Simultaneously with the sale of
such Escrow Shares, the Escrow Agent shall receive, for deposit into the
Escrow Fund and for the account of such Escrow Contributor, an amount of cash
equal to the proceeds received by such Escrow Contributor (or its assignee)
with respect to such sale, net of brokerage commissions, if any (the "
_Cash Exchange_ "). In addition, the Stockholder Representative, on behalf of
each Escrow Contributor, shall be permitted, from time to time, to instruct
the Escrow Agent to release some or all of the Escrow Shares constituting an
Escrow Contributors Allocated Escrow Portion by delivering to the Escrow
Agent and Acquiror a letter that indicates the number of Escrow Shares to be
released, the name of the Escrow Contributor whose Escrow Shares are being
released and the broker or other Person whose account shall be credited with
such released Escrow Shares, and by providing to the Escrow Agent, for deposit
into the Escrow Fund and for the account of such Escrow Contributor, an amount
of cash equal to the value of the Escrow  



 

2  Shares to be released, which shall be determined in accordance with Section
6 hereof. All of the cash to be received as contemplated in this Section 2(b)
will be retained as part of the Escrow Fund for the period of time Acquiror
Escrow Amount is required to remain in escrow hereunder and pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. As used herein, " _Escrow Fund_ "
shall mean the Escrow Shares together with any cash, securities or other
property distributed in respect of or in exchange for any Escrow Shares,
whether by way of Cash Exchange, dividends or other distributions, stock
splits, reorganizations or reclassifications or otherwise, or realized upon
disposition or in connection with release pursuant to this Section 2 and
Section 8 of this Agreement or any investment held from time to time by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 2 of the Agreement, including
investment income earned thereon, less any amounts paid out pursuant to this
Agreement. The Escrow Agent hereby acknowledges, upon execution hereof,
receipt of the Escrow Fund and agrees to hold, invest and dispose of the
Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
Escrow Agent further agrees that upon receipt of any dividends or similar
distributions with respect to the Escrow Shares, it will promptly deliver
such dividends or distributions to the Stockholder Representative to such
account or accounts designated by the Stockholder Representative, who will
then promptly deliver such dividends or distributions to the applicable
Securityholders. 

3\. _Transferability_. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
respective interests of the Escrow Contributor in the Escrow Fund shall not
be assignable or transferable, other than solely by operation of law to the
affiliates, heirs, administrators, personal representative or devisees of a
deceased Escrow Contributor. The Escrow Contributors shall not pledge, grant
a lien or other security interest, grant an option or otherwise encumber their
respective interests in the Escrow Shares. Any assignment, transfer or
encumbrance of an interest in the Escrow Shares in violation of this Section 3
shall be void. Nothing in this Section 3 shall operate to restrict the right
of any Securityholder to sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of or
otherwise encumber any of his, her or its Escrow Shares subject to compliance
with Section 2 and Section 8 of this Agreement.

4\. _Rights and Obligations of the Parties_.

(a) _Method of Asserting Claims_. Subject to Section 4(b) hereof, if on or
prior to April __, 2007 (the first anniversary of the Closing Date) (the "
_Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall receive one or more Officers
Certificate (as defined below), then (x) the Escrow Agent shall, with respect
to an Officers Certificate referred to in clause (A)(i) of the definition
thereof, establish upon receipt of such Officers Certificate a reserve within
the Escrow Fund for the amount of estimated Losses set forth in the Officers
Certificate or (y) on the fifteenth (15th) day after receipt by the
Stockholder Representative of a duplicate copy of such Officers Certificate
with respect to an Officers Certificate referred to in clause (A)(ii) of the
definition thereof, deliver to Acquiror out of the Escrow Fund, Acquiror
Common Stock and/or cash (at the option of Acquiror if an Escrow Contributor
has cash in his, her or its account) in an amount equal in value to the
amount of Losses set forth in the Officers Certificate. An " _Officer s
Certificate_" means a certificate signed by an officer of Acquiror (A)
either: (i) stating that an Indemnification Claim has arisen and setting
forth a reasonable estimate of the expected amount of such Losses; or (ii)
stating that an Acquiror Indemnified Party has incurred Losses for which it is
entitled to be indemnified pursuant to Article VII of the Merger Agreement
and/or Article IV of the Consent and Indemnity Agreement and specifying  



 

3  the amount of such Losses, and (B) describing in reasonable detail the
nature of such claim and the section or sections of the Merger Agreement
and/or the Consent and Indemnity Agreement upon which such claim is based,
whether such claim is a Third Party Claim and whether such claim is a Covered
Company Claim or a Covered Stockholder Claim and, if a Covered Stockholder
Claim, the Stockholder or Stockholders to which such claim relates.

(b) _Objections to Claims_. At the time of the delivery of an
Officers Certificate to the Escrow Agent, Acquiror shall deliver a duplicate
copy to the Stockholder Representative. The Stockholder Representative may
deliver an objection notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to the Escrow Agent
and Acquiror with respect to any Officers Certificate delivered by Acquiror
pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof, provided delivery of such Objection Notice is
made prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on the tenth (10th) Business Day after
the receipt by the Stockholder Representative of the duplicate copy of such
Officers Certificate (it is understood and agreed that the Stockholder
Representative shall not have the right to object to any matter set forth in
an Officers Certificate (including Acquirors reasonable estimate of Losses
relating to an Indemnification Claim or the amount of Losses an Acquiror
Indemnified Party has incurred) unless such Objection Notice is delivered to
Acquiror and the Escrow Agent prior to the expiration of such 10- Business Day
period). During such 10-Business Day period, the Escrow Agent shall not
deliver to Acquiror any portion of the Escrow Fund with respect to the Losses
identified in the Officers Certificate unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Stockholder Representative to make
such delivery (it is understood and agreed, however, that the Escrow Agent,
in accordance with clause (x) of Section 4(a) hereof, shall establish a
reserve in the amount set forth in such Officers Certificate upon receipt
thereof and such reserve shall be reduced only pursuant to a joint written
instruction signed by Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative or as set
forth in Section 4(c)). After the expiration of such 10-Business Day period,
if no Objection Notice has been received from the Stockholder Representative,
the Escrow Agent shall, with respect to an Officers Certificate referred to
in clause (A)(ii) of the definition thereof, distribute to Acquiror, no later
than the fifteenth (15th) day after receipt by the Stockholder Representative
of a duplicate copy of any such Officers Certificate, the amount of Loss
incurred as set forth in the Officers Certificate; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event an Objection Notice shall not include an objection to the
entire amount of Losses set forth in an Officers Certificate, no later than
the fifteenth (15th) day after receipt by the Stockholder Representative of a
duplicate copy of any such Officers Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall
distribute the amount as to which no objection shall be made; _provided_ ,
_further_ , if at the time of a proposed distribution for a Covered Company
Claim to an Acquiror Indemnified Party, a claim for indemnification for a
Covered Stockholder Claim (as defined in the Consent and Indemnity Agreement)
has previously been paid, then the amount of the distribution shall be
adjusted pursuant to Section 4(d) hereof, if required pursuant to the terms
of such section.

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts_. If the Stockholder Representative shall timely
deliver an Objection Notice pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof, the Stockholder
Representative and Acquiror shall attempt to agree upon the rights of the
respective Parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder
Representative and Acquiror should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both such Parties and shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and distribute Acquiror Common Stock and/or cash (at the
option of Acquiror if an Escrow Contributor has cash in his, her or its
account) from, or reduce the amount of a reserve  



 

4  in, the Escrow Fund, as the case may be, in accordance with the terms
thereof. If no such agreement can be reached after thirty (30) days following
the delivery of an Objection Notice, then the Stockholder Representative or
Acquiror may in accordance with the terms hereof bring a legal action or
proceeding with respect to the matter that is the subject of such Objection
Notice and such distribution or reduction in a reserve shall be made only
pursuant to a joint written instruction signed by Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative or the final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction (as certified to the Escrow Agent in writing by Acquiror and the
Stockholder Representative); provided, that, if at the time of such proposed
distribution to an Acquiror Indemnified Party, a claim for indemnification for
a Covered Stockholder Claim has been previously paid, then the amount of the
distribution shall be adjusted pursuant to Section 4(d) hereof, if required
pursuant to the terms of such section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if no
agreement is reached after thirty (30) days following the delivery of
an Objection Notice and no legal action or proceeding has been commenced by
any party hereto relating to such Objection Notice prior to the Termination
Date (and no agreement with respect to the dispute has been reached prior to
the Termination Date), the Officers Certificate relating to such Objection
Notice that was delivered pursuant to Section 4(a) shall be deemed to have
been withdrawn.

(d) _Covered Stockholder Claims_.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
following meanings assigned to them:

" _Allocated Amount_ " means, with respect to any Securityholder at any time,
the greater of zero and an amount equal to (1) such Securityholders Escrow
Amount minus (2) the aggregate amount of Covered Stockholder Claims in respect
of such Securityholder previously released from the Escrow Fund
and distributed to Acquiror Indemnified Parties minus (3) the aggregate Pro
Rata Portions of Covered Company Claims previously released from the Escrow
Fund and distributed to Acquiror Indemnified Parties in respect of such
Securityholder. 

" _Applicable Percentage_ " means, with respect to any Securityholder, the
percentage of the Escrow Fund set forth opposite such Securityholders name
on Schedule 1 attached hereto.

" _Securityholder s Escrow Amount_" means, with respect to any
Securityholder, an amount equal to such Securityholders Applicable Percentage
times the Acquiror Escrow Amount.

" _Pro Rata Portion_ " means the amount obtained by multiplying the
Applicable Percentage and the amount which would be distributed from (or
reserved against) the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section 4 hereof.

(ii) If, at the time of any proposed distribution of any amounts to any
Acquiror Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 4 hereof with respect to a
Covered Company Claim, (1) a Covered Stockholder Claim has previously been
paid and, (2)(A) as a result,  



 

5  any Securityholders Pro Rata Portion of the claim giving rise to the
distribution exceeds (B) such Securityholders Allocated Amount prior
to giving effect to such distribution (the amount by which (A) exceeds (B),
the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), then the aggregate amount distributed to Acquiror
Indemnified Parties from the Escrow Account with respect to such claim shall
be reduced by such Shortfall Amount.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement or the Consent and Indemnity Agreement, (A) a Securityholders
Escrow Amount shall not be reduced or reserved against as a result of any
Covered Stockholder Claim with respect to any other Securityholder, and (B)
for any Covered Stockholder Claim, the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall
only be entitled to recover from the Escrow Fund an amount up to such
breaching Securityholders Allocated Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, if an
Acquiror Indemnified Party incurs a Loss arising out of any Covered
Stockholder Claim and recovers from the Escrow Fund less than the full amount
of such Loss, such Acquiror Indemnified Party shall retain its ability to
recover the excess amount from the applicable Stockholder. 

(e) _Notices of Distributions_. As promptly as practicable following the
distribution of any amounts from the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall send
a written statement to Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative stating the
amount of the distribution and the amount remaining in the Escrow Fund (and

Agent joint instructions to invest or reinvest the Escrow Fund.

obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be limited to those expressly set forth
herein, and no additional duties, responsibilities or obligations shall
be inferred or implied. The Escrow Agents duties are as a depository only,

(b) If the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain as to its duties or rights
hereunder or shall receive written instructions, claims or demands which, in
its opinion, are in conflict with any of the provisions of this Agreement, it
shall be entitled to refrain from taking any action other than to keep safely
the Escrow Fund until it shall be directed otherwise pursuant to a joint
written notice from Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative. This
Agreement shall not create any fiduciary duty of the Escrow Agent to any
Party.

or refraining from any action with respect to the Escrow Fund.

Escrow Agent the names of any other persons authorized to act for Acquiror
under this Agreement. The Escrow Agent may rely on and shall be authorized and
protected in acting or failing to act in accordance with this Agreement upon
the written or facsimile instructions that it reasonably believes to be
genuine, with respect to any matter relating to the Escrow Fund, of any
Authorized Personnel acting on behalf of Acquiror or by the Stockholder
Representative acting on behalf of the Securityholders. 

12\. _Risk to Escrow Agent_. Unless otherwise specifically provided for

in the exercise of any of its rights or powers. The Escrow Agent shall be
responsible for holding, investing, reinvesting and disbursing the Escrow
Fund pursuant to this  



 

8  Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall the Escrow Agent be
liable for special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any
kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the
Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and
regardless of the form of action, _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , the
Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability for not performing any act or
fulfilling any duty, obligation or responsibility hereunder by reason of any
occurrence beyond the control of the Escrow Agent (including, but not limited
to, any act or provision of any present or future law or regulation or
governmental authority, any act of God or war or the unavailability of the
Federal Reserve Bank wire or facsimile or other wire or communication
facility).

13\. _Investigation by Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent shall not be required
or bound to make any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any
resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request, consent, entitlement order, approval or other paper or document.

14\. _Escrow Agent s Execution of Power_. The Escrow Agent may execute any of
the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly
or by or through agents, attorneys, custodians, or nominees appointed with
due care and shall be responsible or liable for any action or inaction of any
agent, attorney, custodian or nominee so appointed.

15\. _Successor to Escrow Agent_. Any corporation into which the Escrow Agent
may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Escrow Agent shall be
a party, or any corporation succeeding to the business of the Escrow Agent
shall be the successor of the Escrow Agent hereunder without the execution or
filing of any paper with any Party except where an instrument of transfer
or assignment is required by law to effect such succession, anything herein
to the contrary notwithstanding.

16\. _Legal Proceedings_. The Escrow Agent shall not be required to institute
legal proceedings of any kind. If at any time the Escrow Agent is served with
any judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, writ or other form of
judicial or administrative process which in any way affects the Escrow Fund
(including, but not limited to, orders of attachment or garnishment or other
forms of levies or injunctions or stays relating to the transfer of the Escrow
Fund), the Escrow Agent is authorized to comply therewith in any manner it or
legal counsel of its own choosing deems appropriate; and if the Escrow Agent
complies with any such judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree,
writ or other form of judicial or administrative process, the Escrow
Agent shall not be liable to any of the parties or to any other Person even
though such order, judgment, decree, writ or process may be subsequently
modified or vacated or otherwise determined to have been without legal force
or effect unless the Escrow Agent has actual knowledge of the lack of
validity of such order, judgment, decree, writ or process.

17\. _Taxes and Income on the Escrow Fund_.

(a) All distributions to any Acquiror Indemnified Party in accordance with
Section 4 hereof shall be treated for all Tax purposes as an adjustment to
the Merger Consideration.



 

9 (b) All investment income accruing on the funds held in the Escrow Fund or
with respect thereto shall be retained by the Escrow Agent for release in
accordance with Section 4 hereof.

(c) The Securityholders shall be treated as the owners of the Escrow Fund and
shall be responsible for and pay when due all Taxes attributable to investment
income and other amounts accruing thereon or with respect thereto until such
time as the Escrow Fund is released in accordance with Section 4 hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Securityholders shall be reimbursed from the
Escrow Fund for the payment of Taxes that are required to be paid by the
Securityholder on any such investment income accruing under Section 17(b) by
applicable Law, upon delivery to the Escrow Agent of a certificate from
Acquiror and the applicable Securityholder that identifies the amount to be
reimbursed for such payment of Taxes.

(d) Each Securityholder shall provide to the Escrow Agent his, her or its
taxpayer identification number documented by an appropriate Form W-8 or W-9,
as applicable, no later than the Closing Date. Failure so to provide such
forms may prevent or delay disbursements from the Escrow Fund and the Escrow
Agent may be required to withhold tax on any interest treated as being paid in
respect of such distribution. Any payments or distribution of the Escrow Fund
to any Securityholder shall be subject to applicable withholding regulations
then in force in the United States, Israel or any other jurisdiction, as
applicable.

18\. _Fees of the Escrow Agent_. Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative,
strictly as representative and agent of the Securityholders and not
as individuals, each covenant and agree, jointly and severally to pay to the
Escrow Agent the fees and expenses set forth on _Exhibit B_ hereto. The
Company is paying the Securityholders portion of such fees and expenses on
behalf of the Securityholders concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement (which amount the Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Securityholders) acknowledges is a Company Transaction Expense under the
Merger Agreement). The obligations of each of Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative under this Section 18 to compensate the Escrow Agent and to pay
or reimburse the Escrow Agent for the reasonable fees and expenses shall
survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Agreement or the earlier
resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

19\. _Resignation of Escrow Agent_.

(a) If the Escrow Agent at any time, in its sole discretion, deems it
necessary or advisable to resign as Escrow Agent hereunder, it may do so by
giving at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of such event to
Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative and thereafter delivering the
Escrow Fund to any other escrow agent mutually agreed upon by Acquiror and the
Stockholder Representative as notified to the Escrow Agent in writing, and if
no such escrow agent shall be designated by Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative within sixty (60) calendar days after such written notice, then
the Escrow Agent may designate such by delivering the Escrow Fund either (i)
to any bank or trust company located in New York, New York that is willing to
act as escrow agent hereunder in its place on the terms set forth herein, or
(ii) if no such bank or trust company can be retained within a reasonable
period after such sixty (60) calendar day period after the delivery by the
Escrow Agent of its written notice, the Escrow Agent may deliver the Escrow
Fund to the clerk or other proper officer of a court of competent  



 

10  jurisdiction located within the State of New York in the manner permitted by
applicable law (any such successor to the Escrow Agent, whether designated
by Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative or pursuant to clause (i) or
(ii) above or otherwise, hereinafter referred to as the " _Successor Agent_

the date hereof, agree in writing to substitute a Successor Agent for the
Escrow Agent, whereupon the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Escrow Fund to such
Successor Agent. The fees of any Successor Agent shall be paid as provided in
Section 8\. The resignation of the Escrow Agent shall only be effective upon
delivery of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

(b) Upon delivery of the Escrow Fund to the Successor Agent, (i) the Escrow
Agent shall be discharged from any and all responsibility or liability with
respect to the Escrow Fund (except for liability incurred hereunder pursuant
to the last sentence of Section 19(a) hereof or due to the Escrow Agents
willful misconduct or gross negligence) and (ii) all references herein to the
"Escrow Agent" shall, where applicable, be deemed to include such Successor
Agent, and such Successor Agent shall thereafter become the Escrow Agent for
all purposes of this Agreement (and may be replaced as Escrow Agent by
Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative in the manner provided for in
this Section 19).

20\. _Indemnification of the Escrow Agent_. Acquiror and the Stockholder
Representative, on behalf of the Securityholders and strictly in its capacity
as Stockholder Representative and not as an individual, shall jointly and
severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Escrow Agent and its
directors, officers, agents and employees (the " _Indemnitees_ ") from and
against any and all losses, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable fees
and expenses of outside counsel and experts and their staffs and reasonable
expenses of document location, duplication and shipment but excluding any
fees or expenses allocated to its in-house counsel) arising out of or in
connection with (a) the Escrow Agents execution and performance of this
Agreement, except in the case of any Indemnitee to the extent that any such
loss, liability or expense is caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee, or (b) the Escrow Agents following any joint
instructions or directions from the parties. The parties hereto acknowledge
that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation or removal of
the Escrow Agent.

21\. _Termination of Agreement_. Upon disbursement by the Escrow Agent
(including any Successor Agent) of all of the Escrow Fund pursuant to the

provisions of Sections 18 and 20 hereof shall survive such termination).
