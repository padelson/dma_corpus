Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive
of any other remedy conferred hereby, or at Law or in equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their respective obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly
agreed that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to <U>Section 8.1</U>, on the understanding that termination
pursuant to <U>Section 8.1(d) </U>shall not be deemed &ldquo;valid&rdquo; for purposes of this <U>Section 11.15</U>, the Parties
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including Sellers&rsquo; or Buyer&rsquo;s
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if it is required to do so hereunder), in each case without
posting a bond or other undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity.
Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose or raise any objection to the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other Party
has an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or in equity.
If any Party institutes any legal suit, action or proceeding against the other Party to obtain the remedy of specific performance
as provided in <U>Section 8.2</U> or this <U>Section 11.15</U>, the prevailing Party in such suit, action or proceeding shall
be entitled to receive, and the non-prevailing Party shall pay, in addition to all other remedies to which the prevailing Party
may be entitled, the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing Party in conducting the suit, action or proceeding,
including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses, court costs and other related expenses, even if not otherwise recoverable
by Law; <U>provided</U>, that if the non-prevailing Party has failed to prevail in such action for specific performance on the
basis that such Party had an adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance was not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or in equity and such non-prevailing Party subsequently prevails in a suit or action instituted to enforce such
remedy at Law under this Agreement (the &ldquo;<FONT STYLE="font-weight: normal"><U>Subsequent Action</U></FONT>&rdquo;), such
Party shall be entitled to recover from the other Party all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in unsuccessfully seeking to
enforce its rights for specific performance in addition to those incurred successfully enforcing its rights in the Subsequent
Action.</P>
