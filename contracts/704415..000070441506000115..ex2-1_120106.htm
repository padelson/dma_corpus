Purchaser resolve in writing any differences they have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Objection and (2) the date any matters
in dispute are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the
thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Objection,
Seller and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences that they may have with respect to any matter specified in the
Notice of Objection. During any period of dispute, Seller shall have full
access during reasonable business hours and upon written notice to the working
papers and records of Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company
and their respective representatives relating to the matters described in the
Notice of Objection. At the end of such thirty-day period, Seller and
Purchaser shall submit to the _Accounting Firm_ for review and resolution any
and all matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute and which were
included in the Notice of Objection. Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the
Accounting Firm to review and resolve any and all matters (but only such
matters) which remain in dispute and which were included in the Notice of
Objection. Purchaser and Seller shall instruct the Accounting Firm to make a
final determination of the items included in the Closing Statement (to the
extent such amounts are in dispute) in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement. Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate
with the Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement. The Accounting
Firm shall not assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest
value for such item assigned by Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the
other hand, or less than the smallest value for such item assigned by
Purchaser, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other hand. The Accounting Firm
shall make its determination based solely on presentations made, and other
materials submitted, by Purchaser and Seller that are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the
basis of an independent review). The Closing Statement and the resulting final
Purchase Price shall become final and binding on the parties hereto on the
date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to Purchaser
and Seller (which final resolution shall be delivered, if feasible, not more
than thirty (30) days following submission of such disputed matters). All of
the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this _Section 2.2(b)_
shall be borne by the party ( _i.e._ , Seller, on the one hand, or Purchaser,
on the other hand) that assigned amounts to items in dispute that were, on a
net basis, furthest in amount from the amount finally resolved by the
Accounting Firm in accordance with

  



   

       



  |  

\- 12 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

this _Section 2.2(b)_ , as determined by reference to the final Purchase
Price. (By way of example only of the application of the immediately preceding
sentence: _if_ (x) Seller assigns values to the disputed items submitted to
the Accounting Firm in accordance with this _Section 2.2(b)_ such that the
Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Statement would be increased by
$500,000 if the Accounting Firm resolved all of the submitted disputes in
Seller\'s favor (to the full extent), (y) Purchaser maintains that the
Purchase Price set forth in the Closing Statement is correct and (z)the
Accounting Firm\'s final resolution of the disputed items in accordance with
this _Section 2.2(b)_ is that the Purchase Price is increased from the amount
set forth in the Closing Statement by more than $250,000 (i.e., more than one
half of the difference between the parties\' respective total disputed
amounts), _then_ Purchaser would pay all of the fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm incurred by the parties under this _Section 2.2(b)_ ).

  

(c) If the final Purchase Price (as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.2(b)_ ) is _greater_ _than_ the Estimated Purchase Price, Purchaser
shall pay Seller the amount of the difference. If the final Purchase Price (as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_ ) is _less_ _than_ the
Estimated Purchase Price, Seller shall pay Purchaser the amount of the
difference. Such payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds as follows: (i) if no Notice of Objection is delivered by
Seller, such amount shall be paid within three (3) Business Days of the
earlier of the expiration of the thirty-day period for delivery of such Notice
of Objection and the date of delivery by Seller to Purchaser of a written
notice that the Closing Statement will be accepted without objection; or (ii)
if a Notice of Objection is delivered by Seller, such amount shall be paid
within three (3) Business Days after the date the Purchase Price is finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.2(b)_. Any payments owed to Seller by
Purchaser under this _Section 2.2(c)_ shall be deposited in an account or
accounts designated by Seller. Any payments owed to Purchaser by Seller under
this _Section 2.2(c)_ shall be deposited in an account or accounts designated
by Purchaser. Any amounts not paid when required pursuant to this _Section
2.2(c)_ shall bear interest compounded annually from the required date of
payment to the date of actual payment at the prime rate of interest announced
publicly by Citibank N.A. in New York, New York as of the date most recently
preceding the required date of payment as its base rate.

  

(d) Purchaser agrees that following the Closing it will not take any
actions with respect to the Company\'s and the Company\'s Subsidiaries\'
accounting books, records, policies and procedures for periods up to and
including the Closing Date that have the effect of materially obstructing or
preventing Seller\'s preparation of any Notice of Objection as provided in
this _Section 2.2(d)_.

  

(e) In the event that the aggregate amount of accounts receivable of
the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to the customer set forth on
Schedule 2.2(e) (which accounts as of the date of this Agreement total
approximately $874,351.00), as set forth on _Schedule 2.2(e)_ and reflected on
the Closing Statement (the " _Designated A/R_ ") is in excess of the aggregate
amount actually collected by the Purchaser in respect of such Designated A/R
as of the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date (such uncollected
amount, the " _Uncollected A/R Amount_ "), then Purchaser shall be entitled to
be promptly paid from the Indemnity Escrow Amount an amount equal to the
Uncollected A/R Amount. The amount paid pursuant to the prior sentence shall
not be included within the calculation of the Basket Amount or the Deductible.

(b) Except as described in _Schedule 7.14(b)_ , none of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company is a member of a controlled group of
corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code), any trade or business
under common control (within the meaning of Section 414(c) of the Code) or an
affiliated service group (as defined in Section 414(m) of the Code), and is
not otherwise required to be treated as a single employer with any other
corporation or entity under Section 414(o) of the Code; each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries has materially performed and complied with all of their
respective obligations under or with respect to the Benefit Plans, and each
Benefit Plan materially complies and has been administered and operated in
compliance with its terms and with all applicable Laws, including but not
limited to the Code and ERISA; and all amendments and actions required to
bring each of the Benefit Plans into conformity in all material respects with
all of the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws
have been made or taken except to the extent that such amendments or actions
are not required by Law to be made or taken until a date after the Closing
Date. To the Knowledge of the Company, no individual who has performed
services for the Company and/or its Subsidiaries has been improperly excluded
from participation in any Benefit Plan. Except as set forth on _Schedule
7.14(b)_ , to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no audits or proceedings
initiated pursuant to the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System or
similar proceedings pending with the Internal Revenue Service or the United
States Department of Labor with respect to any Benefit Plan. Except as
described in Schedule 7.14(b), there is no violation of ERISA or the Code with
respect to the filing of applicable reports, documents and notice regarding
the Benefit Plans with the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Treasury or
the furnishing of such documents to the participants or beneficiaries of the
Benefit Plans except for violations which in the aggregate would not have a
Material Adverse Change.

  

(c) None of the Benefit Plans is a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA Affiliates have maintained, been required to
contribute to or been required to pay any amount with respect to a
"multiemployer plan" at any time in the past three years. None of the Benefit
Plans are subject to Title IV of ERISA or to the funding requirements of
Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, and none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of its ERISA Affiliates have ever had any
obligation to or liability for (contingent or otherwise) with respect to any
such Benefit Plan. Each Benefit Plan and its related trust intended to be
qualified under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code, respectively, has so
qualified and has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from
the Internal Revenue Service and, to the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred with respect to such Benefit Plan since the date of such
determination or opinion letter which could cause the loss of such
qualification or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax
under ERISA or the Code. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened Proceeding relating to the Benefit Plans, the assets of
any trust under any Benefit Plan, or the plan sponsor, plan administrator or
any fiduciary of any Benefit Plan with respect to the administration or
operation of such Benefit Plan, other than routine claims for benefits, and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances which
could form the basis for any such Action. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any "party in interest"
or "disqualified person" with respect to any Benefit Plan, has engaged in a
"prohibited transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code with respect to any Benefit Plan that could result in a
material tax or penalty. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Benefit Plan or
any fiduciary of any such Benefit Plan has (i) engaged in any transaction

  



   

       



  |  

\- 31 -

prohibited by ERISA or the Code, (ii) breached any fiduciary duty owed by it
with respect to the Plans, or (iii) engaged in any transaction as a result of

pursuant to Sections 406 or 409 of ERISA or to either a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 502(i) or Section 502(1) of ERISA or a tax imposed
pursuant to Sections 4975 through 4980 of the Code.

  

(d) All contributions and premiums (including all employer
contributions and employee salary reduction contributions) that are due with
respect to any Benefit Plan have been made within the time periods prescribed
by applicable Law or by the terms of such Benefit Plan or any agreement
relating thereto to the respective Benefit Plan, and all contributions,
liabilities or expenses of any Benefit Plan (including workers\' compensation)
for any period ending on or before the Closing Date which are not yet due will
have been paid or accrued on the relevant balance sheet in accordance with
past practice and custom of the Company and its Subsidiaries on or prior to
the Closing Date.

  

(e) Except for health care continuation requirements under Section
4980B of the Code and Part 6 of Subtitle I of ERISA (" _COBRA_ ") or
applicable state law, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
obligations for retiree health or retiree life benefits (whether or not
insured) to any current or former employee or director after his or her
termination of employment or service. All group health plans of the Company or
its Subsidiaries have been operated in compliance with the applicable
requirements of COBRA except for instances of non-compliance which in the
aggregate would not change a Material Adverse Change.

  

(f) Except as provided on _Schedule 7.14(f)_ , the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions will not, either alone or in combination with
any other event, (i)result in any payment becoming due, or increase the amount
of compensation due, to any current or former employee or director of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase any benefits payable under any
Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any such compensation or benefits. Except as specifically provided
herein in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has announced any type of plan or binding
commitment to (i)create any additional Benefit Plan, (ii) enter into any
agreement with any current or former employee or director, or (iii) amend or
modify any existing Benefit Plan or agreement with any current or former
employee or director.

  

(g) _Schedule 7.14(g)_ identifies each Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code and associated Treasury Department guidance, including IRS Notice
2005-1 and Proposed Treasury Regulations at 70 Fed. Reg. 57930 (October 4,
2005) (each a "NQDC Plan"). Each NQDC Plan either (i) has been operated in
full compliance with Code Section 409A since January 1, 2005, or (ii) is not
subject to the requirements of Section 409A.

  

(h) Each Benefit Plan may be amended, terminated, modified or
otherwise revised, as provided in the Benefit Plan, other than benefits
protected under Section 411(d) of the Code, on and after the Closing, without
further liability to the Company (excluding ordinary administrative expenses
and routine claims for benefits).

(a) _Schedule 7.15(a)_ sets forth a true, correct and complete list

respect to its material obligations under any such insurance policy. None of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of
cancellation or termination in respect of any such policy.

  

(b) All such polices provide insurance coverage for the properties,
assets and operations of each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and no such
policy provides for or is subject to any currently enforceable material
retroactive rate or premium adjustment or loss sharing arrangement. No notice
of cancellation or termination has been received by Seller, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to any such policy. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries has duly and timely made all material claims it has been
entitled to make under each such policy of insurance during the last two (2)
years. All general liability policies maintained by or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the last two (2) years have been
"occurrence" policies and not "claims made" policies. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there is no claim pending under any such policies as to which
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such
policies. _Schedule 7.15_ describes any self-insurance arrangements affecting
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. Except as disclosed in _Schedule
7.15_ , the reserves established by the Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company and reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet are adequate to dispose of
any liability under such self-insurance arrangements.

Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to Seller that except as set forth in
a Schedule corresponding in number to the applicable Section of this _Article
8_ ( _provided_ _that_ the disclosure of an item in one section of the
Schedules shall be deemed to modify both (i)the representations and warranties
contained in the section of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number
and (ii)any other representation and warranty of Purchaser in this Agreement
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from a reading of such disclosure
item that it would also qualify or apply to such other representation and
warranty):

  

8.1 _Organization and Good Standing_. Purchaser is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the

corporate action on the part of Purchaser and do not constitute or result in a
breach or violation of or default under the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws of Purchaser. The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of
each of Purchaser Documents, and the consummation by Purchaser of the
Contemplated Transactions (a) do not require the consent, waiver, approval,

trust, indenture or other agreement or instrument or any Law or Order or any
other restriction of any kind or character to which Purchaser is a party or by
which any of its assets or properties may be bound, the consequence of which
violation, conflict, breach, termination or default referred to in this clause
(d) would be reasonably expected to materially adversely affect the ability

other proceeding by or before any Governmental Body pending or, to the
knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against Purchaser, nor to the knowledge of

Transactions or otherwise prevent Purchaser from complying with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

8.5 _No Brokers or Finders_. Other than Merrill Lynch, Purchaser has

\- 42 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

(a) _General_. Subject to the specific mechanisms of this _Section
9.3_ , the Seller shall be responsible for all Tax liabilities of the Company
and its Subsidiaries for taxable periods, or portions thereof, ending on or
before the Closing Date and the portion of the Taxes for any Straddle Period
that are allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date and any Taxes arising as a result of the payment of any "excess
parachute payments" as defined in Section 280G of the Code made in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions.

  

(i) The Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date with respect to which a Tax Return was not due on or
before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Returns_ ") and any Tax Returns of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to a period beginning before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") (the
" _Straddle Period Returns_ "). The Purchaser shall submit each of the Pre-
Closing Returns and Straddle Period Returns, to Seller for review at least
thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Pre-Closing
Return or Straddle Period Return (taking into account any extensions). The
Seller and the Purchaser agree to consult and resolve in good faith any issues
and comments arising as a result of the review of each Pre-Closing Return and
Straddle Period Return, and mutually to consent to filing as promptly as
possible each Pre-Closing Return and Straddle Period Return; _provided_ _that_
if Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve any such issue within fifteen
(15) days after any such Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Period Return is
submitted to Seller, the dispute shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution in accordance with _Section 2.2_. The Seller shall pay or cause to
be paid to Purchaser (i) with respect to any Pre-Closing Return, all Taxes
reflected on each Pre-Closing Return (as finally determined under this
_Section 9.3(a)_ ) and (ii) with respect to any Straddle Period Return, an
amount equal to the portion of the Taxes for such Straddle Period that are
allocable to the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date
within 15 days after payment of such Taxes by Purchaser.

  

(b) _Carrybacks and Refunds_. Purchaser may, and may cause the
Company or its Subsidiaries to, carry back any item of loss, deduction or
credit which arises in any taxable period of the Company into any prior
taxable period, _provided_ _that_ such carryback, refund claim or related
amended Tax Return does not have the effect of increasing the liability of
Seller for any Taxes or Seller or increasing any obligation of Seller to
Purchaser hereunder or increasing any amount Purchaser is entitled to recover
from Seller hereunder. Seller shall be entitled to any refund or credit of
Taxes attributable to the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
periods ending on or before the Closing Date.

  

(c) _Taxable Period_. If the Company and its Subsidiaries are
permitted under any applicable foreign, state or local income tax law to treat
the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, the Seller and Purchaser
shall treat (and cause their respective Affiliates to treat) the Closing Date
as the last day of a taxable period. For all purposes under this Agreement, in
the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to any Straddle Period, the
portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the portion of the period ending
on the close of the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of Taxes that are
(x) based upon or related to income or receipts, (y) imposed in connection
with the sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal,
tangible or intangible), (z) employment, social security or other similar
taxes, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year
ended on the Closing Date; and (ii) in the case of

  



   

       



  |  

\- 43 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to any assets or otherwise
measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for
the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire period.

  

(d) _Tax Contests_. Purchaser shall inform Seller of the
commencement subsequent to the Closing Date of any audit, examination or
proceeding (" _Tax Contests_ ") relating in whole or in part to Taxes for
which Purchaser may be entitled to indemnity from Seller hereunder and Seller
shall be entitled to control and conduct those aspects of such Tax Contests
that are related exclusively to the liability for any Taxes, the amount of
which is recoverable by Purchaser from Seller hereunder. Costs of any Tax
Contest are to be borne by the party controlling such Tax Contest. With
respect to a Tax Contest which Seller is entitled to control, Seller shall
have the right to determine, in its sole discretion, such issues as (i) the
forum, administrative or judicial, in which to contest any proposed
adjustment, (ii) the attorney and/or accountant to represent the Company in
the Tax Contest, (iii) whether or not to appeal any decision of any
administrative or judicial body, and (iv) whether to settle any such Tax
Contest, except that Seller shall not settle any Tax Contest in a manner that
would have an adverse Tax effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries for
taxable periods ending after the Closing Date without the prior written
consent of Purchaser (which consent may be not be unreasonably withheld. The
Seller shall keep the Purchaser informed through the Tax Contest and the
Purchaser shall be entitled to participate at its sole expense in an such Tax
Contest. Purchaser or the Company, as applicable, shall deliver to Seller any
power of attorney reasonably required to allow Seller and its counsel to
represent the Company in connection with the Tax Contest and shall use their
reasonable efforts to provide Seller with such assistance as may be
reasonably requested by Seller in connection with the Tax Contest.

  

(e) _Elections, Amended Returns, etc_. Without the prior written
consent of Seller (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld), or unless
otherwise required by law, none of Purchaser, the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company or any Affiliate of Purchaser shall (i)make any election, (ii)
change the tax treatment of any item on a Tax Return filed after the Closing
Date as compared to the treatment of such item on a Tax Return filed prior to
the Closing Date, or (iii) file any amended Tax Return or propose or agree to
any adjustment of any item with the Internal Revenue Service or any other
Taxing Authority with respect to any taxable period ending on, before or after
the Closing Date that would (in any such case) have the effect of increasing
Sellers liability for any Taxes, increasing the indemnification obligations
of Seller or increasing the amount recoverable by Purchaser with respect to
Taxes unless Purchaser and any such Affiliate indemnify and hold Seller
harmless from and against any such adverse Tax effect.

  

(f) _Access and Assistance_. The Seller and Purchaser shall, upon
written request of the other, provide the other, and the Purchaser shall cause
the Company to provide the Seller, with such assistance as may be reasonably
requested by any of them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return,
audit, or other examination by any Taxing Authority, any Taxing Authority or
judicial or administrative proceedings relating to liability for Taxes, or any
other claim arising under this Agreement, and each will retain and provide the
other, and the

  



   

       



  |  

\- 44 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

Purchaser shall cause the Company to retain and provide the Seller with, any
records or other information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit or
examination, proceeding or determination. The Seller and Purchaser shall
provide the other with any final determination of any such audit or
examination, proceeding or determination that affects any amount required to
be shown on any Tax Return of the other or the Company for any period. Such
assistance shall include making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder and shall include providing copies of any relevant Tax
Returns and supporting work schedules, which assistance shall be provided
without charge except for reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall retain, and
shall cause the Company to retain, and Seller shall retain, until the
applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions) have expired,
copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules, and other records or
information that may be relevant to such returns for all Tax periods or
portions thereof ending before or including the Closing Date and shall not
destroy or otherwise dispose of any such records without first providing the
other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and copy the same. Each
party shall bear its own expenses in complying with the foregoing provisions.

  

9.4 _Transfer and Similar Taxes_. All real property transfer or
gains Taxes, other transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration, stamp and
similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions
(collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne equally by Seller and
Purchaser. Seller, in the case of Transfer Taxes and corresponding Tax Returns
due on or prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser, in the case of
corresponding Tax Returns due after the Closing Date, shall cause the Company
to remit payment for such Transfer Taxes and duly and timely file such Tax
Returns. Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate in (i) determining the
amount of Transfer Taxes, (ii) providing all requisite exemption certificates,
and (iii) preparing and timely filing any and all required Tax Returns for or
with respect to such Transfer Taxes with any and all appropriate Taxing
Authorities.

  



  

9.5 _Access and Cooperation Following the Closing_. Without
limitation upon the rights of the parties under _Section 9.3_ , following the
Closing Date:

  



  

(a) Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries
to, give Seller and their authorized representatives access to its books and
records (and permit Seller and their authorized representatives to make copies
thereof) to the extent relating to (i) Seller\'s obligations under this
Agreement, (ii) the preparation of the Notice of Objection, or (iii) the
institution or defense of any pending or threatened litigation, investigation
or proceedings, whether in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions or with operations prior to the Closing Date for which Seller is
liable pursuant hereto.

  

(b) Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make their
employees available to Seller, without requiring a subpoena or other legal
process, for reasonable periods of time for the purposes described in
subsection (a) above, with the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of making
such employees available being reimbursed but no reimbursement being required
for the salaries, wages, bonuses or other compensation of such employees
during such periods.

\- 45 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

9.6 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_. For a
period of six (6) years after the Closing, (i) Purchaser shall not and shall
not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries identified on _Schedule 9.6_
(the " _Designated Subsidiaries_ ") (or their successors as a result of any
mergers) to, amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Company\'s or its
Designated Subsidiaries\' governance or other documents relating to
exculpation or indemnification of former officers, directors or manager, in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of such former
officers, directors or managers, unless such amendment repeal or modification
is required by law, it being the intent of the parties that the officers,
directors and managers of the Company and its Designated Subsidiaries prior to
the Closing shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and
indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under the law of its
jurisdiction of formation or incorporation, and (ii) Purchaser shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries (or its successors as a result of any mergers) to
maintain in effect directors\' and officers\' liability insurance with
reputable and financially sound carriers covering the officers and directors
of the Company and the Designated Subsidiaries who are currently covered by
the current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies of the
Seller, the Company or any Designated Subsidiaries with respect to matters
occurring prior to the Closing on terms not less favorable to persons than
those provided under the Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability
insurance as of the date of this Agreement. Purchaser and Seller shall split
and have equal responsibility for all costs, fees and expenses of such
insurance. Without limitation of the preceding portions of this Section, it is
understood and agreed that from and after the Closing, except as expressly set
forth herein, none of Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
will be responsible for providing or maintaining directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance coverage for the benefit of any person other than with
respect to any person who first becomes an officer or director of any of the
Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company after the Closing.
Effective upon the Closing, the Company, for itself and its Subsidiaries,
hereby waives any claims that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries currently
has or, in the future, may have against any employees or representatives of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of such Person\'s actions or
omissions in their capacities as officers or directors of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

9.7 _Compliance with WARN Act_. Purchaser agrees that, for a period
of 60 days after the Closing Date, it will not cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries to, effectuate (i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act)
affecting any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units
within any site of employment or facility of the Company and its Subsidiaries;
(ii) a "mass layoff"(as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of
employment or facility of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (iii) an
"employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) which could create any
liability for Seller under the WARN Act, unless Purchaser or the Company
delivers notices under the WARN Act in such a manner and at such a time that
Seller bears no liability with respect thereto.

  



  

9.8 _Schedule Updates_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, each of the Company and Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser
in writing if it becomes aware of any fact or condition that causes or
constitutes a breach of any of its representations or warranties, or if it
becomes aware of the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact
or condition that would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement)
cause or constitute a breach of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made

\- 46 -

as of the time of occurrence or discovery of such fact or condition. Should
any such fact or condition reported in such written notice require any change
in Seller\'s or the Company\'s Schedules if such Schedules were dated the date
of the occurrence or discovery of any such fact or condition, Seller or the
Company will promptly deliver to Purchaser a supplement to the appropriate
Schedules specifying such change. Purchaser shall be entitled to reject any of
the supplemental disclosures made pursuant to this _Section 9.8_ in asserting
that the condition to Closing set forth in _Section 4.2(a)_ has not been
satisfied. If Purchaser fails to reject the supplemental disclosure in the
Schedules in writing within five (5) Business Days following Purchaser\'s
receipt thereof, or if Purchaser elects to close despite such supplemental
disclosures, the supplemental disclosures shall be deemed accepted by
Purchaser, the condition to Closing set forth in Section 4.2(a) shall be
deemed satisfied and the disclosure relative to Seller\'s or Company\'s
representations and warranties shall be deemed modified and supplemented as
indicated in such notice for purposes of Article 11 hereof.

and be of no further force and effect.

  

(b) Subject to the proviso contained in _Section 9.9(b)_ , Seller
shall not disclose or make use of, and shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all of its officers, directors, employees (excluding any
employee or officer that becomes an employee of Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates), representatives and advisors, not to disclose or make use of any
knowledge, information or documents of a confidential nature, (i) with respect

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Each of the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and use commercially
reasonable efforts to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws or otherwise to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on or before December 1, 2006,
including, without limitation, using its commercially reasonable efforts to

foregoing, Seller and the Company shall cooperate reasonably with the
Purchaser and otherwise shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
the Purchaser with such information as the Purchaser or its lenders may
reasonably request in connection with the Purchasers efforts to obtain the
financing for the Contemplated Transactions. From and after the Closing,
Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to collect the Designated
A/R and to the extent not inconsistent with its customary accounts receivable
collection practices will use the existing employees of the Company that whose
current job function includes collection of the Designated A/R, for so long as
such persons remain employees of the Purchaser or the Compay. In case at any
time after the Closing Date any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper officers and directors of
each party to this Agreement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take
all such action.

  

(b) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, each of
the parties shall promptly notify the other in writing of any pending or, to
the knowledge of such party, threatened action, proceeding or investigation by
any Governmental Body or any other Person (i)challenging or seeking damages in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions or (ii)seeking to restrain or
prohibit the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions or otherwise limit
the right of Purchaser to own or operate all or any portion of the business or
assets of the Company. Purchaser shall keep Seller informed on a regular
ongoing basis of the status of the financing of the Contemplated Transactions.

  

9.11 _Public Announcements_. No party hereto shall issue any press
release or make any public announcement with respect to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions without the prior written consent of the other
Parties hereto (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided,
however, that each Party hereto may make any disclosure or announcement which
such party, in the opinion of its legal counsel, is obligated to make by Laws
or the rules of any securities exchange; in such case, the party desiring to
issue the press releases or make the public announcement shall consult with
the other party hereto prior to issuing the press releases

_Earnout Payments_. 

---|---|--- 
 

  

(a) Purchaser shall provide Seller with copies of all notices,
correspondence and deliveries pertaining to the Earnout Obligations within
five (5) Business Days of their transmission or receipt by Purchaser, the
Company or any of their Affiliates or representatives. In furtherance of the
foregoing, at least five (5) Business Days in advance of delivery to the
Seller Representative of an Earnout Statement under the Harris HealthTrends
Purchase Agreement or My ePhit Purchase Agreement, Purchaser shall provide
Seller a draft Earnout Statement for Seller\'s review. Seller shall have full
access during reasonable business hours to the working papers of Purchaser,
the Company or any of their Affiliates or representatives relating to the
applicable Earnout Statement and the calculations set forth therein. Unless
Seller, within five (5) Business Days **** after receipt of the draft Earnout
Statement gives Purchaser a notice objecting thereto and specifying the basis
for each such objection (a "Seller Earnout Objection"), such Earnout Statement
shall be deemed acceptable to Seller. If a timely Seller Earnout Objection is
received by Purchaser, then the Earnout Statement (as revised in accordance
with clause (1) or (2) below) shall become final and binding upon the parties
on the earlier of (1) the date the Seller and Purchaser resolve in writing any
differences they have with respect to any matter specified in the Seller
Earnout Objection and (2) the date any matters properly in dispute are finally
resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm. During the ten (10) Business Days
immediately following the delivery of a Seller Earnout Objection, the Seller
and Purchaser shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences
that they may have with respect to any matter specified in the Seller Earnout
Objection. At the end of such 10 Business Day period, the Seller and Purchaser
shall submit to the Accounting Firm for review and resolution of any and all
matters (but only such matters) which remain in dispute and which were
properly included in the Seller Earnout Objection. Purchaser and the Seller
shall instruct the Accounting Firm to review and resolve any and all matters
(but only such matters) which remain in dispute and which were properly
included in the Seller Earnout Objection. Purchaser and the Seller shall
instruct the Accounting Firm to make a final determination of the items
included in the Earnout Statement in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this _Section 9.12_. Purchaser and the Seller will
cooperate with the Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement.
Purchaser and the Seller shall instruct the Accounting Firm not to assign a
value to any item in dispute greater than the greatest value for such item
assigned by Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller, on the other hand, or
less than the smallest value for such item assigned by Purchaser, on the one
hand, or the Seller, on the other hand. Purchaser and the Seller shall also
instruct the Accounting Firm to make its determination based solely on
presentations by Purchaser and the Seller that are in accordance with the
guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the
basis of an independent review). The Earnout Statement and the resulting
Earnout Payment shall become final and binding on the parties hereto on the
date the Accounting Firm delivers its final resolution in writing to Purchaser
and the Seller (which final resolution shall be requested by the parties to be
delivered not more than 30 days following submission of such disputed
matters). The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand,
shall bear the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this
_Section 9.12(a)_ based on the percentage which the portion of the disputed
amount not awarded to each

  



   

       



  |  

\- 49 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

Party bears to the amount actually disputed by each Party. The example used at
the end of _Section 2.2(b)_ hereof shall be an illustration of the principle
described in the preceding sentence.

  

(b) If a Seller Representative delivers an Earnout Objection pursuant
to the Harris HealthTrends Purchase Agreement or My ePhit Purchase Agreement,
Purchaser shall provide Seller with copies of all notices, correspondence and
deliveries pertaining to the Earnout Objection within two (2) Business Days of
their transmission or receipt by Purchaser, the Company or any of their
Affiliates or representatives. No settlement of an Earnout Objection (other
than pursuant to a binding determination made by the Accounting Firm in
accordance with the procedures for an Earnout Objection contained in the
Harris HealthTrends Purchase Agreement or My ePhit Purchase Agreement) may be
effected without Seller\'s prior written consent, such consent to not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

(c) Any payment of amounts owed by Purchaser under the My ePhit
Earnout Obligations shall be shared equally by Purchaser and Seller, provided
that Seller\'s obligation shall not exceed $3,750,000. Upon the My ePhit
Escrow Termination Date, an amount equal to $3,750,000 less the amount, if
any, withdrawn pursuant to the Earnout Escrow Agreement to fund Seller\'s
obligations pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence shall be released
to Seller.

  

(d) Any payment of amounts owed by Purchaser under the Harris
HealthTrends Earnout Obligations shall be shared equally by Purchaser and
Seller, provided that Seller\'s obligation shall not exceed $5,250,000. Upon
the Harris HealthTrends Escrow Termination Date, an amount equal to $5,250,000
less the amount, if any, withdrawn pursuant to the Earnout Escrow Agreement to
fund Seller\'s obligations pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
shall be released to Seller.

  

(e) Seller\'s obligations to contribute to payment of the Earnout
Obligations shall be funded solely out of, and shall not exceed, the Earnout
Escrow Amount (but not the earnings thereon). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, no claims shall be made against the Earnout Escrow
Amount other than for Sellers payment of its obligations under this Section
9.12. Purchaser may not amend or waive any of the Earnout Obligations without
Seller\'s prior written consent.

  

(f) Purchaser and Seller hereby agree that (i) compensation to John
Harris in excess of $150,000 annually pursuant to the terms of his employment
agreement with Purchaser shall be excluded from, and shall not be deemed an
expense for purposes of, determining the Harris HealthTrends Earnout
Obligations and the Business EBITDA for purposes thereof.

  

(g) Purchaser and Seller hereby agree that from and after the Closing
for purposes of the Harris HealthTrends Purchase Agreement, "Purchaser", as
defined therein, shall not include Seller solely for purposes of the Harris
HealthTrends Earnout Obligations.

  

9.13 _Special Bonus Program_. Purchaser shall assume all obligations
for payment in 2007 of all bonus amounts earned under the Special Bonus
Program (as a result of the Company\'s achieving the bonus payment targets set
forth in, and in accordance with, the terms of the Special Bonus Program) in
the aggregate maximum amount not to exceed $3,000,000, by the

  



   

       



  |  

\- 50 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

participants and in the maximum amount listed opposite such participant\'s
name on _Schedule 9.13_ ;provided however, that if the Special Bonus Program
is amended after the date of this Agreement or the maximum bonus pool
thereunder is otherwise increased prior to Closing, Seller shall be
responsible for and hereby agrees to make payment of all bonus amounts in
excess of $3,000,000. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall not be
responsible for any amounts owed as a result of modifications to the Special
Bonus Program made by Purchaser or its Affiliates after the Closing Date.
Seller hereby covenants and agrees that it will not modify or amend the
Special Bonus Program as in effect on the date hereof or permit additional
persons to participate in, or increase the potential amounts payable to any
person under the Special Bonus Program.

  



  

9.14 _Indemnification under Prior Purchase Agreements_. In the event
that Seller or any of its Affiliates shall notify Purchaser that it is
considering or investigating a potential indemnification claim under the Prior
Purchase Agreements, Purchaser shall provide reasonable cooperation to Seller
and Sellers Affiliates in connection with the consideration, investigation
and making of such a claim, including without limitation permitting Seller and
its Affiliates to act as an agent on behalf of Purchaser or the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries with respect to such claims, it being acknowledged that in
the pursuit of any collection efforts, including the pursuit of amounts under
any remaining escrow arrangements securing indemnification obligations under
the Prior Purchase Agreements, Purchasers obligations shall be limited to
permitting Seller and its Affiliates to act as an agent as described above.
Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries may amend or waive any of the
rights (including third-party beneficiary rights) or obligations of Seller
under the Prior Purchase Agreements without Sellers prior written consent.

  

9.15 _Axia Strategies Litigation_. Subject to the limitations contained
herein, Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for Damages
incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of the litigation
matter involving Axia Strategies, Inc. set forth on _Schedule 6.6_ hereto (the
" _Axia Strategies Matter_ "). In consideration of the foregoing, (i) within
five (5) Business Days of the Closing (it being acknowledged and agreed that
the use by Purchaser of the name "Axia" and any forms or derivations thereof
during such five (5) Business Day period is under license from Seller for good
and valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby
acknowledged), Purchaser shall cause the names of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries to be changed and thereafter specifically disclaims any rights to
the name "Axia" and any forms or derivations thereof, other than in any
correspondence which by necessity must refer to the pre-Closing name of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) except as expressly set forth in (i) above,
none of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall use the name "Axia" in any
form or derivation thereof or in any respect on or after the Closing Date,
(iii) except as expressly set forth in (i) above, Seller shall not be
obligated to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any Damages
incurred as a result of such use, and (iv) Purchaser shall indemnify the
Seller Indemnified Parties for any Damages incurred by any Seller Indemnified
Party as a result of any such use not permitted in (i) above. Section 11.3
shall not apply to this Section. Seller shall be entitled to control the Axia
Strategies Matter and its defense, compromise or settlement in all respects,
and, subject to the following sentence, no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to consent to any such settlement or compromise. The Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be bound by any such compromise or settlement (and,
to the extent requested by Seller, shall join such settlement documents),
including any requirements imposed by such compromise or

  



   

       



  |  

\- 51 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

settlement to cease and desist use of the "Axia" name or any derivation or
form thereof; provided, however that no Purchaser Indemnified Party shall be
bound by, and each such Purchaser Indemnified Party shall have the right to
consent to, any compromise or settlement that that does not expressly and
unconditionally release such Purchaser Indemnified Party from all liabilities
other than the obligation to cease and desist from the use of the name "Axia"
or any derivations therefrom. For avoidance of doubt, the Sellers
indemnification obligations under this Section 9.15 shall be subject to the
Purchaser Indemnification Cap but not the Basket Amount and the
indemnification obligations of the Purchaser under this Section 9.15 shall be
subject to the Seller Indemnification Cap but not the Basket Amount.

10.6 _Liquidated Damages for Failure to Close by Target Closing Date_.
In the event the Closing of the Contemplated Transactions does not occur on or

satisfy its obligations hereunder, and at such time each of the closing
conditions set forth in Section 4 hereof have been satisfied (except that any
required documents, instruments or signatures may be delivered to Purchaser or
its counsel into escrow pending only Purchaser satisfying its obligations
hereunder) and each of Seller and the Company is on the Target Closing Date
ready, willing and able (in accordance with the terms hereof and without any
waiver by Purchaser) to consummate the Contemplated Transactions, Seller shall
receive, as liquidated damages for and in full settlement of all claims
against Purchaser in connection with Purchaser\'s failure to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions on or prior to the Target Closing Date, an amount
equal to one million dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Liquidated Damages Amount_
") in immediately available funds within one (1) Business Day of demand by

  



   

       



  |  

\- 55 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

Seller to an account designated by Seller. Purchasers payment of the
Liquidated Damages Amount shall only entitle Purchaser to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions at any time on or prior to the Termination Date in
accordance with the terms hereof, and shall not entitle Purchaser to any other
legal rights or protections, and such payment shall not limit any of Sellers
remedies hereunder (other than in respect of the failure to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions on or prior to the Target Closing Date); provided,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, during the period from the
Target Closing Date to the Termination Date, if Purchaser shall have paid the
Liquidated Damages Amount as described above (or Seller shall have not yet
made demand for such Liquidated Damages Amount after becoming entitled to make
such demand, or has made such demand, but the one (1) Business Day period
for payment of the Liquidated Damages Amount has not yet expired), Seller
shall not be entitled, as a result of Purchasers failure to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions, to terminate this Agreement prior to the
Termination Date other than pursuant to Sections 12.1 (a), (c) or (e) or to

11.2 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants;
Limitations_. The representations, warranties and covenants of the Company,

subject to the limitations in this _Section 11.2_.

indemnification or otherwise) for a breach of any representation or warranty
or covenant unless such party is given written notice in accordance with
_Section 13.6_ asserting a claim with respect thereto and specifying the
factual basis of the claim, the provisions of this Agreement that provide a
right of indemnification, and the extent of the Damages in reasonable detail
based on the information at the time available to the party seeking
indemnification, on or before the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, except
that (i) there shall be no time limit for (A) any claim by Purchaser under
_Section 11(a)(i)_ for breach of the representations by Seller or the Company
in _Sections 6.1_ , _6.2_ , _7.1(c)_ or _7.2_ (the "
_Title/Organization/Authority Representations_ ") or (B) any claim by

limitations, and (iii) any claim under _Section 11(a)(ii)_ or _11.1(b)(ii)_
for breach of any covenant that by its terms survives the Closing shall
survive in accordance with the terms of such covenant (collectively, " _Post-
Closing Covenant Claims_ ").

  

(b) _Dollar Limitations - Minimum_. Seller shall not be liable to
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for indemnification under Section 11.1
unless and then only to the extent that the aggregate Damages incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceeds One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00) (the
" _Deductible_ "). In addition, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be liable
to the other (or to the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Seller
Indemnified Parties, as the case may be) for indemnification under _Section
11.1_ , unless and until the aggregate Damages incurred by such party exceeds
$4,500,000 (the " _Basket Amount_  "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event that such Damages exceed the Basket Amount, (i) Seller shall, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Article 11, fully indemnify the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties for all Damages incurred by such Purchaser Indemnified
Parties, including the Basket Amount, that exceed the Deductible, and (ii)
Purchaser shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this Article 11,
fully indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for all Damages incurred by
such Seller Indemnified Parties, including the Basket Amount. Notwithstanding

result of (i) any intentional misrepresentation or fraud by Seller or the
Company or the Purchaser, (ii) any breach of any Title/Organization/Authority
Representation, (iii) any Tax Claims, (iv) any Post-Closing Covenant Claim, or

(c) _Dollar Limitations - Maximum_. Subject to _Section 11.2(b)_ ,
the maximum aggregate liability of Seller to Purchaser and the other Purchaser
Indemnified Parties under this Agreement, including but not limited to
liability under _Section 11.1_ , shall be an amount equal to $35,000,000 (the
" _Purchaser Indemnification Cap_ "), and recovery from the Indemnity Escrow
Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties for such Damages subject to the Purchaser Indemnification Cap.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser Indemnification Cap shall not
apply to Damages arising as a result of (i)any intentional misrepresentation
or fraud by Seller or the Company, (ii) any breach of any of the
representations in _Sections 6.1_ and _7.2_ , (iii) any Tax Claims or (iv) any
claim under Section 11.1(a)(iii) or (iv), for which Seller\'s maximum
aggregate liability, when combined with liability for Damages that are subject
to the Purchaser Indemnification Cap, shall be the cash proceeds received by
Seller pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to _Section 11.2(b)_ , the maximum
aggregate liability of Purchaser to Seller and the other Seller Indemnified
Parties under this Agreement, including but not limited to liability under
_Section 11.1_ , shall be an amount equal to $35,000,000 (the " _Seller
Indemnification Cap_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller
Indemnification Cap shall not apply to Damages arising as a result of (i) any
intentional misrepresentation or fraud by Purchaser or (ii) any claim under
Section 11.1(b)(iii), for which Purchaser\'s maximum aggregate liability, when
combined with liability for Damages that are subject to the Seller
Indemnification Cap, shall be the cash proceeds received by Seller pursuant to
this Agreement.

---|--- 
 

  



      

(a) _Third Party Claims_. In the event that, subsequent to the
Closing, any person or entity entitled to indemnification under this Agreement
(an " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives notice of the assertion of any claim or
of the commencement of any action or proceeding by any Person who is not a
party to this Agreement or otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder as
a Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party (including, but not
limited to any Governmental Body) (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") against such
Indemnified Party, for which a claim is to be made by an Indemnified Party
under this Agreement (an " _Indemnifying Party_ "), the Indemnified Party
shall give written notice regarding such claim to the Indemnifying Party
within fifteen (15) Business Days after learning of such claim. Other than
with respect to a claim involving Taxes, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party (the " _Defense Notice_ ")
within fifteen (15) days Business Days after receipt from the Indemnified
Party of notice of such claim, which notice by the Indemnifying Party shall
specify the counsel it will appoint to defend such claim (" _Defense Counsel_
"), to conduct at its expense the defense against such claim in its own name,
or if necessary in the name of the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to approve the Defense Counsel,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

(i) In the event that the Indemnifying Party shall fail to give the
Defense Notice within said fifteen (15)-Business Day period, it shall be
deemed to have elected not to conduct the defense of the subject claim, and in
such event the Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct the defense
in good faith and to compromise and settle the claim in good faith and the
Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable costs, expenses,
settlement amounts or other Damages paid or incurred in connection therewith;
provided, however, that no such compromise or settlement shall be effected
without the prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) of the Indemnifying Party if, pursuant to or as a result of such
compromise or settlement, (A) injunctive relief or specific performance would
be imposed against the Indemnifying Party, or (B) if the Indemnifying Party is
also named as a party to such claim, such compromise or settlement does not
expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnifying Party from all
liabilities and obligations to the third party claimant (without limitation of
the Indemnified Partys rights against the Indemnifying Party hereunder) with
respect to such claim, without prejudice.

  

(ii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party does deliver a Defense
Notice and thereby elects to conduct the defense of the subject claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to have the exclusive control over said
defense settlement of the subject claim and the Indemnified Party will
cooperate with and make available to the Indemnifying Party such assistance
and materials as it may reasonably request, all at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right at its
expense to participate in the defense assisted by counsel of its own choosing.
In such an event, the Indemnifying Party will not settle the subject claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld if, pursuant to or as a result of such
compromise or settlement, (A) injunctive relief or specific performance would
be imposed against the Indemnifying Party, or (B) would impose a material
amount of liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing,
the Indemnifying Party\'s delivery of a Defense Notice shall constitute an
acceptance of the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified

  



   

       



  |  

\- 59 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

Party with respect to all Damages, if any, resulting from the subject claim;
_provided_ , _however_ if during the course of the defense the Indemnifying
Party reasonably determines that is should not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for the Third Party Claim that is the subject of the Defense Notice and
, either in such Defense Notice or thereafter, promptly notifies the
Indemnified Party in writing of such determination setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis therefor, and each of the conduct of the defense by the
Indemnifying Party and any proposed transition of the defense to the
Indemnified Party has not prejudiced the Indemnified Party in any material
manner, then the initial delivery of the Defense Notice by the Indemnifying
Party shall not be deemed to have constituted such acceptance.

  

(iii) Without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party which
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Indemnifying Party will not
enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim or cease to defend against
such claim, if pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or cessation, (A)
injunctive relief or specific performance would be imposed against the
Indemnified Party, or (B) such settlement or cessation would impose a material
amount of liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

  

(iv) Notwithstanding _Section 11.3(a)(ii)_ , the Indemnifying Party
shall not be entitled to control, but may participate in, and the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement
of any claim (A) that seeks a temporary restraining order, a preliminary or
permanent injunction or specific performance against the Indemnified Party,
(B) that involves criminal allegations against the Indemnified Party, (C) that
if unsuccessful, could be reasonably expected to materially interfere with, or
have a material adverse effect on, the business or financial condition of the
Indemnified Party, or (D) that imposes any material amount **** of liability
on the part of the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder. In such an event, the Indemnifying
Party will still have all of its obligations hereunder provided that the
Indemnified Party will not settle the subject claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.

  

(v) Any final judgment entered or settlement agreed upon in the
manner provided herein shall be binding upon the Indemnifying Party, and shall
conclusively be deemed to be an obligation with respect to which the
Indemnified Party is entitled to prompt indemnification hereunder to the
extent otherwise within the scope of the indemnification provisions of this
Article 11.

  

(vi) A failure by an Indemnified Party to give timely, complete or
accurate notice as provided in this _Section 11.3_ will not affect the rights
or obligations of any party hereunder except and only to the extent that, as a
result of such failure, any party entitled to receive such notice was deprived
of its right to recover any payment under its applicable insurance coverage or
was otherwise directly and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure
to give timely notice.

  

(b) _Non-Third Party Claims_. In the event an Indemnified Party has
a claim against an Indemnifying Party hereunder which does not involve a Third
Party Claim (a " _Direct_ 

  



   

       



  |  

\- 60 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

 _Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall transmit to the Indemnifying Party a
written notice in accordance with the requirements of _Section 11.2(a)_ and
_Section 13.6._

  

11.4 _Calculation of Damages_. The amount of Damages payable by an
Indemnifying Party under this Article 11 shall be reduced by (a) the amount of
any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Party from third party
insurers with respect to such Damages or the underlying factors with respect
thereto or received by the Indemnified Party pursuant to the indemnity
provisions of the Prior Purchase Agreements (there being no obligation on the
part of Purchaser or Seller to pursue same, except to the extent provided in
Section 9.14) and (b) the net present value of any Tax benefits realized by
the Indemnified Party to the extent the claim for which indemnification is
sought gives rise to a deductible loss or expense. Except with regard to
indemnification for claims actually paid or payable to third parties, Damages
payable by an Indemnifying Party under this _Article 11_ shall not include
punitive damages, consequential damages, damages related to mental or
emotional distress, exemplary damages, special damages, lost profits,
diminution in value or other indirect or incidental damages. Any indemnity
payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for Tax purposes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, Purchaser shall have no right to indemnification under this
_Article 11_ with respect to any Damage or alleged Damage if any reserve with
respect thereto was included on the Closing Statement the Interim Financial
Statements or Audited Financial Statements (but only to the extent of such
reserve).

  



  

11.5 _Payments._ In the event that the Indemnity Escrow Account
contains insufficient funds to satisfy in full any claim or portion thereof to
be paid to any Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article 11, such
payment shall be made by the Seller (i) if the claim is not being contested,
not later than thirty (30) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of
written notice from the Indemnified Party stating the amount of the claim or
(ii) if the claim is contested pursuant to this Article 11, five (5) Business
Days after the resolution of any claim contested pursuant to this Article 11.

  



  

11.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, any claim or cause of action (whether such claim sounds in
tort, contract or otherwise, and including statutory rights and remedies)
based upon, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions or otherwise in respect of the status, operations, condition or
ownership of the Company, its Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses or
properties on or prior to the Closing Date must be brought by either Purchaser
or Seller in accordance with the provisions and applicable limitations of this
Article 11, which shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of Purchaser,
Seller and their respective Affiliates, successors and assigns and all Persons
who may claim any rights through Purchaser or Seller, for any such claim or
cause of action, provided, that nothing herein shall limit the parties rights
or remedies under Section 13.5. The provisions of this Article 11 were
specifically bargained for and reflected in the amounts payable to Seller in
connection with the purchase and sale of the Shares pursuant to Article 2.

  



  

11.7 _Seller Acknowledgment._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in herein, Seller hereby waives any and all defenses with respect to
its indemnification obligations hereunder on the ground that Seller was
unaware of or otherwise misled by any representation,

  



   

       



  |  

\- 61 - 

---|--- 
 

  



      

warranty, covenant or other statement, act or omission, whether or not
fraudulent or an act of intentional misconduct, by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
Affiliates.

right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 12.1(b)_ shall not be
available to either party whose material misrepresentation, breach of warranty
or failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the
principal cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Termination Date; or

  

(c) by Seller if there is or has been a material breach or material
default on the part of the Purchaser of any of the representations and
warranties contained herein or in the due and timely performance and

Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become

warranty, covenant or agreement, then the liabilities and obligations of the
party or parties not in such violation or breach shall terminate and the party

_MISCELLANEOUS_. 

---|--- 
 

  

13.1 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement, including all
schedules and exhibits, contains, and is intended as, a complete statement of
all of the terms and the arrangements between the parties with respect to the
matters provided for, supersedes any previous agreements and understandings
between the parties with respect to those matters (except for the
Confidentiality Agreement), and cannot be changed or terminated orally. This
Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented except by written
agreement of the parties hereto. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
neither Seller nor the Company, nor any other Person acting on behalf of
Seller or the Company or any of their respective Affiliates or Subsidiaries,
has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, at law or in
equity, as to the accuracy or completeness of any information furnished or
made available to Purchaser and its representatives regarding the Company, the
Company\'s Subsidiaries, or their respective businesses or assets, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Schedules hereto. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except to the extent such
information or data is expressly set forth in a representation or warranty in
this Agreement or schedule to a representation or warranty, Seller and the
Company hereby disclaim any representation or warranty with respect to, and
Purchaser hereby affirms that it has not relied upon, any information or data
heretofore provided to Purchaser, whether in writing or orally, in separate
presentations, in "data rooms" or in "virtual data rooms" or memoranda, by
Seller, the Company, any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or any representatives
or employees thereof. In connection with Purchaser\'s investigation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, Purchaser has received from or on behalf of the
Company and its Subsidiaries certain projections, including projected
statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2006 and December
31, 2007 and for subsequent fiscal years, and certain business plan
information for such fiscal years and succeeding fiscal years. Except to the
extent expressly set forth in a representation or warranty in this Agreement
or a schedule to a representation or warranty, Purchaser acknowledges that
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans, that Purchaser is familiar with
such uncertainties, that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making
its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including
the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections
and forecasts), and that Purchaser shall have no claim against Seller or any
other Person with respect thereto. Accordingly, subject to the exception at
the beginning of the immediately preceding sentence neither the Company nor
any other Person makes any representations or warranties whatsoever with
respect to such estimates,

  



   

       



  |  

\- 63 - 

---|--- 
 

      

projections and other forecasts and plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts).

  



  

13.2 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by
any party, the other parties shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions, as such other party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to consummate the Contemplated
Transactions.

COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 13.3(b)_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.

  

(c) CONSENT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS OF DELAWARE.

  

(i) Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, as well as to the jurisdiction of
all courts to which an appeal may be taken from such courts, for the purpose
of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of, or in connection with,

including, without limitation, any proceeding relating to ancillary measures
in aid of arbitration, provisional remedies and interim relief, or any

of the State of Delaware and covenants that such party shall not seek in any
manner to resolve any dispute other than as set forth herein or to challenge
or set aside any decision, award or judgment obtained in accordance with the
provisions hereof.

  

(iii) Each of the parties hereto hereby expressly waives any and all
objections such party may have to venue, including, without limitation, the
inconvenience of such forum, in any of such courts. In addition, each of the
parties consents to the service of process by personal service or any manner
in which notices may be delivered hereunder in accordance with _Section 13.6_.

  

13.4 _Headings_. The section headings contained in this Agreement are
solely for the purpose of reference, are not part of the agreement of the
parties and shall not in any way affect the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. All references in this Agreement to Sections, Schedules and
Exhibits are to sections, schedules and exhibits to this Agreement, unless
otherwise indicated.

  

13.5 _Specific Performance._ The parties hereto acknowledge that
irreparable damage would result if this Agreement and the Transaction
Documents were not specifically enforced, and they therefore consent that the
rights and obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents may be enforced by a decree of specific performance
issued by a court of competent jurisdiction. Such remedy shall, however, not
be exclusive and shall be in addition to any other remedies which any party
may have under this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or otherwise.

  

13.6 _Notices_. All demands, notices, requests, consents and other
communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing
and shall be personally delivered or sent by facsimile machine (with a

Section), reputable commercial overnight delivery service (including Federal

deposit thereof with the U.S. Postal Service as aforesaid. Each party, by
notice duly given in accordance therewith may specify a different address for
the giving of any notice hereunder.

  

13.7 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Except for Purchaser Indemnified Parties and Seller
Indemnified Parties, nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to
create any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not party to
this Agreement. No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or
obligations hereunder may be made by either party (by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other and any attempted
assignment without the required consent shall be void, except that Purchaser
may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to one or more directly or indirectly
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Purchaser, provided that any such assignment
shall not release Purchaser from its obligations hereunder.

  

13.8 _Counterparts; Signatures by Telecopy_. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. Signatures sent by telecopy or PDF file shall constitute
originals.

  

13.9 _Time of Essence_. With regard to all dates and time periods set
forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

  

13.10 _Waiver_. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
extension or waiver of any provision hereof shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. A waiver by a
party of the performance of any covenant, agreement, obligation, condition,
representation or warranty shall not be construed as a waiver of any other
covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty. A
waiver by any party of the performance of any act shall not constitute a
waiver of the performance of any other act or an identical act required to be
performed at a later time.

  

13.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof to any Person or circumstance shall be invalid or
unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by
law.

  

13.12 _Interpretation_. As all parties have participated in the drafting
of this Agreement, any ambiguity shall not be construed against any party as
the drafter.
