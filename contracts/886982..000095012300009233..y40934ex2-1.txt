The Company shall be the surviving limited  liability company in the Merger

applicable law.   (d) Manager. The initial manager of the Surviving LLC

shares of Acquiror Common  Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or
other evidence of  ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger or
otherwise hereunder;  instead, Acquiror shall pay to each holder of Company
Membership  Interests who otherwise would be entitled to a fractional share
of  Acquiror Common Stock an amount in cash (without interest) determined 
by multiplying such fraction by $128.025.   (d) Rights as Members. At the
Effective Time, holders of  Company Membership Interests shall have no rights

agree prior to the Effective Time on which employees shall be granted SLK
RSUs and the number of SLK RSUs to be granted to each such employee. The
Company shall consult with Acquiror regarding which employees should be
granted Retention RSUs and the number of Retention RSUs that should be
granted to each such employee, and after such consultation the Company shall
determine, with Acquiror\'s written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld), which employees shall receive the Retention RSUs and how many
Retention RSUs are allocated to each such employee. Moreover, Acquiror shall
have no obligation to issue Retention RSUs or SLK RSUs to any employee who
has not executed and delivered to Acquiror an agreement in form and substance
approved by Acquiror imposing on such employee confidentiality,
noncompetition and nonsolicitation obligations comparable to those contained
in Annex 3. The issuance and delivery of Retention RSUs and SLK RSUs shall be

practicable. The Excess Shares shall be sold through Goldman, Sachs and Co. in
such manner as Goldman, Sachs and Co. shall determine in its sole discretion.
The Members whose Excess Shares are included in the registration statement
shall pay all of their and Acquiror\'s out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation and filing of the registration statement
and the resale of the Excess Shares. Acquiror may delay any such
filing, effectiveness or offering if Acquiror in good faith believes that
such filing, effectiveness or offering would interfere with a proposed
corporate transaction (including an acquisition or disposition) or offering
of securities by Acquiror or any stockholder or require Acquiror to disclose
material, nonpublic information and will use reasonable best efforts to
effect such filing, effectiveness or offering once such transaction or
offering is completed or abandoned or such information is disclosed.   3.07

without the giving of notice, passage of time or both) pursuant to any  law,
rule or regulation or any judgment, decree, order, or any  governmental or
non-governmental permit, license, franchise or  privilege or any Contract of
it or any of its Affiliates or to which it  or any of its Affiliates or its
or their properties is subject or  bound, (2) constitute a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the  Constitutive Documents of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or  (3) require any consent or approval under any
such law, rule,  regulation, judgment, decree, order, governmental or non-
governmental  permit, license, franchise or privilege or the consent or
approval of  any other party to any such Contract.   (f) Reports. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have timely  filed all reports, registrations,
statements and other filings (other  than those relating to Taxes or Tax
Returns), together with any  amendments required to be made with respect
thereto, that were required  to be filed by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries since December  31, 1998 with (1) the SEC or the CFTC, (2) any
other applicable  Governmental Authorities (other than taxing authorities) or
(3) any  Self-Regulatory Organization (all such reports and statements, 
including the financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto,  being
collectively referred to herein as the "Reports"), including  without
limitation, all reports, registrations, statements and filings  required
under the Securities Laws. Each of the Reports, when filed,  complied (or, if
filed after the date hereof, will comply) as to form  with all applicable
statutes, rules, regulations and orders (whether or  not enforced or
promulgated by the Governmental Authority with which  they were filed) and
did not (or will not) contain any untrue statement  of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be  stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in the  light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.   (g) Financial Statements.   (1)
The Company has delivered to Acquiror copies of each of the audited
consolidated statements of financial condition of the Partnership (including
all related notes and schedules thereto) as of September 30, 1998 and 1999,
and the audited consolidated statements of income, changes in
partner\'s capital and cash flows of the Partnership (including any related
notes   -21-  27  and schedules thereto) for the fiscal years ended
September 30, 1997, 1998 and 1999, and the unaudited consolidated financial
statements of the Partnership as of, and for the fiscal quarters ended, June
30, 1999 and 2000 and the unaudited unconsolidated financial statements of
each of the Subsidiaries of the Partnership that are registered as broker-
dealers under Section 15 of the Exchange Act contained in the Financial and
Operational Combined Uniform Single Reports (each, a "Focus Report") for the
fiscal quarters ended June 30, 1999 and 2000 (collectively, the "Financial
Statements"). Each of the statements of financial condition included in the
Financial Statements fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of the Partnership (or, in the case of the
Focus Reports, of the relevant Subsidiary on an unconsolidated basis) as of
its date, and each of the statements of income and changes in owners\'
capital and cash flows or equivalent statements included in the Financial
Statements fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated results
of operations, changes in owners\' capital and changes in cash flows, as the
case may be, of the Partnership (or, in the case of the Focus Reports, of the
relevant Subsidiary on an unconsolidated basis) for the periods set
forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-
end adjustments and footnote disclosure), in each case in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the
periods involved (except as may be noted therein and except that unaudited
statements may not include notes). As of the Closing Date, the only asset of
the Company will be its general partnership interest in the Partnership, and
the Company will not, except as Previously Disclosed, engage (and will not,
except as Previously Disclosed, have engaged since the date hereof) in any
business other than owning such general partnership interest, and the Company
shall have no liabilities whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined,
determinable or otherwise, other than those directly arising from the
Company\'s ownership of such general partnership interest and the Company
shall not have transferred any liabilities to the Partnership or any other
Subsidiary.   (2) There are no liabilities as of the date hereof of
the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever that are
required to be disclosed on the balance sheet, whether accrued, contingent,
absolute, determined, determinable or otherwise, and there is no existing
condition, situation or set of circumstances known to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to result in such a
liability, other than:   (A) liabilities reflected or reserved  against in
the Financial Statements; and   (B) liabilities arising, in the ordinary 
course of business consistent with past practice,  after the date of the most
recent statement of  financial condition included in the Financial 
Statements that are not and could not reasonably be  expected to be
materially adverse to the Company or  its Subsidiaries.   (3) Since
September 30, 1999, (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with past practice
and (B) there has not occurred any change, occurrence or event, and no
change, occurrence or event has   -22-  28  become reasonably likely,
which has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect
with respect to the Company.   (4) The pricing of securities and loans held
in the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' trading accounts or securities
portfolios and reflected in the financial statements contained in the Focus
Report for the quarter ended June 30, 2000 is consistent with past
practices.   (h) Contracts.   (1) The Company has Previously Disclosed,
and  delivered true and complete copies of, each of the following  Contracts
to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,  by which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound, or to which  its or any of its Subsidiaries\'

business  and consistent with past practice):   (A) the real property
leases relating to its  (i) 220,000 square feet lease for 120 Broadway, New 
York, New York and (ii) 90,000 square feet lease for  its Jersey City, New

for existing or  future borrowing of money or payment of the deferred 
purchase price of property in excess of $10,000,000  (in either case, whether

borrowings with a maturity of less than one (1)  year);   (E) any
application, license, franchise or  other Contract relating to any trademark
and  trademark rights, tradename and tradename rights,  service mark and

exclusive  dealing or that limits the freedom of the Company or  any of its
Affiliates to compete in any line of  business or with any person or in any
area;   (G) any Contract, other than this Agreement  and the Supplemental

of an Owner, (ii) any  other Affiliate of the Company or of an Owner, (iii) 
any person 5% or more of whose outstanding voting  securities are directly or
indirectly owned,  controlled or held with power to vote by the Company  or
any Affiliate of the Company or of an Owner or  (iv) any officer of the
Company or any Affiliate of  the Company or of an Owner or any "associates"
or  members of the "immediate family" (as such terms are  respectively
defined in Rule 12b-2 and Rule 16a-1 of  the Exchange Act) of any such Owner;
or   (H) other than the Supplemental Agreements,  any Member agreement,
voting agreement, voting trust  agreement or similar Contract involving the
interests  of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.   The Company has
made available its forms of  agreements relating to the clearing of futures
or securities  transactions, the custody of assets or the extension of
credit  (a "Clearing Agreement"). Each Clearing Agreement entered into  by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is not modified in  any material
respect from such form of Clearing Agreement that  has been made
available.   Each contract required to be disclosed or made available in 
respect of this Section 5.03(h) is referred to as a "Material  Contract".  
(2) Each Material Contract is a valid and binding  agreement of the Company
(and/or its Subsidiaries party  thereto (and/or its Affiliates in the case of
clause (F)  above)) and, with respect to any such of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries (and/or its Affiliates in the case of clause (F)  above), is in
full force and effect, and none of the Company,  any of its Subsidiaries
(and/or its Affiliates in the case of  clause (F) above) or, as of the date
hereof, to the knowledge  of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and/or
its  Affiliates in the case of clause (F) above), any other party  thereto
is in default under any such Contract and there has  not occurred any event
that, with the lapse of time or the  giving of notice or both, would
constitute such a default (to  the knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with  respect to any event relating to a party other than the 
Company or its Subsidiaries).   -24-  30   (i) Properties;
Securities.   (1) Except as reflected or reserved against in the  Financial
Statements, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries  has good and marketable
title to, or in the case of leased  property, has valid leasehold interests
in all property and  assets purported to be owned or leased by it (whether
real or  personal, tangible or intangible, and including investment 
securities and other investments) reflected in the Financial  Statements or
acquired after the date thereof, except for  property and assets sold or
transferred since such date in the  ordinary course of business consistent
with past practices.  None of such property or assets (except property or
assets  sold or transferred since such date in the ordinary course of 
business consistent with past practices) is subject to any  Liens (including
Tax-related Liens), except:   (A) Liens incurred in the ordinary  course of
business consistent with past practice;   (B) Liens securing liabilities
which,  in each case, are disclosed or reserved against in  the Financial
Statements;   (C) Liens for Taxes not yet due or  payable or being
contested in good faith (and, in  either case, for which adequate accruals or
reserves  have been established in the Financial Statements);   (D)
Mechanics or materialmen liens and  similar liens arising by operation of
law; or   (E) Liens which do not materially  detract from the value or
materially interfere with  any current use of such property or assets.  
(2) To the knowledge of the Company and its  Subsidiaries, all buildings and
all fixtures, equipment, and  other property and assets used but not owned by
the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries are held under valid leases or 
subleases enforceable in accordance with their respective  terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable  bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other  laws affecting creditors\' rights
generally and by general  equity principles.   (3) Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has a  "security entitlement" (as defined in the Uniform
Commercial  Code) in all securities or investments held or purported to be 
held by it (except securities sold under repurchase agreements  or held in
any fiduciary or agency capacity), free and clear  of any Lien, except to the
extent such securities are pledged  in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past  practices to secure obligations of each of the Company
or any  of its Subsidiaries. Such securities are valued on the books  of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with  generally accepted
accounting principles.   -25-  31   (4) All Managing Director
Subordinated Notes, by  their terms, are redeemable by the Company at a price
equal to  the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, if any, 
through the date of such redemption without penalty.   (j) Litigation;
Regulatory Action. Except as Previously  Disclosed, no litigation, proceeding
or investigation ("Litigation")  before or by any court, arbitrator, mediator
or Governmental Authority  is pending against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and, to the  knowledge of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, no such Litigation  has been threatened, and there is no
existing condition, situation or  set of circumstances known to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries  which could reasonably be expected to result in
such litigation;  neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, or any of
their  properties is a party to or is subject to any order, decree,
agreement,  memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement with, or a 
commitment letter or similar submission to, any Self-Regulatory  Organization
or any Governmental Authority (including the SEC, the CFTC  and the Federal
Trade Commission) charged with the supervision or  regulation of broker-
dealers, securities underwriting or trading, stock  exchanges, commodities
exchanges, alternative trading systems or the  supervision or regulation of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  (collectively, "Regulatory Orders").
There is no Litigation involving  the Company, and to the Company\'s
knowledge there are no claims,  disputes or Litigation involving any Member
or former Member, related,  in each case, to the ownership of the membership
interests of the  Company.   (k) Compliance with Laws. Each of the Company
and its  Subsidiaries, and their respective Owners, managers, directors, 
officers and employees:   (1) in the conduct of its businesses has been and
is  in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local and  foreign
statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules,  judgments, orders or decrees
applicable thereto or to the  employees conducting such businesses, and with
the applicable  rules of all Self-Regulatory Organizations including
without  limitation, (w) all applicable regulatory net capital

franchises and approvals are in full  force and effect and, to the Company\'s
and its Subsidiaries\'  knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any of
them is  threatened or reasonably likely; and all such filings,   -26- 
32   applications and registrations are current and do not need to  be
amended in any material respect;   (3) since January 1, 1997, except as
disclosed on the  Partnership\'s or its Affiliates\' most recent Form BD
filed  with the SEC, the Partnership has received no written  notification
or communication (or, to the Company\'s and its  Subsidiaries\' knowledge,
any other communication) from any  Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory
Organization (A)  asserting that any of them is not in compliance with any
of  the statutes, rules, regulations, or ordinances which such  Governmental
Authority or Self-Regulatory Organization  enforces, or has otherwise engaged
in any unlawful business  practice except such assertions that were resolved
to the  satisfaction of such Governmental Authority or Self-Regulatory 
Organization and did not result in a material change to the  operations or
practices of the Company or such Subsidiary, (B)  threatening to revoke any
license, franchise, permit, seat on  any stock or commodities exchange, or
governmental  authorization, (C) requiring any of them (including any of
the  Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' Owners, managers, directors,  officers

similar body) thereof to  adopt any resolution or policy) or (D) restricting
or  disqualifying the activities of the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries

communication to Acquiror;   (4) is not the subject of any pending or aware
of any  threatened investigation, review, disciplinary proceedings or

Organization against or with respect to the  Company, any of its Subsidiaries
or any Owner, manager,  officer, director or employee thereof;   (5) in the
conduct of its business with respect to  employee benefit plans subject to
Title I of ERISA or Section  4975 of the Code ("ERISA Plans"), has not (A)
engaged in any  conduct which would subject it or them to liability under 
Sections 405, 406, 409, 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or Section  4975 of the
Code or (B) engaged in any conduct that could  constitute a crime or
violation listed in Section 411 of ERISA  which could preclude such person
from providing services to  any ERISA Plan;   (6) is not, nor is any
Affiliate of any of them,  subject to a "statutory disqualification" as
defined in  Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act; is not subject to a 
disqualification that would be a basis for censure,  limitations on the
activities, functions or operations of, or  suspension or revocation of, the

government securities dealer under Section 15, Section 15B or  Section 15C of
the Exchange Act; is not, nor are any of their   -27-  33   "principals"

of the provisions of Section 8a  that would permit the CFTC, subject to the
terms of such  section, to refuse to register or to suspend or revoke the 
registration of any of them or their respective principals;  and, to the
Company\'s knowledge, there is no current  investigation, whether formal or
informal, or whether  preliminary or otherwise, that is reasonably likely to
result  in, any such censure, limitations, suspension or revocation; 
and   (7) has not acted as an underwriter of any  securities.   (l)
Registrations.   (1) The Company has previously made available each 
registration of the Company and any of its Affiliates as a  broker-dealer, a
registered representative or a sales person  (or in a similar capacity) with
the SEC, the securities or  commodities commission or similar authority of
any state or  foreign jurisdiction or any Self-Regulatory Organization;
each  such registration is in good standing (to the extent such  concept is
applicable) and in full force and effect; and no  other such registrations
are required in order to permit them  to own and operate their businesses as
presently conducted.   (2) Other than as previously made available, none
of  the Company or its Affiliates, nor any of their respective  Owners,
directors, managers, officers and employees, is  required to be registered as
an investment adviser, investment  company, commodity trading advisor,
commodity pool operator,  futures commission merchant, insurance agent, or
transfer  agent under any United States federal, state, local or foreign 
statutes, laws, rules or regulations (including any of the  Securities
Laws).   (m) Specialist Securities. On the date hereof, the  Partnership
and certain of its Subsidiaries act as the Self-Regulatory  Organization
specialist unit for each security Previously Disclosed.  Except as Previously
Disclosed, the Company has no reason to believe  and has not been advised
that it may be required to cease acting as the  Self-Regulatory Organization
specialist unit for any of such  securities, nor has it agreed to act as the
Self-Regulatory  Organization specialist unit for any other security, nor
will it so  agree without the prior written approval of Acquiror. The Company
will  use its best efforts to retain its status as the Self-Regulatory 
specialist unit for each security Previously Disclosed.   (n) No Brokers.
None of the Company or its Subsidiaries,  or any of their respective
Affiliates, has employed any broker or  finder, or incurred any brokers or
finders commissions or fees, in  connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.   -28-  34   (o) Compensation Plans; ERISA
Matters.   (1) The Company has Previously Disclosed a list of  all
significant employment, consulting, benefit and  compensation plans,
contracts, policies or arrangements and  descriptions of any unwritten plans,
policies or arrangements  covering current or former Members or employees or
consultants  of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Employees") 
and current or former Partners of the Partnership or as to  which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries could have,  directly or indirectly, any
liability, including, but not  limited to, "employee benefit plans" within
the meaning of  Section 3(3) of ERISA, and deferred compensation, stock 
option, stock purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock  based, incentive
and bonus plans and any applicable "change in  control" or similar provisions
in any plan, contract or  arrangement (the "Compensation Plans"). True and
complete  copies of all Compensation Plans, including, but not limited  to,
any trust instruments and insurance contracts forming a  part of any
Compensation Plans, and all amendments thereto  have been provided or made
available to Acquiror. No  Compensation Plan provides for any benefit based
in whole or  in part on the value of any Membership Interest or equity 
interest owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. For  purposes of
this paragraph (1), a Compensation Plan is deemed  significant if (i) it
covers fifty (50) or more individuals or  (ii) it requires annual
contributions or payments by the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
provides annual benefits  aggregating an amount equal to or in excess of
$1,000,000.   (2) All employee benefit plans covering Employees  (the
"Plans"), to the extent subject to ERISA, are in  substantial compliance with
ERISA. Each Plan which is an  "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section  3(2) of ERISA ("Pension Plan") and which is intended to
be  qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a  favorable
determination letter from the Internal Revenue  Service with respect to "TRA"
(as defined in Section 1 of Rev.  Proc. 93-39), and the Company is not aware
of any  circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such  favorable
determination letter. There is no material pending  or, to the knowledge of
the Company threatened, litigation  relating to the Plans, and there is no
existing condition,  situation or set of circumstances known to the Company
or any  of its Subsidiaries which could reasonably be expected to  result in
such litigation. Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has engaged
in a transaction with respect to any  Plan that, assuming the taxable period
of such transaction  expired as of the date hereof, could subject the Company
or  any Subsidiary to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section  4975 of
the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which  would be
material.   (3) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of  ERISA
has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or  any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen or  terminated "single-
employer plan", within the meaning of  Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA,
currently or formerly maintained  by any of them, or the   -29-  35  
single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one  employer with the
Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or  Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA
Affiliate"). Neither the  Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor an ERISA
Affiliate has  contributed to a Pension Plan that is a "multiemployer
plan",  within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, at any time on  or
after September 26, 1980 or could have liability in respect  of any such
plan. No notice of a "reportable event", within  the meaning of Section 4043
of ERISA for which the 30-day  reporting requirement has not been waived, has
been required  to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate 
within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof or will  be required to
be filed in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement.   (4) All contributions required to be made under the  terms of
any Compensation Plan have been timely made or have  been reflected on the
Financial Statements. Neither any  Pension Plan nor any single-employer plan
of an ERISA  Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or 
not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or  Section 302 of
ERISA and no ERISA Affiliate has an outstanding  funding waiver. Neither the
Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide,
security  to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer plan of an ERISA 
Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.   (5) Under each
Pension Plan which is a  single-employer plan, as of the last day of the most
recent  plan year ended prior to the date hereof, the actuarially 
determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within  the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on  the basis of the actuarial
assumptions contained in the Plan\'s  most recent actuarial valuation), did
not exceed the then  current value of the assets of such Plan, and there has
been  no adverse change in the financial condition of such Plan  since the
last day of the most recent plan year.   (6) Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries  has any obligations for retiree health, life or other
benefits  under any Compensation Plan.   (7) The consummation of the
transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, either alone or in conjunction
with any  other event, will not (x) entitle any Employees to severance  pay,
(y) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger  any payment or
funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise)  of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable  or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any of  the Compensation Plans or (z) result in any payments
under,  any of the Compensation Plans which would constitute a  "parachute
payment" to any "disqualified individual" as those  terms are defined in
Section 280G of the Code; provided, that  the representations of this
paragraph (7) shall not apply with  respect to any awards, payments,
compensation and benefits to  be paid or made pursuant to this Agreement or
other agreements  related to the transactions to be effected hereby.  
-30-  36   (8) All Compensation Plans covering current or former  non-U.S.
employees or otherwise maintained outside the U.S.  for U.S. employees are in
substantial compliance with  applicable local law ("Foreign Plans"). The
Company and its  Subsidiaries have no unfunded liabilities with respect to
any  Foreign Plan that are not properly reflected on the Financial 
Statements;   (9) There has been no amendment to, written  interpretation,
communication or announcement by the Company  or any of its affiliates
relating to, or change in employee  participation or coverage under, any
Compensation Plan, which  would significantly increase the expense of
maintaining such  Compensation Plan above the level of the expense incurred
in  respect thereof for the most recent fiscal year; and   (p) Labor
Relations. Each of the Company and its  Subsidiaries is in compliance with
all currently applicable laws  respecting employment and employment
practices, terms and conditions of  employment and wages and hours,
including, without limitation, the  Immigration Reform and Control Act, the
Worker Adjustment and  Retraining Notification Act, any such laws respecting
employment  discrimination, disability rights or benefits, equal opportunity,
plant  closure issues, affirmative action, workers\' compensation, employee 
benefits, severance payments, labor relations, employee leave issues,  wage
and hour standards, occupational safety and health requirements  and
unemployment insurance and related matters. None of the Company or  its
Subsidiaries is engaged in any unfair labor practice (within the  meaning of
the National Labor Relations Act). As of the date hereof,  there is no unfair
labor practice complaint pending or, to the  knowledge of the Company,
threatened against any of the Company or its  Subsidiaries before the
National Labor Relations Board. Neither the  Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or is bound by, any  collective bargaining
agreement, contract or other agreement or  understanding with a labor union
or labor organization, nor is the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries the
subject of a proceeding as of  the date hereof asserting that the Company or
any such Subsidiary has  committed an unfair labor practice (within the
meaning of the National  Labor Relations Act) or seeking to compel it or such
Subsidiary to  bargain with any labor organization as to wages and conditions
of  employment, nor is there any strike or other labor dispute involving 
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, pending or, to the best of the 
Company\'s knowledge, threatened, nor is it aware of any activity  involving
the Company\'s or any of its Subsidiaries\' employees seeking  to certify a
collective bargaining unit or engaging in any other  organization
activity.   (q) Insurance. The Company and its Subsidiaries are  insured
with reputable insurers against such risks and in such amounts  as is in
accordance with industry practices. Copies of all insurance  policies and
related documents have been made available to Acquiror.   (r) Accounting
Controls. Each Subsidiary of the Company  that is registered as a broker-
dealer has adopted recordkeeping systems  that comply with the requirements
of Section 17 of the Exchange Act and  the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and   -31-  37   the rules of all Self-Regulatory
Organizations having jurisdiction, and  maintains its records in accordance
therewith. Each of the Company and  its Subsidiaries has devised and
maintained systems of internal  accounting controls sufficient to provide
reasonable assurances that  (1) all transactions are executed in accordance
with management\'s  general or specific authorization; (2) all transactions

its Subsidiaries are eligible to participate to take into account for
purposes of eligibility and vesting thereunder the service of such employees
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as if such service were with
Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent that such past
service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or is provided generally to employees of Acquiror (and similar
treatment shall apply to past employee compensation). Within twenty days of
the date hereof, the Company shall furnish a list to Acquiror of all

against any Losses incurred in connection with any third party claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
permitted under the New York Limited Liability Company Law to indemnify such
person but only if such Member acted in good faith, for a purpose which such
Member reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Company, SLK
Management Inc. or the Partnership, as applicable, and, in criminal actions
or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct
was unlawful; provided, further, that Acquiror shall have the right to assume
and control the defense of such claim and any litigation resulting therefrom)
it being understood that such Member shall have the right to participate in
such defense and that Acquiror shall not consent to entry of any judgment or
entry into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Member of a release
from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.    ARTICLE

Elections. Until the Effective Time, except as Previously Disclosed or as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any Supplemental Agreement, the
Company will not, and the Company will cause any of its Subsidiaries and the
Partnership not to, make any Tax elections, amend any Tax elections currently
in effect, change or consent to any change in any method of accounting for
any Tax purpose or file any Tax Return (including any amended return) on  
-43-  49  a basis that is not consistent with past practice, in each case
without the prior written consent of the Acquiror, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, provided, however, that such consent shall not be
considered unreasonably withheld if the election, amendment or change, as the
case may be, would adversely affect the Acquiror.   (b) Tax Returns. Any
Tax Returns with respect to the operations of the Company, the Partnership
and their Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or before the Closing Date
(the "Pre-Closing Period"), including for those jurisdictions and tax
authorities that permit or require a short period Tax Return, shall be or
caused to be prepared and filed on a timely basis after the Closing by the
Acquiror. Whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of
the Company, the Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries for a portion of a
taxable year or period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date,
the determination of the Taxes of the Company, the Partnership or any of
their Subsidiaries for the portion of the taxable year or period ending on,
and the portion of the year or period beginning after, the Closing Date shall
be determined and shall equal: (i) in the case of any real or personal
property Tax or any other Tax imposed on a periodic basis, an amount equal to
the Tax for the entire taxable period beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in such portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in such entire taxable period;
and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, the amount that would be payable by
the Company, the Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries if its taxable year
that began prior to the Closing Date ended on the Closing Date. Any Taxes due
in respect of Tax Returns filed pursuant to the first sentence of this
paragraph and any Taxes allocable to Pre-Closing Periods under the
immediately preceding sentence (including any interest or penalties assessed
with respect to such Taxes) shall be considered "Pre-Closing Taxes". At least
10 business days prior to the filing of any such Tax Return that includes
Pre-Closing Taxes, Acquiror shall make available to the SLK Representative
copies of such proposed Tax Return, and the filing of such Tax Return shall
be subject to the approval of the SLK Representative, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld; provided, that, in the event the SLK
Representative does not provide such approval or disapproval to Acquiror
within 5 business days after receipt of such proposed Tax Return copies, the
SLK Representative shall be deemed to have provided an irrevocable approval
with respect to such Tax Return.   (c) Cooperation. The currently designated
Tax Matters Partner (as defined in Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code) of the
Company, the Partnership and each of their Subsidiaries that is treated as a
partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, shall continue as Tax
Matters Partner. If such Tax Matters Partner shall desire to resign such
position (or is to be liquidated or otherwise becomes ineligible) or the
Acquiror shall request the Tax Matters Partner\'s resignation, the current
Tax Matters Partner shall, subject to the Acquiror\'s consent which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, designate his or her replacement (and in the case
of a liquidation of the Tax Matters Partner, such designation shall occur
prior to liquidation) (and complete and execute any forms as may be required
to evidence or effect such designation) . The Acquiror and the Surviving LLC
shall cooperate with the Tax Matters Partner in any Tax audit, examination or
other proceeding involving the Company, the Partnership or any of their
Subsidiaries that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes for any taxable period that relates to periods prior to the  
-44-  50  Closing. The Tax Matters Partner shall not enter into any
compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax audit,
examination or other proceeding which would adversely affect the Acquiror for
any taxable year without the written consent of the Acquiror, which consent
may not be unreasonably withheld.   (d) Section 754 Election. To the extent
permitted by law and contract, the Company, the Partnership and each of their
respective Subsidiaries that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, shall make an election, or continue in effect any
election previously made, under Section 754 of the Code and any comparable
provision of any other tax law for the taxable year in which the Closing
occurs, provided, that the Company and the Partnership shall be required to
exercise any right (or, to the extent the Company or the Partnership can do
so, the Company and the Partnership shall cause any of their Subsidiaries to
exercise any right) they have to amend any contract to permit such election
to be made.   (e) Transfer Taxes. Fifty percent (50%) of all
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value added and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger (including any
real property transfer tax and any similar Tax) shall be paid by each of
Acquiror on the one hand, and the Members, on the other. Each party will, at
its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Taxes and fees, and to the extent required by applicable
law, each party will join, and cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates to join,
in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.   (f)
Allocation of Purchase Price. Acquiror shall determine the allocation of any
adjustments to the basis of the assets of the Company, the Partnership and
each of their respective Subsidiaries resulting from the Merger; provided,
that any such allocation to assets covered under Section 751 of the Code, if
any, shall be subject to approval of the Company, or, if after the Effective
Time, the SLK Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.   7.03 Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. Any Tax allocation
or sharing agreement or arrangement, whether or not written, that may have
been entered into by any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries or any member of
its affiliated groups (as defined in Section 1504(a) of the Code) shall
be terminated as of the Closing Date unless a continuation of such agreement
is required by law or contract, or consented to by the Acquiror. After the
Closing Date, none of the Surviving LLC or any of its Subsidiaries shall have
any further rights or liabilities thereunder.   7.04 Seller Tax
Indemnification.   (a) Each Acquiror Party shall, pursuant to this
Section 7.04(a) and the Supplemental Agreements, be entitled to
indemnification from the Members, severally and not jointly (in proportion to
their respective Consideration Percentages), against, and shall be held
harmless (subject to the limitations set forth herein) by the Members,
severally and not jointly (in proportion to their respective Consideration
Percentages), from:   -45-  51   (i) Pre-Closing Taxes in excess of Taxes
for which  reserves have been established prior to the date hereof or  will
be established prior to the Closing Date, consistent with  past practice;  
(ii) Pre-Closing Taxes imposed on any Acquiror Party as  members of an
"affiliated group" (within the meaning of  Section 1504(a) of the Code or any
comparable provision of  foreign, state or local law) that arises under
Treasury  Regulations Section 1.1502-6(a) or any comparable provision of 
foreign, state or local law; and   (iii) a breach of the representations set
forth in Section  7.01;  provided, however, that the Members shall not be
liable for and shall not indemnify any Acquiror Party for any Taxes resulting
from transactions or actions taken on the Closing Date (but after the
Closing) or after the Closing Date; provided, further, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, no Acquiror Party shall be entitled to payment of
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.04 (a) with respect to any
individual Loss unless the aggregate of all such Losses (after reduction for
any tax benefits realized as a result of the payment or accrual of such
Losses) shall exceed $5 million (and then only for the amount of such
excess).   (b) The amount of any indemnification payment payable
in accordance with this Section 7.04 and Article IX shall be reduced by the
amount of any reduction in Taxes actually realized (or to be realized in such
year) as a result of the event giving rise to the indemnification payment.
The Indemnified Party shall pay the Indemnifying Party the amount of any
reduction in Taxes actually realized in a future year as a result of the
event giving rise to such indemnification payment within ten (10) business
days of receiving such payment with respect to such reduction to the extent
such payment with respect to such reduction is received after the Indemnified
Party receives such indemnification payment, provided, that, the amount paid
shall not exceed the payments previously made by such Members under this
Section 7.04 or Article IX, as the case may be. Each Member shall be
severally and not jointly liable for such indemnification obligations in
proportion to their respective Consideration Percentages. Unless settled in a
reasonable period of time in cash by a Member or by delivery of Acquiror
Common Stock (valued at market price at the time of delivery), all amounts
payable for indemnification of Acquiror by any Member pursuant to this
Section 7.04 may, in Acquiror\'s sole discretion, be offset against shares of
Acquiror Common Stock owned by such Member or against other amounts payable
by Acquiror or any Affiliates of Acquiror to such Member. It is understood
that an Member\'s Acquiror Common Stock may be used to satisfy
amounts payable for indemnification even if such shares are not then
transferable under the transfer restrictions in the Member\'s Member
Agreement.   (c) Contests.   (i) The Acquiror shall notify the SLK
Representative if  the Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority)
shall  propose an adjustment, which, if upheld, would result in the  Members
making a payment under Section 7.04(a). If the SLK   -46-  52  
Representative shall request, the Acquiror shall (x) consult  with the SLK
Representative regarding the contest of such  proposed adjustment, (y) use
good faith efforts to permit the  SLK Representative to attend scheduled
meetings with the  Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority)
regarding  such contest and (z) if feasible, provide the SLK  Representative
with copies of written materials prior to  submission. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Acquiror shall  have absolute and complete control of any
contest provided,  that the Acquiror shall not settle any contest without
the  consent of the SLK Representative, which consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld.   (ii) The SLK Representative shall control any
contest  involving proposed adjustments to Tax returns filed by the 
Company, the Partnership or any of their respective  Subsidiaries for which
the liability for additional Taxes, if  the adjustments were to be upheld,
would be borne directly by  the Members. The SLK Representative shall consult
in good  faith with the Acquiror during the course of such contest, 
provided, that without the consent of the Acquiror, which  consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, the SLK  Representative shall not consent to any
adjustment that would  adversely affect Acquiror after the Closing.   (iii)
To the extent consistent with the foregoing, the  Company and the SLK
Representative shall cooperate with each  other in pursuing any contest under
this section.   7.05 Exclusivity. The indemnification and other
provisions of this Article VII shall be the sole provisions governing tax
indemnification matters.   7.06 Survival of Obligations. The obligations of
the parties set forth in this Article VII shall remain in effect until 60
days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.   7.07
Agreed Tax Treatment. Any Payment made to an Acquiror Party pursuant to
Section 7.04 and any Payment pursuant to Article IX shall constitute an
adjustment of the Merger Consideration for tax purposes, and shall be treated
as such by the Acquiror Parties, the Company and any Member on
their respective Tax Returns to the extent permitted by law. The parties
intend that the Merger Consideration shall, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, be treated as a payment for the Members\' Company Membership
Interest.    ARTICLE VIII   CONDITIONS TO CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER  
8.01 Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligation to Effect the Merger. The

Time, the Members shall, pursuant to this Section 9.01(c), be entitled to
indemnification from Acquiror against, and shall be held harmless (subject to
the limitations set forth herein) by Acquiror from, any and all Losses

with, any breaches of, (i) Acquiror\'s representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement (determined without regard to Section 5.02); or (ii)
the failure by Acquiror to perform in any material respect any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; provided, that notice of
any claim under this Section 9.01(c)(i) shall have been received by Acquiror
on or prior to the date until which the relevant representation or warranty
shall survive pursuant to Section 9.03; and provided, further, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, no Member shall be entitled to payment of
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9.01(c)(i) with respect to any
individual item of Loss, (A) unless, with respect to this Section 9.01(c)(i),
such item exceeds $1,000,000 (after reduction for any tax benefits realized

such Losses of all such parties with respect to this Section 9.01(c)(i) shall
exceed $10 million (after reduction for any tax benefits realized by
any Member as a result of such Loss and then only for the amount of such
excess); and provided, further, that notwithstanding the foregoing, no Member
will be entitled to payment of indemnification pursuant to this Section
9.01(c)(i) to the extent that the amount of all Losses for which Acquiror has
previously provided indemnification under Section 9.01(c)(i) exceeds $300
million in the aggregate.   (d) For the purposes of this Section 9.01, in
computing such individual or aggregate amounts of claims, the amount of each
claim shall be deemed to be an amount net of any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recoverable by the
indemnified party from any third party with respect thereto.   9.02 Notice
and Defense of Claims.   (a) Each party entitled to indemnification under
this Article IX (the "Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party or
parties required to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party")
promptly, but not later than 45 days, after such Indemnified Party receives
written notice of any claim, event or matter as to which indemnity may be
sought; provided, that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give notice as
provided in this Section 9.02 shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its
obligations under Section 9.01 or Section 7.04, except to the extent that
such failure actually and materially prejudices the rights of any such
Indemnifying Party and then only to the extent of such prejudice. In the
event of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand asserted by any person
who is not a party (or a successor to a party) to this Agreement (a "Third-
Party Claim") which is or gives rise to an indemnification claim, the
Indemnifying Party   -52-  58  may elect to assume and control the
defense of any such claim and any litigation resulting therefrom, provided,
that counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of
such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, shall be approved by the
Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld or
delayed), and the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at the
Indemnified Party\'s expense, which shall include counsel of its choice,
provided, further, that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ,
at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense, one counsel of its choice in each
applicable jurisdiction (if more than one jurisdiction is involved)
to represent the Indemnified Party if, in the Indemnified Party\'s
reasonable judgment, there exists an actual or potential conflict of interest
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party or if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to defend, compromise or settle a Third-Party
Claim, provided, further, that if the Indemnifying Party elects to assume and
control the defense but fails to retain counsel to prosecute the action
within thirty days of such election, then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to defend such Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the account
and risk of the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party, in the defense of
any such claim or litigation, shall not, except with the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any judgment or entry
into any settlement (i) which does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation or (ii)
which could reasonably be expected to restrict materially the conduct of
business of Acquiror or any of its Subsidiaries. In the event
the Indemnifying Party is prepared to settle an action and the Indemnified
Party reasonably believes that such settlement could have such an impact on
it then the Indemnified Party may choose to continue to defend such action in
which case the Indemnified Party shall be responsible for the incremental
costs of continuing such matter (including, the additional legal costs and
additional costs or losses with respect to such matter) in excess of the
amount offered to be settled by the Indemnifying Party (and the legal costs
incurred to date) which costs shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Indemnified Party shall make its employees
available and furnish such information regarding itself or the claim in
question as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in writing and as
shall be reasonably required in connection with the defense of such claim and
litigation resulting therefrom.   9.03 Survival of Representations and
Warranties. The representations and warranties shall survive the Closing,
until February 28, 2002 and, thereafter, to the extent a claim is made prior
to such date with respect to any breach of any such representation or
warranty until such claim is finally determined or settled, provided, that
the representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.03(o) and Article
VII shall survive the Closing until the expiration of all applicable statutes
of limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
last sentence of the representation and warranty set forth in Section
5.03(g)(i) and the indemnity obligation contained in Section 9.01(b) shall
survive forever.   -53-  59   ARTICLE X   TERMINATION   10.01
Termination. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger may be
abandoned:   (a) Consent. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by  the
mutual consent of each of Acquiror and the Company.   (b) Breach. At any
time prior to the Effective Time, by  Acquiror on the one hand, or the
Company, on the other hand, in the  event of either: (1) a breach by the
other of any representation or  warranty contained herein, which breach
cannot be or has not been cured  within 30 days after the giving of written
notice to the breaching  party of such breach; or (2) a breach by the other
of any of the  covenants or agreements contained herein, which breach cannot
be or has  not been cured within 10 days after the giving of written notice
to the  breaching party of such breach and which breach in the case of
either  of (1) and (2) above, would cause any condition set forth in
Article  VIII not to be satisfied.   (c) Delay. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, by  Acquiror, on the one hand, or the Company on the other
hand, in the  event that the Effective Time shall have failed to occur on or
before  May 31, 2001 except to the extent that such failure arises out of
or  results from any breach of this Agreement by or knowing action or 
inaction of the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this Section 
10.01(c).   (d) No Approval. By Acquiror, on the one hand, or the  Company,
on the other hand, if the approval of any Governmental  Authority required
for consummation of the Merger and the other  transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall have been denied by  final nonappealable action of such
Governmental Authority, or such  Governmental Authority shall have requested
the permanent withdrawal of  any application therefor, or any such approval
shall be made subject to  any condition or restriction described in the
proviso to Section  8.01(b).   (e) Order. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, by  Acquiror, on the one hand, or the Company on the other
hand, if any  Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting  consummation of the Merger shall become final and non-appealable
or any  Law is in effect or is adopted or issued, which has the effect of 
prohibiting the Merger.   10.02 Effect of Termination and Abandonment. In
the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger
pursuant to this Article X, no party to this Agreement shall have any
liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except (a) as
set forth in Section 11.03 and (b) that termination will not relieve a
breaching party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement.

manner set forth in Section 3.04 of the Merger Agreement. To the
extent necessary and as permitted by applicable law, Member hereby also
irrevocably (i) waives any notice, or requirement thereof, with respect to
any meeting of Members or other proceeding for the purpose of adopting and
approving the Merger Agreement, the Merger or any related matters and (ii)
acknowledges that Member will not have any dissenters\' or similar rights in

termination of the Merger Agreement.   (b) The Company hereby acknowledges
receipt and delivery at its principal place of business of an executed copy
of this Agreement sufficient to comply with Section 407(b) of the New York

all Supplemental Agreements, if any, to which it is to be a party as provided
in the Merger Agreement.   (b) Each Member who will be considered an
"acquiring person" under the rules and regulations promulgated under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act") in

transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as soon as practicable
after the date hereof.   (c) From and after the date hereof and until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Member shall not Transfer (as hereinafter
defined), directly or indirectly, all or any portion of its Membership
Interest without Acquiror\'s prior written consent; provided, however, that
in the event of such Member\'s death during the term of this Agreement,
Member\'s Membership Interest may be transferred in accordance with the
Operating Agreement.   (d) Member hereby agrees that from and after the date
hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Member will not, in any manner,
directly or indirectly (including through advisors, agents or other
intermediaries), take any action to seek, encourage, support or discuss any
offer from    -2-  66  any corporation, partnership, person or other
entity or group (other than Acquiror) to acquire any direct or indirect
Company Membership Interests, Partnership Interests or equity securities of
any Subsidiary of the Company (other than the issuance by the Partnership of
Class C Limited Partnership Interests and the issuance by First Options of
Chicago Inc. of shares of Class A Preferred Stock in connection with joint
back office arrangements in the ordinary course of business and consistent

the Company with any such person, or to otherwise acquire any significant

(e) Member hereby agrees to execute and deliver to Acquiror at the Closing, a
counterpart of the Acquiror Shareholders Agreement, which agreement shall be
in full force and effect.   (f) At any time after the date hereof, Member
shall promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or
documents reasonably requested by Acquiror and necessary for Member to

SLK, cause SLK to convey to Acquiror or its designee any and all of SLK\'s
current right, title and interest, whether direct or indirect, in the Class A
Limited Partnership Interest of the Partnership for an amount that shall be
determined by the Company, provided, that in no event shall Acquiror pay more
than $25 million in the aggregate for 100% of all of the Class A Partnership
Interest of the Partnership. After the date hereof, Member shall not Transfer
its interest in SLK and, except as otherwise provided by the preceding
sentence, Member shall, acting together with all other Members holding such
an interest in SLK, take all actions necessary to cause SLK not to transfer,
sell or otherwise reduce its right, title or interest in the Class A Limited
Partnership Interest of the Partnership.   3. Representations, Warranties
and Agreements. Member represents and warrants to, and agrees with, Acquiror
as follows:   (a) Member has all requisite power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to perform all of the obligations imposed upon
Member hereunder. Member is the lawful record and beneficial owner of
Member\'s Membership Interest set forth next to Member\'s name in Exhibit A
hereto, free and clear of all Liens other than Liens created by the
Constitutive Documents; no other person (other than any wholly-owned
affiliate controlled by Member) has an interest, legal, beneficial or
otherwise, in Member\'s Membership Interest and no consent of any other
person is required for the execution and delivery by Member of, and
performance by Member of its obligations under, this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, no person has any rights with
respect to Member\'s Membership Interest or the cash or Shares to be issued
to Member pursuant to the Merger Agreement under any community property or
similar legal provision    -3-  67   or concept. The representations
and warranties contained in the second and third sentences of this Section
3(a) shall not apply to any Membership Interest to the extent that such
representations and warranties would be deemed breached by virtue of any
existing pledge of such Membership Interest or by an existing contractual
restriction or because spousal consent is required as of the date hereof (so
long as such representations and warranties shall be true and correct, and
any required spousal consent under any community property law shall have been
obtained, at the Closing); provided, however, that this sentence shall not
affect any representation and warranty relating to the right, power
or authority of Member to vote or give a proxy or consent with respect to
Member\'s Membership Interest. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending or, to Member\'s knowledge, threatened against or affecting Member or
the assets of Member in any court or before or by any federal, state,
municipal or other governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency
or instrumentality which is reasonably likely to materially impair, restrict
or delay the ability of Member to perform Member\'s obligations under this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement or would make this paragraph untrue in any
material respect. This Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding
agreement of Member, enforceable in accordance with its terms except as the
enforceability hereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating to the
enforcement of creditors\' rights generally and by general principles of
equity.   (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
do not and will not (1) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default
under, or cause or allow the acceleration or creation of a Lien (with or
without the giving of notice, passage of time or both) pursuant to any law,
rule or regulation or any judgment, decree, order, governmental or non-
governmental permit or license, or any Contract to which Member is a party or
to which Member or any of Member\'s assets are subject or bound or (2)
require any consent or approval of any other person under any such law, rule,
regulation, judgment, decree, order, governmental or non-governmental permit,
license or Contract, in each case, which would materially impair, restrict or
delay the ability of Member to perform Member\'s obligations under this
Agreement.   (c) Member will acquire the Shares for Member\'s own account
and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution
thereof and Member has no present intention of selling, Transferring,
granting any participation in, or otherwise distributing the Shares except in
conformity with the Securities Act and other applicable federal and state
securities laws (the "Securities Laws").   (d) Member has read and fully
understands this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and the terms of the
proposed Merger. The SEC Documents related to Acquiror have been made
available to Member, and Member understands and has evaluated the risks of an
investment in the Shares. Member has been given the opportunity to ask
questions of, and receive answers from, Acquiror and its representatives
concerning the matters pertaining to Member\'s investment in the Shares and
has been given the opportunity to review such    -4-  68  additional
information as was necessary to evaluate the merits and risks of
an investment in the Shares. Member can bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Shares.   (e) Member is an "accredited investor" as
defined in Regulation D, which has been adopted by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act.   (f) Member
understands that all the Shares will be characterized as "restricted
securities" under the Securities Laws inasmuch as they are being acquired
from Acquiror in a transaction not involving a public offering and that,
consequently, the Shares may not be resold without first being
registered under the Securities Laws except in certain limited circumstances.
Specifically, Member is familiar with SEC Rules 144 and 145 and understands,
and agrees to comply with, the resale limitations imposed thereby, by the
legends described in paragraph (g) below and by the Securities Laws generally
or cause any other person who has an interest in such Shares to so
comply.   (g) Member understands and agrees that the certificates issued
to Member representing the Shares will bear the following legends and such
other legends as Acquiror may reasonably deem necessary or desirable:  
"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO A  MEMBER\'S
AGREEMENT WITH THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. (THE  "MEMBER\'S AGREEMENT"),
AND A SHAREHOLDERS\' AGREEMENT AMONG THE  GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND THE
PERSONS NAMED THEREIN, COPIES  OF WHICH ARE ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL
EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE  GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., AND WHICH, AMONG OTHER
MATTERS, PLACE  RESTRICTIONS ON THE VOTING AND DISPOSITION OF SUCH
SECURITIES.  THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE
INDIRECTLY  OR DIRECTLY SOLD, TRANSFERRED, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED
OF,  INCLUDING ANY DISPOSITION OF THE ECONOMIC OR OTHER RISKS OF  OWNERSHIP
THROUGH HEDGING TRANSACTIONS OR DERIVATIVES INVOLVING  SUCH SECURITIES, ONLY
IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE  MEMBER\'S AGREEMENT."   "THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN  REGISTERED UNDER
THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE  "SECURITIES ACT"), OR OTHER
SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE  OFFERED, SOLD, EXCHANGED, TRANSFERRED,
ASSIGNED, PLEDGED,  PARTICIPATED, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF (EACH
A  "TRANSFER") EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION    -5-  69   FROM
REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND, IF APPLICABLE,  SUCH OTHER
SECURITIES LAWS AND FOLLOWING RECEIPT BY THE GOLDMAN  SACHS GROUP, INC. OF A
LEGAL OPINION IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE  SATISFACTORY TO IT THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS
PERMITTED."  The foregoing legends will be removed from a Share certificate
at the request of Member or another holder thereof in connection with the
proposed transfer thereof only upon satisfaction of Acquiror that such legend
is no longer required or appropriate, including, in the case of the
Securities Laws legend, receipt by Acquiror of an opinion of counsel, in form
and substance satisfactory to Acquiror, to the effect that registration under
the Securities Act is unnecessary in respect of such proposed transfer, in
reliance upon SEC Rule 144 or 145 under the Securities Act, and that such
legend is not required by law to appear on such certificate.   Member
agrees and consents to the entry of stop transfer orders against the transfer
of Shares subject to transfer restrictions.   (h) Member meets any
suitability standards imposed by the state of Member\'s residence or imposed
by any other applicable laws.   (i) From and after the date hereof and until
the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms, Member agrees to comply as soon as reasonably
practicable with the restrictions on hedging contained in Exhibit D hereto;
it being understood that Member shall in no event on or after the date hereof
commence any activities that involve the disposition of the economic or other
risks of ownership through hedging transactions or derivatives involving
Acquiror securities or Member\'s Membership Interest.   (j) Member has not,
and through the Closing Date will not have, made any election, taken any
action or filed any Tax Return or any other document filed or provided to any
taxing authority that is inconsistent with the Tax Returns filed and
furnished by the Company and the Company\'s Subsidiaries or the treatment of
the Company as a partnership and of each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries as a
partnership or disregarded entity (except as set forth in Section 7.01(n) of
the Disclosure Schedule to the Merger Agreement) for U.S. federal, state and
local Tax purposes and Member agrees that the foregoing representations shall
be subject to the same indemnification provisions as contemplated by Section
13 herein.   (k) Member will not make any election, take any action or
take any position on any Tax Return or any other document filed or provided
to any Taxing Authority that is inconsistent with any Tax Return filed with
any taxing authority, or furnished to such Member, by or on behalf of the
Company, the Company\'s Subsidiaries or the Surviving LLC.    -6- 
70    (l) Member agrees to provide, and to use its reasonable best efforts
to cause its respective relatives and affiliates to provide, any document or
take any other action reasonably requested by Acquiror in connection with any
Tax matters relating to the Company, the Company\'s Subsidiaries and
the Surviving LLC so long as such action does not adversely affect the Member
(or any of its respective relatives or affiliates).   (m) Member has
received, separately considered and executed the Supplemental Members
Agreement attached as Exhibit E.   4. Restrictions on Transfer. (a) Member
agrees that the Shares may be Transferred only as follows:   (i) 33 1/3% of
the Shares may be Transferred at any time after  May 8, 2002;   (ii) An
additional 33 1/3% of the Shares may be Transferred at  any time after May 8,
2003; and   (iii) All of the Shares may be Transferred at any time after
May  8, 2004.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Acquiror generally waives
the restrictions on transfer imposed upon the former Schedule II limited
partners (the "LPs") of The Goldman Sachs Group, L.P. ("Group") in connection
with Group\'s 1999 Plan of Incorporation in order to permit the LPs generally
to engage in a registered secondary offering or estate planning transactions,
Acquiror will waive the transfer restrictions in this Section 4 with respect
to the Shares on (i) the same percentage basis as the waiver granted to LPs
in connection with such registered secondary offering and to permit Member to
sell such shares in the registered secondary offering and (ii) the same basis
as the waiver granted to LPs in connection with such estate planning
transactions. (For example, if each LP is permitted to sell 5% of his
Acquiror Common Stock in a registered secondary offering, Member shall be
permitted to sell 5% of Member\'s Shares; and if each LP is permitted to
engage in estate planning transactions, Member shall be permitted to do so to
a similar extent.)   For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Transfer"
means any direct or indirect sale, transfer, pledge or other disposition of
securities of Acquiror or Member\'s Membership Interests, as the case may be,
including any disposition of the economic or other risks of ownership through
hedging transactions or derivatives involving Acquiror securities or
Member\'s Membership Interests; provided, however, that in the event of such
Member\'s death during the term of this Agreement, Member\'s Shares may be
transferred in the same manner and to the same extent as the LPs may transfer
their shares of Acquiror Common Stock pursuant to the Acquiror Shareholders
Agreement.   (c) Member agrees that, at any time Member is employed by
the Firm, it will:    -7-  71   (i) comply with respect to all Shares
with Transfer  restrictions related to future primary or secondary 
offerings of Shares if requested to do so by Acquiror to  the extent that
such restrictions are generally applicable  to similarly titled employees of
Acquiror;   (ii) comply with restrictions that may be imposed by Acquiror 
from time to time to enable Acquiror or another party to  account for a
business combination using the  pooling-of-interests method of accounting to
the extent  that such restrictions are generally applicable to  similarly
titled employees of Acquiror;   (iii) be subject to the same internal
compliance and trading  policies as are in effect from time to time for
similarly  titled employees of Acquiror; and   (iv) comply with the hedging
restrictions of Acquiror relating  to securities of Acquiror and financial
services companies  as are in effect from time to time for managing
directors  of Acquiror.   References in this Section 4 to "Shares" shall be
deemed to also refer to securities received in exchange for Shares on the
same basis as provided in Section 6.4 of the Acquiror Shareholders
Agreement.   5. Confidential Information. (a) In the course of involvement
in the Firm\'s activities or otherwise, Member has obtained or may
obtain confidential information concerning the Firm\'s businesses,
strategies, operations, financial affairs, organizational and personnel
matters (including information regarding any aspect of Member\'s tenure as a
member in, or officer or employee of, the Firm or of the termination of such
membership, officership or employment), policies, procedures and other non-
public matters, or concerning those of third parties. Such information
("Confidential Information") may have been or be provided in written or
electronic form or orally. In consideration of, and as a condition to,
continued access to Confidential Information, and without prejudice to or
limitation on any other confidentiality obligations imposed by agreement or
by law, Member hereby undertakes to use and protect Confidential Information
in accordance with any reasonable restrictions placed on its use or
disclosure. Without limiting the foregoing, except as authorized by the Firm
or as required by law, Member may not disclose, directly or indirectly, any
Confidential Information, or any information derived therefrom, in whatever
form, to any person unless such person is a director, officer, partner,
employee, attorney or agent of the Firm and, in Member\'s reasonable good
faith judgment, has a need to know the Confidential Information
or information derived therefrom in furtherance of the business of the Firm.
The foregoing obligations will survive, and remain binding and
enforceable notwithstanding any termination of Member\'s employment with the
Firm and any settlement of the financial rights and obligations arising from
Member\'s employment with the Firm. Without limiting the foregoing, the
existence of, and any information concerning, any dispute    -8- 
72  between Member and the Firm shall constitute Confidential Information
except that Member may disclose information concerning such dispute to the
arbitrator or court that is considering such dispute, or to Member\'s legal
counsel (provided that such counsel agrees not to disclose any such
information other than as necessary to the prosecution or defense of the
dispute).   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Firm" means (i) prior to
the consummation of the Merger, the Company and its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates, and (ii) from and after the consummation of the Merger, Acquiror
and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates (including the Company and its
Subsidiaries).   6. Noncompetition. (a) In view of Member\'s importance to
the Firm, Member hereby agrees that the Firm would likely suffer significant
harm from Member\'s competing with the Firm for some period of time following
the consummation of the Merger, and at any time prior to the date of
termination specified in the notice of termination pursuant to Section 10
hereof (the "Employment Period") and for some time thereafter, and Member
understands that Acquiror would not have agreed to acquire the Company and
its business unless Member entered into this Agreement. Moreover, Member
recognizes and agrees that the business activities of the Firm are worldwide
and that the restrictions on competition included herein are commensurate in
geographic scope with those activities. Accordingly, Member hereby agrees
that commencing at the time of consummation of the Merger, Member will not,
without the written consent of Acquiror, until the later of (x) three years
following the Effective Time and (y) two years following the date of
termination of the Employment Period (such later date is referred to as the
"Expiration Date"):   (1) form, or acquire a 5% or greater equity ownership,
voting or  profit participation interest in, any Competitive Enterprise (as
defined  below); or   (2) associate (including, but not limited to,
association as an  officer, employee, partner, director, consultant, agent or
advisor) with  any Competitive Enterprise and in connection with such
association  engage in, or directly or indirectly manage or supervise
personnel  engaged in, any activity   (i) which is similar or substantially
related to any  activity in which Member was engaged, in whole or in part, at
the  Firm,   (ii) for which Member had direct or indirect managerial or 
supervisory responsibility at the Firm, or   (iii) which calls for the
application of the same or similar  specialized knowledge or skills as those
utilized by Member in  Member\'s activities with the Firm,    -9- 
73    at any time during the one-year period immediately prior to the 
Expiration Date (or, in the case of an action taken during the  Employment
Period, during the one-year period immediately prior to such  action), and,
in any such case, irrespective of the purpose of the  activity or whether the
activity is or was in furtherance of advisory,  agency, proprietary or
fiduciary business of either the Firm or the  Competitive Enterprise.   (By
way of example only, this provision precludes an information systems 
professional from joining a management or other consulting firm and 
providing information technology consulting services or advice to any 
Competitive Enterprise.)   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Competitive Enterprise" is a business enterprise that (1) engages in any
activity, or (2) owns or controls a significant interest in any entity that
engages in any activity, that, in either case, competes anywhere with any
activity in which the Firm is engaged. The activities covered by the previous
sentence include, without limitation, financial services such as investment
banking, public or private finance, lending, financial advisory services,
private investing (for anyone other than Member and members of Member\'s
family), merchant banking, asset or hedge fund management, insurance or
reinsurance underwriting or brokerage, property management, or securities,
futures, commodities, energy, derivatives or currency brokerage, sales,
market making, lending, custody, clearance, settlement or trading. It is the
intent that the provisions of this Section 6 shall include, for the entire
period through the Expiration Date, the activities described in subparagraphs
1 through 4 of Article 14.E of the Operating Agreement as in effect as of the
date hereof.   If Member is employed by the Firm immediately following
the Effective Time and the Firm terminates Member\'s employment with the Firm
without Cause, the Firm may only enforce the provisions of this Section 6 for
so long as the Firm continues to pay Member the same base salary (i.e.,
excluding any incentive, bonus or similar compensation) Member was receiving
immediately prior to such termination. In determining whether the Firm has
paid Member\'s base salary for any period, the Firm shall receive credit for
any payments under any severance, salary continuation or similar plan or
arrangement.   For the purposes of this Section 6 and Section 10 only,
"Cause" means (i) Member\'s conviction, whether following trial or by plea of
guilty or nolo contendere (or similar plea), in a criminal proceeding (A) on
a misdemeanor charge involving fraud, false statements or misleading
omissions, wrongful taking, embezzlement, bribery, forgery, counterfeiting or
extortion, or (B) on a felony charge or (C) on an equivalent charge to those
in clauses (A) and (B) in jurisdictions which do not use those designations;
(ii) Member\'s engaging in any conduct which constitutes an employment
disqualification under applicable law (including statutory disqualification
as defined under the Exchange Act); (iii) Member\'s willful or grossly
negligent failure to perform Member\'s duties to the Firm; (iv) Member\'s
violation of any securities or commodities laws, any rules or regulations
issued pursuant to such laws, or the rules and regulations of any securities
or commodities exchange or    -10-  74  association of which Acquiror or
any of its subsidiaries or affiliates is a member; (v) Member\'s violation of
any Firm policy concerning hedging or confidential or proprietary
information, or Member\'s material violation of any other Firm policy as in
effect from time to time; (vi) Member\'s engaging in any act or making any
statement which impairs, impugns, denigrates, disparages or negatively
reflects upon the name, reputation or business interests of the Firm; or
(vii) Member\'s engaging in any willful or grossly negligent
conduct detrimental to the Firm. The determination as to whether "Cause" has
occurred shall be made by the Board of Directors of Acquiror in its good
faith judgment.   7. Nonsolicitation of Clients. (a) Member hereby agrees
that during the Employment Period and thereafter until the Expiration Date,
Member will not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, (1) Solicit a Client
to transact business with a Competitive Enterprise or to reduce or refrain
from doing any business with the Firm, or (2) interfere with or damage (or
attempt to interfere with or damage) any relationship between the Firm and a
Client.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solicit" means
any direct or indirect communication of any kind whatsoever, regardless of by
whom initiated, inviting, advising, encouraging or requesting any person or
entity, in any manner, to take or refrain from taking any action. It is the
intent that the provisions of this Section 7 shall include, for the entire
period through the Expiration Date, the activities described in subparagraph
5 of Article 14.E of the Operating Agreement as in effect as of the date
hereof.   (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Client" means
any client or prospective client of the Firm to whom Member provided
services, or for whom Member transacted business, or whose identity became
known to Member in connection with Member\'s relationship with or employment
by the Firm.   8. Nonsolicitation of Employees; Expiration. Member hereby
agrees that during the Employment Period and thereafter until the Expiration
Date, Member will not, in any manner, directly or indirectly, Solicit any
person who is a Member or former Member of the Company or a key employee of
the Firm to resign from the Firm or to apply for or accept employment with
any Competitive Enterprise.   9. Damages. (a) Member acknowledges that
Acquiror would not have entered into this Agreement or the Merger Agreement
in the absence of the Member\'s agreement to the provisions of this Section 9
and the Covenants and Member further acknowledges that such compliance with
such Covenants is an important factor to the continued success of the Firm\'s
operations and its future prospects. Member and Acquiror agree that upon the
occurrence of any of the following events, the damages to the Firm would be
material, but that the amount of such damages would be uncertain and not
readily ascertainable. Accordingly, Member and Acquiror agree that, if, prior
to the fifth anniversary of the date of this Agreement, Member breaches any
of the Covenants set forth in Section 6, 7 or 8, as determined by the Board
of Directors of Acquiror (the "Board") in its    -11-  75  good faith
judgment, Acquiror will be entitled to receive immediately following such
determination and written demand therefor, and Member will make, within
ten business days after written demand has been received, a payment in cash
or Acquiror Common Stock (valued at the average closing per share price of
Acquiror Common Stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the
date of payment under this Section 9(a)) in such combination of cash and/or
Acquiror Common Stock as the Member shall determine as and for liquidated
damages (the "Liquidated Damages") in the amount set forth next to such
Member\'s name in Exhibit C (under the heading "Liquidated Damages") attached
hereto, which amount shall be the aggregate amount of liquidated damages due
for all such breaches prior to the fifth anniversary of this Agreement.  
The payment of any amount as liquidated damages will not be construed as a
release or waiver by Acquiror of the right to prevent the continuation of any
such violation of such Covenants in equity or otherwise. In addition, Member
and Acquiror agree that it would be too speculative to attempt to determine
any amount of liquidated damages that would be applicable following the fifth
anniversary of the date of this Agreement, and that any damages payable as a
result of any breach following such date shall be determined without regard
to this Section 9.   (b) Member and Acquiror agree that the Liquidated
Damages are reasonable in proportion to the probable damages likely to be
sustained by the Firm if Member breaches at any time prior to the fifth
anniversary of this Agreement any of the Covenants set forth in Sections 6, 7
and 8 hereof, that the amount of actual damages to be sustained by the Firm
in the event of such breach is incapable of precise estimation and that such
cash payments are not intended to constitute a penalty or punitive damages
for any purposes.   (c) Member acknowledges and agrees that Member\'s
payment obligations under this Section 9 will be full recourse obligations
and will be secured pursuant to a Pledge Agreement, in substantially the form
set forth as Exhibit F hereto (the "Pledge Agreement"). Member agrees to
execute and deliver to Acquiror a Pledge Agreement prior to the Closing.  
(d) Member acknowledges and agrees that any cash payment of Liquidated
Damages pursuant to this Section 9 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu
of, any forfeitures of awards (required pursuant to the terms of any such
awards) that may be granted to Member in the future under one or more of the
Firm\'s compensation and benefit plans.   10. Employment with the Firm. (a)
Member acknowledges that Acquiror would not have entered into this Agreement
or the Merger Agreement in the absence of Member\'s agreement to the
provisions of this Section 10, and Member further acknowledges that such
Member\'s continued employment with the Firm through the second anniversary
of the Effective Time is essential to assure the proper integration of the
business operations of the Company into the Firm and is an important factor
to the continued success of the Firm\'s operations and its future prospects.
Accordingly, Member hereby agrees to remain employed with the Firm for the
period commencing on the Effective Time through the second   -12- 
76   anniversary of the Effective Time (the "Initial Employment Period").
After the Initial Employment Period (unless otherwise agreed by Member and
the Firm in writing), there will be no set term of employment. The Firm may
terminate Member\'s employment at any time during or after the Initial
Employment Period for any reason, or for no reason, and Member may terminate
employment for any reason or no reason after the Initial Employment Period.
Such termination shall be effected only by giving not less than ninety (90)
days\' prior written notice of termination; provided, however, that (i) the
Firm may elect to place Member on paid leave for all or any part of such
90-day period; (ii) no advance notice need be given by the Firm to Member in
connection with a termination of Member\'s employment for Cause or on account
of Disability; and (iii) provided that the 90 days prior written notice is
given, Member may terminate his employment during the Initial Employment
Period on account of Good Reason, Disability or with Acquiror\'s written
consent. For purposes of this Section 10, "Good Reason" means, without the
consent of Member, a materially adverse alteration in Member\'s position or
in the nature or status of Member\'s responsibilities from those in effect
immediately after the Effective Time, or (ii) the Firm\'s requiring Member\'s
principal place of employment to be located more than seventy-five (75) miles
from the location at which Member is principally employed immediately after
the Effective Time (except for required travel on the Firm\'s business to an
extent substantially consistent with Member\'s customary business travel
obligations in the ordinary course of business prior to the Effective Time).
For purposes of this Section 10, "Disability" means Member\'s absence from
employment for at least 180 days in any 12-month period as a result of
Member\'s incapacity due to mental or physical illness or incapacity,
as reasonably determined by the Firm.   (b) At the outset of the Employment
Period, Member\'s duties and responsibilities will not be, without Member\'s
written consent, materially diminished from Member\'s duties and
responsibilities immediately prior to the Effective Time (it being understood
that any diminishment in duties or responsibilities as a result of the
Company and its Affiliates being Subsidiaries of Acquiror shall be
disregarded). During the Employment Period: (i) Member will have such duties
and responsibilities as the Firm may from time to time determine; (ii) Member
will devote his entire working time, labor, skill and energies to the
business and affairs of the Firm, provided, however, that Member shall not be
prohibited from making passive personal investments or conducting private
affairs if those activities do not interfere with the services required under
this Agreement; and (iii) Member will be paid such base salary and other
compensation as shall be separately communicated to him.   (c) It is
understood and agreed that the provisions of this Section 10 shall not apply
to: Pumpkin Trust; Michael Appleby; Patrick C. Boyle; Michael H. Davis;
Robert W. Luckow; Lowell J. Millar; William G. Peskoff; Norman R. Schlanger;
Alfred Thomas; and Frank Weinberg III (collectively, the
"Retiring Members").   11. Transfer of Client Relationships. (a) During the
Coverage Period, Member hereby agrees to take all actions and do all such
things as may be reasonably requested by the Firm from time to time to
maintain for the Firm the business, goodwill, and   -13-  77  business
relationships with any of the Firm\'s Clients with whom Member worked during
the term of Member\'s employment with the Firm.   (b) For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Coverage Period" means, the 90-day period beginning on
the date on which notice of Member\'s termination of employment is delivered
to or by the Firm pursuant to Section 10, or in the case of termination of
Member\'s employment by the Firm for Cause or on account of Extended Absence,
the 90-day period beginning on the date of termination.   12. Prior Notice
Required. Member hereby agrees that prior to accepting employment with any
other person or entity prior to the date of termination, Member will provide
such prospective employer with written notice of the provisions of this
Agreement, with a copy of such notice delivered simultaneously to the General
Counsel of Acquiror.   13. Indemnification. Member hereby agrees that it
shall indemnify each Acquiror Party as an Indemnifying Party as set forth in
Articles 7 and 9 of the Merger Agreement.   14. Taxes.   (a) Tax Returns.
Member hereby agrees to prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed)
when due (taking into account any applicable extensions) all of his, her or
its Tax Returns related to periods during which the Merger occurs, and Member
will timely pay all Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns (or which are due
with respect to such Tax Returns after adjustment by any taxing authority).
Member further agrees to cooperate with Acquiror and to provide Acquiror with
any documentation as reasonably requested in establishing the timely filing
of such Tax Returns and timely payment of such Taxes.   (b) Tax Treatment of
the Common Stock. Member agrees that the Acquiror Common Stock subject to the
restrictions on Transfer (as described in Section 4 herein) and received by
the Members in the Merger will be valued for all U.S. federal income tax
purposes at 100% of the mean of the high and low of the trading price of the
Acquiror Common Stock on the Effective Date.   (c) Cooperation. Member
agrees to cooperate with the Tax Matters Partner (as defined in Section
6231(a)(7) of the Code) (or its designee) to the extent reasonably requested
in any Tax audit, examination or other proceeding involving the Company, the
Partnership or any Subsidiary that is treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes for any taxable period that relates to periods
prior to the Closing. Member further agrees that the existing Tax Matters
Partner (or if the existing Tax Matters Partners does not so act, the
Acquiror (or its designee)) shall have the right to designate or appoint
any individual or entity in the name and on behalf of such Member, as the
Tax Matters Partner, with respect to any taxable year of the Company,
the Partnership or any of their Subsidiaries.   -14-  78   (d)
Overpayments and Underpayments. The parties hereby agree that in the event
the Company makes distributions to Member pursuant to the terms of 4.01(c)(i)
or (iv) of the Merger Agreement, the parties shall as promptly as practicable
after the Closing determine whether the actual amount of Taxes owed by Member
in respect of the net earnings of the Company during the period from July 1,
2000 to the Closing Date (after taking into account Tax credits and other
available Tax assets and not including any Taxes payable as the result
of sales or other dispositions requiring the recognition of unrealized
gains reflected on the June 30, 2000 Financial Statements (including the
"short against the box" positions)) is greater than (an "Underpayment") or
less than (an "Overpayment") the amounts distributed to such Member with
respect to the period from July 1, 2000 to the Closing Date in respect to
such Taxes, and, in the event of an Overpayment, Member shall promptly pay to
Acquiror and, in the event of an Underpayment, Acquiror shall promptly pay to
Member, the amount of such difference.   15. Intentionally Omitted.   16.
Covenants Generally. (a) Member\'s covenants as set forth in Sections 5
through 14 of this Agreement are from time to time referred to herein as the
"Covenants." If any of the Covenants is finally held to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable (whether in whole or in part), such Covenant shall be deemed
modified to the extent, but only to the extent, of such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability and the remaining such Covenants
(or part of such Covenants, as the case may be) shall not be affected
thereby; provided, however, that if any of such Covenants is finally held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable because it exceeds the maximum scope
determined to be acceptable to permit such provision to be enforceable, such
Covenant will be deemed to be modified to the minimum extent necessary to
modify such scope in order to make such provision enforceable hereunder.  
(b) Member understands that the provisions of the Covenants may limit
Member\'s ability to earn a livelihood in a business similar to the business
of the Firm.   (c) Member acknowledges that a violation on Member\'s part of
any of the Covenants would cause irreparable damage to the Firm. Accordingly,
Member agrees that the Firm will be entitled to injunctive relief for any
actual or threatened violation of any of the Covenants in addition to any
other remedies it may have.   (d) Acquiror will at all times maintain an
effective S-8 or other registration statement covering shares of Acquiror
Common Stock to be delivered pursuant to the restricted stock unit awards
specified in Section 3.05 of the Merger Agreement and in connection with the
administration of such awards shall treat the Member in the same manner as
similarly titled employees of Acquiror and its subsidiaries.   17. Waiver
and Release. (a) Member hereby irrevocably waives any right to contest the
terms of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby,  
-15-  79   whether on the grounds of unequal or disparate treatment,
inconsistency or conflict with the terms and provisions of the Operating
Agreement.   (b) Member hereby irrevocably releases Acquiror, each and
every affiliate, shareholder, subsidiary, partner, officer, member, director
and employee of Acquiror and its affiliates in their capacities as
such ("Releasees") from any claims, liabilities, costs, expenses, actions,
suits or demands however arising, whether at law or in equity, contingent,
known or unknown, which Member or his heirs, successors or assigns may have
or assert, in respect of any interest in the Company and its affiliates or
arising out of any Membership Interest, Partnership Interest, or Member,
partnership or employment relationship with the Company or its affiliates
which Member or Member\'s heirs, successors or assigns may have or have had;
provided that this release shall not extend to (i) agreements entered into
hereunder or in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and (ii) any conduct that resulted from a Releasee\'s bad faith,
fraud or criminal act or omission.   18. Arbitration. Subject to the
provisions of Sections 19 and 20 hereof, any dispute, controversy or claim
between Member and the Firm arising at or after the Effective Time out of or
relating to or concerning the provisions of this Agreement, relating to or
arising out of Member\'s employment with the Firm or otherwise concerning any
rights, obligations or other aspects of Member\'s employment relationship in
respect of the Firm ("Employment Related Matters"), shall be finally settled
by arbitration in New York City before, and in accordance with the rules then
obtaining of, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") or, if the NYSE
declines to arbitrate the matter, the American Arbitration Association (the
"AAA") in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the AAA.  
19. Injunctive Relief; Submission to Jurisdiction; Specific Performance. (a)
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 18, and in addition to its right to
submit any dispute or controversy to arbitration, the Firm may bring an
action or special proceeding in a state or federal court of
competent jurisdiction sitting in the City of New York, whether or not an
arbitration proceeding has theretofore been or is ever initiated, for the
purpose of temporarily, preliminarily, or permanently enforcing the
provisions of the Covenants, or to enforce an arbitration award, and, for the
purposes of this Section 19, Member (i) expressly consents to the application
of Section 20 to any such action or proceeding, (ii) agrees that proof will
not be required that monetary damages for breach of the provisions of the
Covenants would be difficult to calculate and that remedies at law would be
inadequate and (iii) irrevocably appoints the General Counsel of Acquiror as
Member\'s agent for service of process in connection with any such action or
proceeding, who shall promptly advise Member of any such service of
process.   (b) Each party hereto severally acknowledges that it will
be impossible to measure in money the damage to the other party if the party
hereto fails to comply with any of the obligations imposed by this Agreement
and that every such obligation is material. Accordingly, each party hereto
severally agrees that injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, in
addition to remedies at law or damages, is the appropriate remedy for any
such   -16-  80  failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief
on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at law.   20.
Choice of Forum. (a) MEMBER AND THE FIRM HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE
EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT LOCATED IN THE CITY OF
NEW YORK OVER ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO OR
CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY EMPLOYMENT RELATED MATTER THAT IS NOT
OTHERWISE ARBITRATED ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 18 HEREOF. This
includes any suit, action or proceeding to compel arbitration or to
enforce an arbitration award. This also includes any suit, action, or
proceeding arising out of or relating to any post-employment Employment
Related Matters. Member and the Firm acknowledge that the forum designated by
this Section 20 has a reasonable relation to this Agreement, and to Member\'s
relationship to the Firm. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall
preclude the Firm from bringing any action or proceeding in any other court
for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of Sections 18, 19 or 20.   (b)
The agreement of Member and the Firm as to forum is independent of the law
that may be applied in the action, and Member and the Firm agree to such
forum even if the forum may under applicable law choose to apply non-forum
law. Member and the Firm hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any objection which Member or the Firm now or hereafter may
have to personal jurisdiction or to the laying of venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any court referred to in Section 20(a). Member and
the Firm undertake not to commence any action arising out of or relating to
or concerning this Agreement in any forum other than a forum described in
this Section 20. Member and the Firm agree that, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, a final and non-appealable judgment in any such
suit, action or proceeding in any such court shall be conclusive and binding
upon Member and the Firm.   21. Choice of Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT OF LAWS.   22. No Right to
Employment. Nothing in this Agreement or the Merger Agreement shall confer
upon Member the right to employment or continued employment by the Firm or
affect the Firm\'s right to terminate such employment at will.   23.
Miscellaneous. (a) This Agreement and the Merger Agreement shall supersede
any other agreement, written or oral, pertaining to the matters covered
herein.   (b) Notices hereunder shall be delivered to Acquiror at
its principal executive office directed to the attention of its General
Counsel, and to Member at Member\'s last address appearing in the Firm\'s
employment records.   -17-  81   (c) This Agreement may not be amended or
modified, other than by a written agreement executed by Member and Acquiror
or its successors, nor may any provision hereof be waived other than by a
writing executed by Member or Acquiror or its successors; provided, that any
waiver, consent, amendment or modification of any of the provisions of this
Agreement will not be effective against the Firm without the written consent
of Acquiror or its successors. Member may not, directly or indirectly
(including by operation of law), assign Member\'s rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of Acquiror or its successors,
and any such assignment by Member in violation of this Agreement shall be
void. This Agreement shall be binding upon Member\'s permitted successors and
assigns. Without impairing Member\'s obligations hereunder, Acquiror may at
any time and from time to time assign its rights and obligations hereunder to
any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (and have such rights and obligations
reassigned to it or to any other subsidiary or affiliate). This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Firm and its
assigns.   (d) Without limiting the provisions of Section 16(a) hereof,
