iii  5    STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of April 28, 2000, between
Resco Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("RESCO"), Waste Management
Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("WMHI"), Waste Management, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("WMI") and Synagro Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "PURCHASER"), relating to the purchase and sale of all of
the shares of outstanding capital stock of Wheelabrator Water Technologies,
Inc., a Maryland corporation ("WWTI") and of Residuals Processing, Inc., a
California corporation ("RPI"). Each of Resco and WMHI may also be referred
to herein individually as a "SELLER," and Resco and WMHI may be referred to
herein together as the "SELLERS". Each of WWTI and RPI may also be referred
to herein individually as a "COMPANY," and WWTI and RPI may be referred to
herein together as the "COMPANIES."   WHEREAS, Resco owns all of the
outstanding capital stock (the "WWTI SHARES") of WWTI, and WMHI owns all of
the outstanding capital stock (the "RPI SHARES," and together with the WWTI
Shares, the "COMPANY SHARES") of RPI.   WHEREAS, WMI directly or indirectly
owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Resco and WMHI.   WHEREAS,
Resco wishes to sell the WWTI Shares to the Purchaser, WMHI wishes to sell
the RPI Shares to the Purchaser and the Purchaser wishes to purchase the WWTI
Shares and the RPI Shares.   WHEREAS, WMI desires to guarantee the
performance of the obligations of the Sellers hereunder and WMI desires to be
subject to certain agreements herein to induce the Purchaser to purchase the
Company Shares from the Sellers.   NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree
as follows:   1. Sale and Purchase.   1.1 Sale and Purchase of the Company
Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing
(as defined in Section 1.2), (i) Resco shall sell, and the Purchaser shall
purchase, the WWTI Shares, and (ii) WMHI shall sell, and the Purchaser shall
purchase, the RPI Shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $146,100,000
plus the Marshall Case Costs (the "INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE"), in each case
payable as set forth below in Section 1.2 and subject to adjustment as
provided in Section 1.2(b) and Section 1.3.   1.2 Closing. The closing of
the sale and purchase of the Company Shares (the "CLOSING") will take place
at the offices of Debevoise and Plimpton, 875 Third Avenue, New York, New York
10022 at 10:00 A.M., New York time, on the date that is two business days
after the satisfaction or waiver by the appropriate party of the conditions
set forth in Sections 6.2, 6.3.3, 6.3.4, 6.4.5, and 6.4.6 or at such other
place, date and time as the parties shall have agreed to in writing.   
1  6   The date on which the Closing shall occur is hereinafter referred
to as the "CLOSING DATE." At the Closing:   (a) Resco and WMHI shall
deliver to the Purchaser stock certificates  representing the WWTI Shares and
the RPI Shares, respectively, endorsed or  accompanied by stock powers in
favor of the Purchaser, and accompanied by  all requisite stock transfer
stamps;   (b) the Purchaser shall deliver, by wire transfers of
immediately  available funds, the Initial Purchase Price, plus (x) an amount
equal to  the excess of the estimated adjusted combined stockholders\' equity
of WWTI  and its subsidiaries and RPI and its subsidiaries as of the close of
the  business day immediately preceding the Closing Date which estimate shall
be  prepared by Sellers in accordance with Section 1.3 and delivered to the 
Purchaser at least one business day prior to the Closing (the "ESTIMATED 
ADJUSTED CLOSING STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY") over $126,643,806 (the "ADJUSTED 
OFFER BALANCE SHEET STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY") or minus (y) an amount equal to 
the excess of the Adjusted Offer Balance Sheet Stockholders Equity over the 
Estimated Adjusted Closing Stockholders Equity in the respective portions 
and to the respective accounts designated by Resco and WMHI.   1.3 Purchase
Price Adjustments.   (a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Sellers
will prepare  and deliver to the Purchaser an unaudited combined balance
sheet of the  Companies and their subsidiaries as of the close of the
business day  immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "CLOSING BALANCE
SHEET"), which  shall be prepared on the basis of the same accounting
principles,  consistently applied, as those used in the preparation of the
unaudited  combined balance sheets of the Companies as of October 31, 1999
attached  hereto as Exhibit A (the "OFFER BALANCE SHEET"); provided that the
Closing  Balance Sheet shall not reflect (i) any liability for which the
Sellers are  liable under this Agreement or for which the Sellers have
indemnified the  Purchaser Indemnitees under this Agreement, including,
without limitation,  Taxes (as defined in Section 2.14) for which the Sellers
have agreed to  indemnify the Purchaser and its affiliates pursuant to
Section 4.4, (ii)  cash, (iii) any intercompany accounts canceled pursuant to
Section 4.10,  (iv) deferred taxes, (v) Excluded Changes to Reserves, and
(vi) the  $3,275,596 Providence, Rhode Island account receivable. The
Purchaser shall  cause each of the Companies and its subsidiaries and their
respective  employees (i) to assist the Seller in the preparation of the
Closing  Balance Sheet and (ii) to provide the Sellers and their
independent  auditors on-site access at all reasonable times to the
personnel,  properties, books and records of each of the Companies and its
subsidiaries  until final resolution of all matters in dispute under this
Section 1.3.   (b) During the 30-day period following the date of
Purchaser\'s receipt  of the Closing Balance Sheet, the Purchaser will be
permitted to review the  working papers of the Sellers relating to the
Closing Balance Sheet. The  Closing Balance Sheet will become final and
binding upon the parties on the  thirtieth day following the date of delivery
thereof, unless    2  7    the Purchaser delivers a written notice (the
"PURCHASER\'S NOTICE") to the  Sellers prior to such thirtieth day which
specifies in reasonable detail  the amount by which and the reasons why it
believes particular line items  in the Closing Balance Sheet either contain
mathematical errors or were not  prepared in accordance with the methodology
specified in the first sentence  of Section 1.3(a) and Section 1.3(e). The
Purchaser\'s Notice shall not  specify any other basis for disagreement with
the Closing Balance Sheet  other than as set forth in the preceding
sentence.   (c) If the Purchaser delivers a Purchaser\'s Notice in
accordance with  Section 1.3(b), then the parties shall, during the 30-day
period beginning  on the date of Seller\'s receipt of the Purchaser\'s
Notice, seek in good  faith to resolve in writing any differences which they
may have with  respect to the matters specified in the Purchaser\'s Notice.
If the  Purchaser and the Sellers are unable to resolve all of the
Purchaser\'s  objections within such 30-day period, then such unresolved
objections shall  be submitted to the Houston office of
PricewaterhouseCoopers (the "THIRD  PARTY ACCOUNTANT") for review and final
and binding resolution of any and  all matters that remain in dispute and
that were properly included in the  Purchaser\'s Notice. The Sellers and the
Purchaser shall use reasonable  efforts to cause the Third Party Accountant
to render a decision resolving  the matters in dispute within 30 days
following the submission of such  matter to the Third Party Accountant for
decision following such briefing  and other procedures as the Third Party
Accountant shall establish. The  Sellers and the Purchaser agree that
judgment may be entered upon the  determination of the Third Party Accountant
in any court having  jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be  enforced. The fees and expenses of the Third Party
Accountant shall be  borne by the Purchaser and the Sellers in inverse
proportion as they may  prevail on matters resolved by the Third Party
Accountant, which  proportionate allocations shall be determined by the Third
Party Accountant  at the time the determination of the Third Party Accountant
is rendered on  the merits of the matters submitted.   (d) Within 10 days
after (x) the Closing Balance Sheet becomes final  pursuant to Section 1.3(b)
or (y) the parties reach agreement pursuant to  Section 1.3(c) or (z) the
Third Party Accountant renders its decision  pursuant to Section 1.3(c), a
final adjustment to the Purchase Price will  be made as follows:   (i) if
the sum of the amount of adjusted combined stockholders\'  equity of WWTI and
its subsidiaries, and RPI and its subsidiaries, as  of the close of the
business day immediately preceding the Closing  Date as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.3(b) or (c)  ("AGGREGATE ADJUSTED FINAL STOCKHOLDERS
EQUITY") exceeds the Estimated  Adjusted Closing Stockholders Equity by
$100,000 or more, then the  Purchaser shall pay to the Sellers the amount of
such excess, by wire  transfer of immediately available funds to the account
or accounts  designated by the Sellers, and   (ii) if Aggregate Adjusted
Final Stockholders Equity is at least  $100,000 less than Estimated Adjusted
Closing Stockholders Equity,  then the Sellers shall pay    3  8    to
the Purchaser the amount of such deficit, by wire transfer of  immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by  the Purchaser.  
The parties agree that any difference between Aggregate Adjusted Final 
Stockholders Equity and Estimated Adjusted Closing Stockholders Equity that 
is less than $100,000 shall not give rise to any obligation to make an 
adjustment payment pursuant to this Section 1.3.   (e) For purposes of
Sections 1.2(b) and 1.3, "combined stockholders\'  equity" shall be
calculated in the same way, using the same methodologies  and accounting
practices (including with respect to determining estimates  and allowances)
as in the Offer Balance Sheet and, without limiting the  generality of the
foregoing, without giving effect to any pushdown of  goodwill or other merger
costs from WMI onto WWTI\'s books that may be  effected in respect of the
acquisition of the former Waste Management Inc.  or Eastern Environmental
Services Inc. and that was not reflected in the  Offer Balance Sheet. The
parties agree that, except to the extent Sellers  used an agreed-to net
working capital for the purpose of determining  adjusted combined
stockholder\'s equity at October 31, 1999, and as  otherwise set forth in
Section 1.3, the adjustment contemplated by Sections  1.2(b) and 1.3 is
intended to show the change, if any, in the combined  stockholders\' equity
of WWTI, RPI and their subsidiaries from the date of  the Offer Balance Sheet
to the close of the business day immediately  preceding the Closing Date, and
that, subject to such exceptions, such  change is to be determined by
calculating combined stockholders\' equity in  the same way, using the same
stipulated methodologies and accounting  practices (including with respect to
determining estimates and allowances),  at both dates. The scope of the
disputes to be resolved by the Third Party  Accountant will be limited to
whether such calculations were done in  accordance with this Section 1.3, and
whether there were mathematical  errors in the Closing Balance Sheets, and
the Third Party Accountant is not  to make any other determination, including
any determination as to whether  GAAP was followed for the Closing Balance
Sheet or the Offer Balance Sheet.   2. Representations and Warranties of the
Sellers. The Sellers and WMI represent and warrant to the Purchaser, on a
joint and several basis, as follows (references to the "DISCLOSURE LETTER"are

equitable principles.   2.2 No Conflicts; Consents and Approvals, etc.  
(a) Except as set forth in Section 2.2 of the Disclosure Letter, the

performance of its obligations hereunder will not result in (i) any  conflict
with such Seller\'s or WMI\'s certificate of incorporation or  by-laws, (ii)
subject to obtaining the consents referred to in Section  2.2(b), any
material (A) breach or violation of, (B) default under or (C)  giving of any
third party the right to modify, terminate or accelerate any  obligation
under, any law, statute, regulation, judgment, order, decree,  license,
permit or other governmental authorization or any mortgage, lease, 
agreement, deed of trust, indenture or any other instrument to which such 
Seller, WMI or either of WWTI or RPI or any of their respective  subsidiaries
is a party or by which any of them or their respective  properties or assets
are bound, or (iii) the creation or imposition of any  material liens,

Disclosure Letter, no  consent, approval or authorization of or filing with
any third party or any  governmental authority is required on the part of
either Seller, WMI or any  of WWTI, RPI or any of their respective
subsidiaries in connection with the  execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement or the consummation  of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except (i) filings required with  respect to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976 (the  "HSR ACT") and (ii) filings, consents or
approvals which, if not made or  obtained, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   2.3
Corporate Status of the Companies. Each of the Companies is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
its jurisdiction of incorporation. Each of the Companies has all requisite
corporate power and authority to conduct its business and to own or lease its
properties, as now conducted, owned or leased. Each of the Companies is duly
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so
qualified would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Sellers\' Disclosure
Letter, the Sellers have prior to the execution of this Agreement made
available to the Purchaser true and complete copies of (i) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, each as amended to date, of each of the Companies

each subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section 2.3 of the Sellers\'
Disclosure Letter, the stock certificate and transfer books and the minute

for inspection by the Purchaser prior to the date hereof) are true and
complete in all material respects.    5  10    2.4 The Company Shares.
The authorized capital stock of WWTI consists of 1,000 shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, all of which shares are issued and
outstanding and owned by Resco, free and clear of Liens. The authorized
capital stock of RPI consists of 1,000 shares of stock, all of which shares
are issued and outstanding and owned by WMHI, free and clear of Liens. WMI
owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Resco and WMHI. Except for the Company Shares, there are no shares
of capital stock or other equity securities of WWTI or RPI outstanding. The
Company Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and non-assessable. There are no outstanding options, warrants,
conversion or other rights or agreements of any kind (other than this
Agreement) for the purchase or acquisition from, or the sale or issuance by,
either Seller or either of the Companies of any shares of capital stock of
either of the Companies, and no authorization therefor has been given.
Assuming the Purchaser has the requisite power and authority to be the lawful
owner of the Company Shares, upon delivery to the Purchaser at the Closing of
certificates representing the Company Shares, duly endorsed by the applicable
Seller for transfer to the Purchaser, and upon Sellers\' receipt of the
Initial Purchase Price, good and valid title to the Company Shares will pass
to the Purchaser, free and clear of any Liens, other than those arising from
acts of the Purchaser or its affiliates.   2.5 Subsidiaries.   (a) The
authorized capital stock of each of the subsidiaries of WWTI  and each of the
subsidiaries of RPI is set forth on Section 2.5 of the  Disclosure Letter.
All such issued and outstanding shares are owned  directly or indirectly by
WWTI or RPI, as the case may be, free and clear  of all Liens, and have been
duly authorized and validly issued and are  fully paid and non-assessable and
no other such shares are outstanding.  There are no outstanding options,
warrants, conversion or other rights or  agreements of any kind for the
purchase or acquisition from, or the sale or  issuance by, either of WWTI or
RPI, or any of such subsidiaries of any  shares of capital Stock of any of
such subsidiaries, and no authorization  therefor has been given.   (b)
Each of the subsidiaries of WWTI and each of the subsidiaries of  RPI is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good  standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has all  requisite
corporate power and authority to conduct its business and to own  or lease
its properties, as now conducted, owned or leased, and is duly  qualified to
do business in each jurisdiction in which the failure to be so  qualified
would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on  such
subsidiary.   (c) None of WWTI, RPI or any of their respective subsidiaries
has any  equity interest or investment in any person other than as set forth
on  Section 2.5 of the Disclosure Letter.    6  11    2.6 Financial
Statements.   (a) The Sellers have made available to the Purchaser complete
and  correct copies of the unaudited combined statements of profit and loss
of  WWTI and its subsidiaries and of RPI and its subsidiaries as of, and
for  the years ending, December 31, 1996, 1997 and 1998, 1999 and as of, and
for  the ten months ending, October 31, 1999 and as of, and for the two
months  ending February 29, 2000 and the unaudited combined balance sheets of
WWTI  and its subsidiaries and of RPI and its subsidiaries as of December
31,  1998 and 1999 and as of October 31, 1999 and February 29, 2000 
(collectively, the "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS"). Except as set forth in Section 
2.6(a) of the Disclosure Letter, the Financial Statements present fairly in 
all material respects the financial condition and results of operations of 
the respective Company and its subsidiaries on a combined basis as of the 
dates and for the periods indicated, and have been prepared in accordance 
with GAAP consistently applied (except that the Financial Statements have 
been presented without any notes thereto, and the interim financial 
statements included in the Financial Statements do not include normal, 
recurring period-end adjustments (which, if included therein, would not, 
alone or in the aggregate, constitute a Material Adverse Effect)).   (b)
Section 2.6(b) of the Disclosure Letter accurately sets forth the  amounts
used in the preparation of the Adjusted Offer Balance Sheet  Stockholders
Equity for the balance sheet items set forth in Section 2.6(b)  of the
Disclosure Letter.   2.7 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except for
liabilities reflected or reserved against in the Financial Statements, or
disclosed in the Disclosure Letter, or which have been incurred in the
ordinary course of business since October 31, 1999 (none of which is a
liability for breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, or an
environmental liability) none of the Companies and their respective
subsidiaries has any liabilities, whether known or unknown, absolute, accrued
or contingent, other than liabilities or obligations that, individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.   2.8 Real Property; Assets.   (a) Section 2.8 of the Disclosure
Letter lists all items of real  property either owned by WWTI, RPI or any of
their respective subsidiaries  (the "OWNED REAL PROPERTY") or leased by WWTI,
RPI or any of their  respective subsidiaries (the "LEASED REAL PROPERTY").
Except as set forth  in Section 2.8 of the Disclosure Letter, the Companies
or their  subsidiaries have good and marketable title to the Owned Real
Property  listed on Section 2.8 of the Disclosure Letter and valid
leasehold  interests in the Leased Real Property listed on Section 2.8 of
the  Disclosure Letter, in each case, free and clear of all Liens, except
for  (i) Liens for Taxes and other governmental charges and assessments
which  are not yet due and payable or which are being contested in good faith
by  appropriate proceedings and for which appropriate reserves have been 
established to the extent required by GAAP, (ii) Liens of carriers, 
warehousemen, mechanics and materialmen and other like Liens arising in the 
ordinary course of business,    7  12    that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to  have a Material Adverse
Effect, (iii) easements, rights of way, title  imperfections and
restrictions, zoning ordinances and other similar  encumbrances affecting the
real property that do not materially impair the  continued use and operation
of the property to which they relate in the  business of the Companies as
currently conducted, (iv) statutory Liens in  favor of lessors arising in
connection with any property leased to either  of the Companies or their
respective subsidiaries, (v) Liens reflected in  the Financial Statements or
arising under the Contracts disclosed pursuant  to Section 2.9 and (vi) any
other Liens which do not materially impair the  use of properties affected
thereby ("PERMITTED LIENS").   (b) Each lease (including any option to
purchase contained therein)  pursuant to which WWTI, RPI or any of their
respective subsidiaries leases  any Leased Real Property listed on Section
2.8 of the Disclosure Letter  (the "LEASES") is in full force and effect.

except as to benefits accrued thereunder prior to such amendment or
termination.   2.10.2 ERISA. All Plans comply in all respects with the
requirements of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"CODE"), except for any failures to comply which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Except as set forth on Section 2.10.2 of the Disclosure Letter, no Plan is a
"Defined Benefit Pension Plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(35) of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
and no underfunded Defined Benefit Plan has been, during the five years
preceding the Closing Date, terminated or transferred out of the controlled
group of Companies (as defined in Section 414 of the Code) of which WMI,
either Company or any subsidiary is a member or was a member during the five
year period. No Defined Benefit Plan to which either Seller or any member of
the same controlled group of corporations as such Seller within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA contributes and which is subject to Part 3 of
Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA has incurred any "accumulated funding
deficiency" within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the
Code and no material liability (other than for annual premiums) to the

liability for any tax or penalty imposed by Title I or Title IV of ERISA or

the Disclosure Letter, there are no material pending or, to either Seller\'s
knowledge, threatened claims, suits, actions or investigations by or on
behalf of any of the Plans or by any employee involving any such Plan (other
than routine claims for benefits). All contributions, premiums and expenses
required to have been made by either Company or any of its subsidiaries to
all Plans under the terms of any such Plan or pursuant to any applicable
collective bargaining agreement or applicable law (including, without
limitation, ERISA and the Code) have been made within the time prescribed by
any such plan, agreement or law or accrued on the appropriate balance sheet.
Except as set forth on Section 2.10.2 of the Disclosure Letter, none of
the    12  17   Plans provides for medical or life insurance benefits
to current or future or retired or former employees of the Companies or any
other subsidiaries beyond their retirement or other termination of service
(other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code or applicable state
law) which would result in liability to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries. None of the Plans obligates the Company or any subsidiary to
pay any severance or similar benefit solely as a result of a change in
control or ownership which would result in liability under Section 280G of
the Code.   2.10.3 Disclosure. With respect to each Plan, the Sellers

thereof, has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its
qualification under the Code and to the effect that each such trust is exempt
from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and nothing has occurred
since the date of such determination letter that will adversely affect such
qualification or tax-exempt status.   2.10.5 Additional Benefits. Except as
set forth in Section 2.10.5 of the Disclosure Letter or as provided by
Section 5(c), the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not with respect to
any employee of either the Company or any of its subsidiaries (i) require
either Company or any of its subsidiaries to make a larger contribution to,
or pay greater benefits or provide other rights under, any Plan or any of the

Section 2.10.1 of the Disclosure Letter than it otherwise would, whether or
not some other subsequent action or event would be required to cause such
payment or provision to be triggered, or (ii) create or give rise to any
additional vested rights or service credits under any Plan or any of such
programs, agreements, policies, or other arrangements, whether or not some
other subsequent action or event would be required to cause such creation or
acceleration to be triggered.   2.10.6 No Vacation Carryover. To the extent
that the vacation policies of the Companies and their subsidiaries provide

person beyond that required under existing licenses and agreements without 
regard to consummation of such transactions. Except as set forth in Section 
2.11 of the Disclosure Letter the conduct of the businesses of either 
Company or any of its subsidiaries as presently conducted does not violate,

of directors of Purchaser, which constitutes all necessary corporate action
on the part of Purchaser for such authorization. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Purchaser and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its

license, permit or    21  26    other governmental authorization or any
mortgage, lease, agreement, deed of  trust, indenture or any other instrument
to which the Purchaser is a party  or by which (iii) the creation or
imposition of any Lien, except for such  breaches, violations or defaults and
such Liens which would not,  individually or in the aggregate, impair the
ability of the Purchaser to  fulfill its obligations hereunder.   (b)
Except as set forth in Section 3.2 of the Disclosure Letter, no  consent,
approval or authorization of or filing with any third party or  governmental

investigations involving the Purchaser that are pending or threatened, that

to be unreasonably withheld) by the other party and, in the event of any
disagreement between the Purchaser and the Sellers with respect to any such
Tax Return or calculation, such disagreement shall be resolved by the Third
Party Accountant using the procedures described below; provided that with
respect to any Tax Return described in clause (B) above that is not
a Continuing Return, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the
Sellers, subject only to the Third Party Accountant\'s determination that
there is not a reasonable basis for any position taken by the Sellers in such
Tax Return which has been disputed by the Purchaser as provided in this
Section 4.4(d). The determination by such Third Party Accountant shall be
final and binding on both the Purchaser and the Sellers. The fees and
expenses of the Third Party Accountant shall be borne by the Purchaser and
the Sellers in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by
the Third Party Accountant, which proportionate allocations shall be
determined by the Third Party Accountant upon its final resolution of the
matter. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Tax Returns described
in clause (A), (B) or (C) and the calculations described in clause (D) (each
of which is subject to the Pre-Filing Review Procedure described in this
Section 4.4(d)), shall be submitted to the reviewing party at least 30
business days prior to the due date (including extensions) of such Tax Return
and the reviewing party shall either complete their review or provide final
written comments on such Tax Return or calculation within 10 business days of
receipt. If the parties cannot resolve any disputes with respect to the
reviewing party\'s written comments within 5 business days of receipt
thereof, the dispute shall be submitted to the Third Party Accountant for
resolution. If the Third Party Accountant cannot resolve any
differences between the Sellers and the Purchaser with respect to such Tax
Return or calculation at least 5 business days prior to the due date of such
Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed as prepared by the party
responsible    28  33   for its preparation, and thereafter, to the
extent the Third Party Accountant resolves such dispute in a manner which
would require the amendment of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be
amended in a manner consistent with such resolution. Promptly upon resolution
by the Third Party Accountant and the filing of an amended Tax Return, the
liability of the Sellers and Purchaser for Taxes with respect to such Tax
Return shall be redetermined in a manner consistent with the provisions of
this Section 4.4, and any payments made between such parties prior to the
filing of such amended Tax Return shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such redetermination. The procedure described in this Section 4.4(d) shall be
referred to herein as the "Pre-Filing Review Procedure".   (e) Cooperation
of Sellers. To the extent reasonably requested by the Purchaser (or its
designees) in connection with the filing of any Tax Return, tax planning,
claim for refund or the conduct of any Tax Contest, the Sellers and their
affiliates shall grant to the Purchaser (or its designees) reasonable access
to the information, books and records relating to the Companies and
their respective subsidiaries within the possession of the Sellers or any
member of the Seller Group (including workpapers and correspondence with
taxing authorities), shall afford the Purchaser (or its designees) the right
(at the Purchaser\'s expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies
thereof, and shall provide the Purchaser reasonable access to their employees
who are knowledgeable regarding the relevant Tax matters.   (f) Cooperation
of Purchaser. To the extent reasonably requested by the Sellers (or their
designees) in connection with the filing of any Tax Return, tax planning,
claim for refund or the conduct of any Tax Contest, the Purchaser and its
affiliates shall grant, or cause the Companies and their respective
subsidiaries to grant, to the Sellers (or their designees) reasonable access
to the information, books and records relating to the Companies and
their respective subsidiaries within the possession of the Purchaser, the
Companies or their respective subsidiaries (including workpapers and
correspondence with taxing authorities), shall afford the Sellers (or their
designees) the right (at the Sellers\' expense) to take extracts therefrom
and to make copies thereof, and shall provide the Sellers reasonable access
to their employees who are knowledgeable regarding the relevant Tax matters.
The Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Companies or their subsidiaries to,
use its reasonable efforts to accurately and timely complete any tax
information package or questionnaire that is customary and consistent with
past practice submitted to it by the Sellers for the purpose of enabling the
Sellers to complete any Tax Return that the Sellers are required to prepare
pursuant to this Agreement.   (g) Cooperation Regarding Refunds. The
Purchaser and the Sellers shall cooperate, and they each agree to cause their
affiliates to cooperate with the other party, with respect to any reasonable
request to claim any refund of Taxes payable by or with respect to the
Companies and their subsidiaries, including the provision of all material
relevant information and reasonable assistance as reasonably requested;
provided that the requesting party shall reimburse the other party for any
costs incurred in complying with such requests. The Purchaser shall be
entitled to carryback any post-closing Tax attributes of either of the
Companies or their subsidiaries to any tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date and the Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in seeking any
such refunds of Taxes from the appropriate taxing authority, and Purchaser
shall be entitled to any    29  34   such refunds received by the
Purchaser or actually received by the Sellers or their affiliates or allowed
as an offset against Taxes otherwise payable by the Sellers or their
affiliates (net of any costs of the Sellers or their affiliates attributable
to the claim or receipt of such refunds) provided that the Sellers shall not
be obligated to amend returns previously filed.   (h) Tax Contests. Each of
the Purchaser and the Sellers shall promptly notify the other in writing
within 10 days from its (or its affiliates\') receipt of notice of any
pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax audits, litigation
or assessments or other contest of, or with respect to Taxes of, either
Company or any of its subsidiaries (a "TAX CONTEST"), so long as any taxable
periods of such Company or subsidiary ending on or prior to the Closing Date
remain open. The Sellers shall have the right to control the conduct
and disposition of any Tax Contest for taxable periods ending on or prior to
the Closing Date for which indemnification may be claimed against the Sellers
under this Agreement and to employ counsel of their choice at their expense.
With respect to any Tax Contest regarding a Tax Return in which the tax
attributes of either Company or any of its subsidiaries after the Closing
Date are determined by reference to the tax attributes of such Company or
subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall keep the
Purchaser informed as to the progress of any Tax Contest which the Sellers
have taken control of and the Purchaser shall have the right to consult with
the Sellers during such proceedings at its own expense; provided that the
Sellers shall not accept any proposed adjustment or enter into any settlement
or agreement in compromise or otherwise dispose of any such Tax Contest in a
manner that would purport to bind or would affect the tax liability or tax
attributes of either of the Companies or any of their subsidiaries for
taxable periods or portions thereof ending after the Closing Date without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. With respect to any Tax Contest (1) relating to any
Straddle Period or (2) for any tax period ending on or before the Closing
Date which the Sellers do not assume control of within a reasonable period of
time, such Tax Contests shall be controlled by Purchaser and the Purchaser
(x) shall keep the Sellers informed as to the progress of such Tax Contest
and (y) shall not accept any proposed adjustment or enter into any settlement
or agreement in compromise which would result in a claim for indemnification
against the Sellers pursuant to this agreement without the prior written
consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided that, in the case of any Tax Contest described in clause (2), if the
Sellers withhold their consent to the proposed adjustment or settlement or
agreement in compromise (as the case may be) for any reason, the
Sellers agree to assume control of such Tax Contest as soon as practicable;
provided further that, if the Sellers do not assume control of such Tax
Contest as soon as practicable, the Purchaser shall have the right in its
sole discretion to accept any proposed adjustment or settlement or agreement
in compromise with respect to such Tax Contest. The Purchaser and Sellers
shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
and their counsel in the conduct of any Tax Contest pursuant to this Section
4.4(h).   (i) Conduct of Business. On the Closing Date for the remaining
part of the day after the time of Closing, other than the transactions
contemplated hereby including the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the
Purchaser shall cause each Company and its subsidiaries to carry on its
business only in the ordinary course in substantially the same manner as
heretofore conducted.    30  35    (j) Transfer Taxes, etc. The
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, shall each be
responsible for the payment of one-half of all state and local transfer,
sales, use or other similar Taxes resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   (k) Tax Sharing Agreements. All tax
sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving either
of the Companies or any of their subsidiaries and any members of their
current affiliated group (as defined in Code section 1504(a)) shall be
terminated as of the time of the Closing and, after such time, neither of the
Companies nor any of their subsidiaries shall be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.   (l) Section 338(h)(10) Elections. The Purchaser, on
the one hand, and each Seller, on the other hand, shall make and shall cause
their respective affiliates to make a joint election pursuant to Section
338(h)(l0) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"),
(and any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign law) ("SECTION
338(h)(10) ELECTIONS") with respect to the purchase and sale of the stock of
each of the Companies and the deemed purchase and sale of stock of each of
the Companies\' subsidiaries hereunder (the "ELECTION CORPORATIONS") in the
manner described in this Section 4.4(l).   (i) No later than 30 business
days after the Initial Purchase  Price (as adjusted pursuant to Sections
1.2(b) and 1.3) and  liabilities of each Company and each Company\'s
subsidiaries (plus all  other relevant items) are finally determined pursuant
to the  provisions of this Agreement, the Purchaser shall provide to the 
Sellers a proposed calculation and allocation of the "aggregate deemed  sales
price" ("ADSP") for the deemed sale of assets resulting from the  making of
the Section 338(h)(l0) Elections with respect to the  Election Corporations.
For purposes of such calculation and allocation  (and for all other Tax
purposes of the Purchaser and the Sellers and  their affiliates), all amounts
payable pursuant to Section 1.2(b) (as  adjusted pursuant to Section 1.3)
hereof shall be (A) calculated for  purposes of ADSP and (B) allocated
amongst the Election Corporations  in accordance with the Code and
regulations thereunder and the  liabilities of the Election Corporations
shall be calculated for  purposes of ADSP and allocated to the appropriate
Election Corporation  in accordance with the Code and regulations thereunder.
If the Sellers  do not object within 10 business days after their receipt of
the  Purchaser\'s proposed calculation and allocation of ADSP, such 
calculation and allocation shall be treated as the agreed final  calculation
and allocation. If the Sellers object in writing to the  Purchaser\'s
proposed calculation and/or allocation of ADSP within 10  business days after
the receipt thereof, the Purchaser and the Sellers  shall use their best
efforts to agree on a calculation and allocation.  If the parties cannot,
within 30 business days, agree on a calculation  or allocation, all unagreed
items shall be submitted to the Third  Party Accountant for resolution;
provided that any such dispute shall  be resolved in favor of the Purchaser
unless the Third Party  Accountant determines (x) that the allocation of the
amounts payable  pursuant to Section 1.2(b) (as adjusted pursuant to Section
1.3) among  the Election Corporations or the calculation of ADSP, as the case
may  be,    31  36    has not been prepared in accordance with the
Code and regulations  thereunder or (y) in the case of any allocation of ADSP
among the  assets of an Election Corporation, that there is no reasonable
basis  for the Purchaser\'s position. Following the resolution of any such 
dispute, such calculation and/or allocation, as the case may be, shall  be
the final agreed calculation or allocation.   (ii) Promptly after ADSP is
finally determined pursuant to clause  (i) above and in no case later than 30
days prior to the date on which  the Election Forms are required to be filed
with the respective taxing  authority, the Purchaser, on the one hand, and
each Seller, on the  other hand, shall execute or shall cause their
respective appropriate  affiliates to execute and deliver to Purchaser four
(4) copies of  Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and any comparable election
forms  required under relevant state, local or foreign law (the "ELECTION 
FORMS") with respect to the sale of the Companies and each of their 
subsidiaries. Such Election Forms shall be prepared by the Purchaser  in a
manner consistent with the final agreed calculation and  allocation and as
reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the  Sellers. Such Election
Forms shall be filed with the Internal Revenue  Service and any other
appropriate taxing authorities not less than 15  days before the last date
for the filing thereof. In connection with  the filing of such Election
Forms, the Purchaser and the Sellers  agree, and shall cause their respective
affiliates to agree, to  cooperate (x) in the preparation of such Election
Forms and  attachments thereto to reflect the final determination of ADSP and
the  allocation thereof and to make any other corrections, amendments or 
supplements thereto which are mutually acceptable to the parties and  may be
required by law or otherwise necessary in making the Section  338(h)(10)
Elections and (y) to prepare and timely file any additional  forms or
attachments as may be required under state, local or foreign  law to make any
comparable elections thereunder. All such Election  Forms and any additional
forms or corrections, amendments or  supplements thereto shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with the  agreed final calculation and allocation
determined pursuant to clause  (i) above and any dispute with respect thereto
shall be resolved by  the Third Party Accountant in a manner consistent with
the procedures  and principles outlined in clause (i) above.   (iii) Except
as otherwise provided in clause (ii) above, the  Purchaser and the Sellers
shall not take, and shall not permit any of  their affiliates to take, any
action to modify the Election Forms  following the execution thereof, or to
modify or revoke the Section  338(h)(10) Elections following the filing of
the Election Forms,  without the written consent of the other. The Purchaser
and the  Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates to,
prepare  and file all Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the
information  contained in the Election Forms as filed, including the final
agreed  calculation and allocation, unless otherwise required by a change
in  Tax law requirements.    32  37    (iv) Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the  Sellers will include all items of gain and
loss attributable to the  deemed sale of the assets of each Company and each
Company\'s  subsidiaries in their consolidated and other income Tax Returns
and  the Sellers shall be responsible for, and shall pay, indemnify, defend 
and hold harmless Purchaser and its affiliates (including the Company  and
the subsidiaries) from and against, all Taxes of any Seller, the  Companies,
their respective subsidiaries or any affiliated group,  arising in any
taxable period that includes the Closing Date, that  result from the Section
338(h)(10) Elections.   (m) Indemnification. From and after the Closing
Date, the Sellers shall protect, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the
Purchaser, the Companies and their respective subsidiaries from any and all
Taxes imposed on a Company or any of its subsidiaries and Damages resulting
from (A) the several liability of a Company or any of its subsidiaries
pursuant to Treas. Reg. Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous state, local or
foreign law or regulation or by reason of its having been a member of any
consolidated, combined or unitary group on or prior to the Closing Date, (B)
its ceasing to be a member of the Seller Group, (C) the making of the Section
338(h)(l0) Elections, (D) the breach of the Sellers\' covenants set forth in
this Section 4.4, (E) breaches of representations and warranties in Section
2.14, or (F) any Tax allocation or Tax sharing or similar agreement, as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. The indemnification under
this Section 4.4(m) and the indemnification for Taxes set forth elsewhere in
Section 4.4 hereof shall not be subject to the indemnification deductible and
limit set forth in Section 7.2.1.   4.5 Supplements to Disclosures. From
time to time prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers may amend or supplement
the Disclosure Letter with respect to any matter hereafter arising or, in the
case of any representation and warranty qualified as to knowledge, discovered
that, if existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described therein or that is necessary to
complete or correct any information in any representation or warranty
contained in Section 2. For purposes of determining the fulfillment of the
condition precedent set forth in Section 6.4.1, no such amendment
or supplement shall be given effect; for all other purposes, including,
without limitation, Section 7.2.1, each such amendment and supplement shall
be given effect.   4.6 Contact with Customers and Suppliers. Except to the
extent necessary to comply with Section 4.8, neither the Purchaser nor any of
its agents, affiliates, employees, directors or officers shall contact
and communicate with any employees, customers, suppliers or licensors of
either Company and its subsidiaries in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby except with the prior written consent of the Sellers,
which consent may be conditioned upon an officer of either of the Sellers
being present at any such meeting or conference, among other conditions as
may be required by the Sellers.   4.7 Publicity. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be issued or made without the joint approval of the Sellers and
the Purchaser, unless required by law, rule or regulation (including stock
exchange rules)    33  38   (in the reasonable opinion of counsel) in
which case the Sellers and the Purchaser shall have the right to review such
press release or announcement prior to publication.   4.8 Release of
Guaranties, Bonds, etc.   (a) WWTI, RPI or certain Non-Company Affiliates
have (i) issued  certain guaranties and (ii) obtained certain surety or
performance bonds  with respect to which a Seller or one or more of such
affiliates has  reimbursement or indemnification obligations and, after the
date hereof and  prior to the Closing, WWTI, RPI or one or more of such
affiliates may, in  its sole discretion but after consulting with Purchaser,
in the ordinary  course of conduct of the Business, modify such guaranties or
issue  additional guaranties, or obtain additional bonds. Purchaser also 
acknowledges WWTI, RPI and/or one or more of such affiliates has been, or 
may be, required to furnish security for the benefit of the issuer or 
issuers of such bonds or in connection with such guaranties, including in 
the form of an irrevocable stand-by letter or letters of credit. Such 
guaranties and such additional guaranties, if any, and any security 
furnished in connection therewith, are referred to herein as the 
"GUARANTIES", and such bonds and such additional bonds, if any, and any 
security furnished in connection therewith, are referred to herein as the 
"BONDS". The Sellers have used reasonable efforts to list all Guaranties  and
Bonds outstanding as of the date hereof in Section 4.8 of the  Disclosure
Letter.   (b) Except for the Bonds and Guaranties marked with a number sign
on  Section 4.8 of the Disclosure Letter and for any Guaranties or Bonds
not  listed thereon, the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable
best  efforts and the Sellers and WMI shall cooperate (i) to obtain complete
and  unconditional release of each Seller and any relevant Non-Company
Affiliate  at the Closing with respect to all of the Guaranties and Bonds and
(ii) to  cause the issuer or issuers thereof to terminate and redeliver to
such  Seller or such Non-Company Affiliate any stand-by letters of credit
or  other security provided by such Seller or Non-Company Affiliate in 
connection with any such Guaranties or Bonds. The releases and terminations 
with respect to any Bond or Guarantee are referred to as a "GUARANTEE 
RELEASE" whether or not such release or termination occurs prior to the 
Closing. Bonds and Guaranties with respect to which a Guarantee Release has 
not been obtained are referred to as "OUTSTANDING".   (c) The Purchaser
shall post replacement bonds for each of the Bonds  set forth on Section 4.8
of the Disclosure Letter on or prior to the  Closing Date (each, a
"REPLACEMENT BOND"). At the Closing, the Purchaser  shall deliver (i) a fully
executed copy of each Replacement Bond (which  Replacement Bond shall state
prominently on its face the Bond which it is  replacing) and (ii) a copy of a
transmittal letter for each Replacement  Bond which shall have been sent to
the entity for which the Replacement  Bond is being posted requesting that
such entity release and return the  Bond which is being replaced.    34 
39    (d) With respect to each Bond and each Guarantee, the Purchaser
shall  indemnify and hold harmless each Seller and each Non-Company Affiliate
that  is party to, or has furnished security in connection with, such Bond
or  Guarantee from any and all losses, claims, liability or damage
(including  attorneys\' fees and other costs and expenses and including,
without  limitation, any increase in the liability of such Seller or any Non-
Company  Affiliate in respect of Taxes) in respect of any such Bond or
Guarantee,  including, without limitation, interest on any unreimbursed
payment made by  such Seller or such Non-Company Affiliate at the prime rate
posted by the  Chase Manhattan Bank from time to time plus 2% from the date
of payment  until the date reimbursed. If, as of 120 days after the Closing,
any Bond  set forth on Section 4.8 of the Disclosure Letter or Guarantee set
forth on  Section 4.8 of the Disclosure Letter marked with an asterisk (each,
a  "DESIGNATED OBLIGATION") remains Outstanding, the Purchaser shall
deliver  to the Sellers or to one or more Non-Company Affiliates designated
by the  Sellers an irrevocable, standby letter of credit (the "STANDBY LoC")
from a  bank or other financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the
Sellers  (the "ISSUER"), in an amount equal to the aggregate face amount of
such  Outstanding Designated Obligations. The Standby LoC shall have the 
following terms and conditions:   (i) The Standby LoC shall be for an
initial term of one year  following 120 days following the Closing Date and
shall provide that  it shall be automatically renewed from time to time at
each renewal  date thereafter for an additional one-year term unless and
until all  Outstanding Designated Obligations shall have been terminated.
The  Standby LoC shall further provide that the Issuer shall give the 
Sellers notice not more than 60 nor less than 30 days prior to each  renewal
date whether the Standby LoC has been renewed for an  additional year and, if
it has been renewed, the amount for which it  has been renewed;   (ii) The
Sellers shall be entitled to draw upon the Standby LoC  upon presentation of
a sight draft of either Seller accompanied by a  certificate of such Seller
stating that (x) a claim in respect of any  of the Designated Obligations has
been asserted against such Seller or  any Non-Company Affiliate, or (y)
Purchaser shall not have notified  the Sellers at least 30 days prior to any
scheduled renewal date that  either (A) the Standby LoC has been renewed, or
(B) all Outstanding  Designated Obligations have been terminated (and all
security  furnished in connection therewith shall have been released and 
redelivered to the Sellers on such Non-Company Affiliate) and  delivered to
the Sellers satisfactory evidence of such termination;   (iii) The right of
any Seller to draw upon the Standby LoC and to  receive any notices relating
thereto shall be assignable by such  Seller in whole or part (from time to
time and at any time), without  the consent of Purchaser to any affiliate of
such Seller or any  trustee or agent for lenders to such Seller or any of its
affiliates.   (iv) Following the provision of confirmation to the Sellers
of  the release of any Designated Obligations, Purchaser shall be entitled 
to reduce the amount of the    35  40    Standby LoC by the face amount
of the Standby LoC maintained in  respect of the obligation released.   (e)
Following the Closing, if there shall exist any Outstanding  Guaranties or
Bonds:   (i) The Purchaser will use its reasonable efforts to obtain the 
complete and unconditional release each of Seller and any Non-Company 
Affiliate with respect to such Outstanding Guaranties and Bonds  (whether by
replacement of such Guaranties and Bonds or otherwise) to  the extent the
Purchaser has knowledge thereof. The reasonable efforts  obligations in the
immediately preceding sentence shall not include  the obligation to pay
consideration.   (ii) The Purchaser shall promptly pay to the Sellers,
after  receipt by Purchaser of any invoice therefor, all reasonable  out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of the Sellers and any such  Non-Company Affiliate
(to the extent relating to any period of time  after the Closing) relating to
Outstanding Guaranties and Bonds which  shall be deemed to include, without
limitation, all fees, expenses and  other amounts payable under credit and
bonding arrangements in respect  thereof, in each case until the complete and
unconditional release of  the Sellers\' and such Non-Company Affiliates\'
obligations with respect  thereto.   (iii) If the Standby LoC has not been
automatically renewed as  provided in Section 4.8(c)(i), then the Purchaser
shall cause the  Standby LoC to be renewed each year, for an amount equal to
not less  than of the aggregate face amount of such Outstanding Designated 
Obligations at the time of renewal plus the amount of any unreimbursed 
drawings or payments thereunder as of the date of such renewal, and 
Purchaser shall pay all fees, costs and expenses relating to each such 
renewal.   (iv) So long as any Bond or Guaranty is Outstanding, the 
Purchaser shall not permit such Bond or Guaranty or any obligation  secured,
assured or guarantied by such Outstanding Bond or Guaranty to  be amended,
modified, changed, assigned or otherwise transferred,  renewed or extended
(except insofar as the beneficiary of any such  Outstanding Bond or Guaranty
or obligation has the unilateral right on  the date hereof to take such
action) without the consent of WMI, such  consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, provided that it shall be  reasonable for WMI to withhold its
consent if such action would  increase the risk of such Outstanding Bond or
Guaranty being called  upon or extend the period of time during which such
Outstanding Bond  or Guaranty could be called upon.   4.9 Transition
Services. For a period of time following the Closing Date as determined by
the Purchaser, but in no event to exceed 180 days, the Sellers or their
affiliates shall continue to provide to the Companies and their respective
subsidiaries the services listed in Section    36  41   4.9 of the
Disclosure Letter on a reasonable cost basis (including reasonable allocated
overhead expense) and otherwise on the terms and conditions set forth in
Section 4.9 of the Disclosure Letter.   4.10 Intercompany Accounts. All
intercompany accounts between either Company or any of its subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and any Seller or any Non-Company Affiliate, on the other hand
("INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS"), shall be canceled as of the close of business on
the business day immediately preceding the Closing Date, and such
cancellations shall be reflected in the Closing Balance Sheet. The
Intercompany Accounts shall be settled as follows: (a) to the extent that
either Company and its subsidiaries are indebted to any Seller or any Non-
Company Affiliate, such debt shall be canceled and the amount of the debt so
canceled shall be deemed a capital contribution by such Seller to
such Company, and (b) to the extent that any Seller or any Non-Company
Affiliate is indebted to any Company and its subsidiaries such debt shall be
canceled and the amount of the debt so canceled shall be deemed a dividend
from such Company to such Seller.   4.11 Indemnification of Directors and
Officers. The Purchaser shall cause each Company and its subsidiaries to
honor their obligations to indemnify and advance defense costs to each
present and former officer or director of the Company and its subsidiaries
pursuant to its By-Laws and shall not permit the Certificate of Incorporation
or By-Laws of any Company or any of its subsidiaries to be amended for a
period of seven years in a manner which adversely affects the indemnification
rights of present and former directors and officers of such Company or any of
its subsidiaries, except as required by applicable law.   4.12 Right to Use
Certain Marks.   (a) To the extent that any trademarks, service marks, brand
names or  trade, corporate or business names of either Seller or of any Non-
Company  Affiliate ("SELLER MARKS") are used by either Company or any of
its  subsidiaries on stationery, signage, equipment, invoices, receipts,
forms,  packaging, advertising and promotional materials, product, training
and  service literature and materials, software or like materials ("MARKED 
MATERIALS") or appear on either Company\'s or any of its subsidiaries\' 
inventory at the Closing, such Company and its subsidiaries may use such 
Marked Materials or sell such inventory for a period of six months after  the
Closing, but the Purchaser shall not without prior written consent of  the
Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, use such  Seller
Marks in any other manner during the time thereafter.   (b) Within 60 days
after the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause each  Company and its
subsidiaries not to use any Marked Materials (other than  training materials
or software for internal use only with respect to which  the last sentence of
this paragraph (b) shall apply) without first crossing  out or marking over
such Seller Marks or otherwise clearly indicating on  such Marked Materials
that such Company and its subsidiaries are no longer  affiliates with either
Seller or any Non-Company Affiliate. After the  Closing the Purchaser shall
procure that the Companies and their respective  subsidiaries do not reorder
any Marked Materials.    37  42    Within 180 days following the
Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the  Company and its subsidiaries to
discontinue all use of Seller Marks or  Marked Materials.   (c) As promptly
as practicable and in any event within 180 days  following the Closing, the
Purchaser shall cause each Company and its  subsidiaries to change (if
necessary) its corporate name to a name that  does not include the Seller
Marks.   4.13 Confidentiality. The Sellers shall keep confidential, and
cause their affiliates and instruct their officers, directors, employees and
advisors to keep confidential, all information relating to the Companies and
their subsidiaries and their businesses, except as required by law or
administrative process, except as may be required or advisable in connection
with the assertion or defense of any claim under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, and except for information which is available to the
public on the Closing Date, or thereafter becomes available to the public
other than as a result of a breach of this Section 4.13.   4.14 Assignment
of Confidentiality Agreements. On the Closing Date, the Sellers shall, and
shall cause their affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
assign, to the extent assignable, to the Purchaser their rights under all
confidentiality agreements entered into by either Seller or its affiliates
with any person in connection with the proposed sale of the Companies to the
extent such rights relate to the Companies and the subsidiaries. Copies of
all such confidentiality agreements shall be provided to the
Purchaser promptly following the Closing Date.   4.15 Resignations. On the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall cause to be delivered to the Purchaser duly
signed resignations (from the applicable board of directors), effective
immediately after the Closing, of all directors of each Company and each
wholly owned subsidiary and shall take such other action as is necessary to
accomplish the foregoing.   4.16 Other Transactions. From the date of this
Agreement to the Closing, neither Seller, neither Company, nor WMI, nor any

Purchaser shall cause the Companies and their subsidiaries following
the Closing to provide the Sellers reasonably prompt written notice whenever
a Customer for which the Companies or their subsidiaries do not have a
customer contract as of the date hereof executes and delivers a
contract    39  44   with the Companies or their subsidiaries;
provided, however, that such obligation shall only continue so long as such
person would continue to be classified as a Customer hereunder.   4.18.2
WMI Agreement Regarding Backup Landfill Agreements. WMI covenants and agrees
that, with respect to each Customer for which the Companies or their
subsidiaries have a Backup Landfill Agreement, WMI or a subsidiary of WMI

disposed of in the landfill specified in  the Backup Landfill Agreement for
such Customer;   (b) the Companies and their subsidiaries shall pay to WMI
or its  subsidiaries a price for the Backup Disposal Services equal to the
price  set forth in the Backup Landfill Agreement for such Customer; provided
that  for any period following one year after the Closing Date for which
such  Backup Landfill Agreement has not specified a price, the price shall be
the  price specified in such Backup Landfill Agreement for the most recent 
period for which a price has been specified escalated from such recent 
period to that later period by the Consumer Price Index applicable to the

provide the Backup Disposal Services to the Companies and their subsidiaries
consistent with the terms set forth in the Backup Landfill Agreements.  
4.18.3 Commitment Regarding Backup Landfill Agreements. If a Company or its
subsidiary has a Need for Landfill Services for Residuals generated by
a Customer for which such Company or subsidiary has a Backup Landfill
Agreement in place, such Company shall (or shall cause such subsidiary to)
meet such Need for Landfill Services pursuant to a Backup Landfill Agreement
or pursuant to the Backup Disposal Services provided in Section 4.18.2
hereof.   4.18.4 Preferred Provider Agreement. For Customers of the
Companies and their subsidiaries other than Customers for which a Backup
Landfill Agreement is in place, each Company shall, and shall cause its
subsidiaries to, for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
the third anniversary of the Closing Date (except with respect to Customers
for which WMI is prohibited from competing pursuant to Section 4.18.1, in
which case the period shall continue until termination of such prohibition),
meet its Need for Landfill Services by engaging WMI or its subsidiaries so
long as the "all-in" pricing offered by WMI and its subsidiaries (i.e.,
inclusive of    40  45   tipping fees, etc.) and the other material
contract terms offered by WMI and its subsidiaries are at least as favorable
as the lowest available "all-in" pricing and other material contract terms
available from any third party. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
Companies and their subsidiaries shall notify WMI or its subsidiaries in
writing of the lowest bid they received to satisfy a Need for Landfill
Services and shall give WMI or its subsidiaries a reasonable opportunity to
respond to such bid.   4.18.5 Preferred Pricing Agreement. If, during the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of
the Closing Date, WMI or its subsidiaries agree to or offer to provide
landfill disposal services with respect to Residuals originating from a
Customer to any person other than the Companies or their subsidiaries, WMI or
its subsidiaries shall provide the Companies with a written offer to provide
the same services on the same terms to the Companies except that the price
for landfill disposal (exclusive of charges which are passed-through from a
person that is not an affiliate, taxes and transportation costs) shall be 10%
lower than the price (exclusive of charges which are passed-through from a
person that is not an affiliate, taxes and transportation costs) offered to
or agreed to with such other person. Such offer shall remain open to the
Companies as long as the offer is open to such other person.   4.18.6
Disputes. Upon the reasonable request of WMI or the Companies, the other
party shall provide to a designated executive officer of the requesting party
(who, in the case of WMI shall be the Vice President of Sales and Marketing,
and who, in the case of the Purchaser, shall be an Executive Vice President,
each, a "DESIGNATED OFFICER") reasonably requested
documentation demonstrating compliance with the provisions of Section 4.18.4

contrary herein, the Purchaser shall have the right, beginning on the date
hereof and ending upon a termination, if any, of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, to participate in and manage the Marshall Case on a day-to-
day basis; provided that, until the Closing Date, the Sellers shall have
final decision-making authority and control of the Marshall Case except that,
for sixty days following the date hereof, (i) the Marshall Case may not be
settled or otherwise compromised without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, which consent may be withheld for any reason and (ii) the Sellers
shall continue to prosecute the case in the ordinary course of business with
the same counsel employed prior to the date hereof. Until the Closing Date,
the Purchaser and the Sellers shall consult with each other as to the

with Section 7.2.3(a).   4.23 The Projects. WMI and the Sellers shall, and
shall cause each of the Companies and its subsidiaries to,   (a) consult

subsidiaries with respect thereto including any  material decisions to be
made regarding a Project; and   (b) provide the Purchaser the right to
consent to the submission of a  "best and final offer" for each Project which
consent may be withheld for  any reason.  If the Purchaser does not consent
to the Companies\' submission of a "best and final offer" for a Project, (i)
the Companies and their subsidiaries shall not take further actions to
undertake or make commitments with respect to such Project and (ii) the
Sellers shall then have the option to cause the Companies to assign to the
Sellers or other Non-Company Affiliates the rights of the Companies and its
subsidiaries to undertake such Project.   4.24 Permits. WMI and the Sellers
shall, and shall cause each of the Companies and its subsidiaries to, use

Plans.   (a) Each employee of either Company or any of its subsidiaries who
is  actively employed immediately prior to the Closing Date and who is
entitled  to any compensation, benefits or other payments arising in
connection with  such employee\'s employment with either Company or any of
its subsidiaries  shall be referred to as the "COMPANY EMPLOYEES." From and
after the  Closing, the Sellers shall remain solely responsible for
liabilities for  claims of the Company Employees and their eligible
dependents incurred  prior to the Closing Date under those Company plans that
are health,  short-term disability, accident or life insurance    42 
47    plans and the Purchaser shall be solely responsible for all such 
liabilities for claims incurred by any Company Employee and his eligible 
dependents on or after the Closing Date.   (b) Effective from and after the
Closing, the Purchaser shall cause  each Company Employee (and his covered
dependents) who participated in an  employee welfare benefit plan (as such
term is defined in Section 3(1) of  ERISA) or similar benefit arrangement
maintained by WMI (the "WMI WELFARE  PLANS") immediately prior to the Closing
Date to be eligible to participate  effective immediately in a similar
employee welfare benefit plan or  arrangement maintained by Purchaser or its
subsidiaries for the benefit of  similarly situated employees of the
Purchaser or its subsidiaries  ("PURCHASER\'S WELFARE PLANS"), but only to
the extent that such similar  Plans and arrangements are currently maintained
by Purchaser or its  subsidiaries. In connection therewith, the Purchaser
shall cause the  Purchaser\'s Welfare Plans to disregard, with respect to
such previously  covered Company Employees (and their covered dependents),
pre-existing  condition exclusions and limitations. In addition, with respect
to each  Company Employee (and his eligible dependents) who did not
participate in a  particular WMI Welfare Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date, such  Company Employee (and his eligible dependents) shall
become eligible to  participate in Purchaser\'s Welfare Plans in accordance
with the terms of  the Purchaser\'s Welfare Plans. Nothing hereunder shall be
construed to  require Purchaser to hire, or either Company or any of its
subsidiaries to  retain, Company Employees for any period of time; and
provided further,  that Company Employees (and their eligible dependents)
shall be eligible to  participate in the Purchaser Welfare Plans only during
the period of time  during which such Company Employees are employed by the
Purchaser, either  Company or any of its subsidiaries or as required by
applicable law.   (c) All Company Employees who have account balances in the
Waste  Management Retirement Savings Plan (the "WMI PLAN") immediately prior
to  the Closing Date shall be fully vested in all of their account balances 
under the WMI Plan as of the Closing Date including, without limitation,  any
account balances attributable to employer contributions. As soon as 
practicable after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall make all matching and 
other contributions with respect to Company Employees that are payable with 
respect to periods before the Closing Date whether or not such  contributions
are due. As soon as practicable after the Closing Date,  employees of each
Company and its subsidiaries who were participants in the  WMI Plan and who
are actively employed on the Closing Date shall be  eligible to commence
participation in a tax-deferred savings plan  maintained by the Purchaser
(the "PURCHASER 401(K) PLAN"). Prior to the  Closing Date, each of the
Purchaser and the Sellers shall deliver to the  other party a favorable
determination letter from the IRS regarding the  qualified status of the
Purchaser 401(k) Plan or WMI Plan, as the case may  be. The Sellers will
permit each employee who is a participant in the WMI  Plan to elect (i) to
receive a distribution of the value in his account  less the amount of any
outstanding loan to such participant under the Plan  (such participant\'s
"ACCOUNT BALANCE"), (ii) to roll over such  participant\'s Account Balance to
an individual retirement account of such  participant or (iii) to roll over
such participant\'s Account Balance (but  for purposes of this clause (iii),
a participant\'s Account Balance shall  include the amount of any outstanding
loan under the    43  48    WMI Plan which loan shall also be rolled
over) to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan  as soon as practicable after the Closing
Date and the Purchaser shall cause  the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to accept such
transfers. The Seller and  Purchaser shall cooperate to the extent necessary
and reasonable to  facilitate such transfer and loan payments.   6.

Purchaser shall only be entitled to indemnification in respect of (i) item 4
in Section 2.13 of the Disclosure Letter to the extent the Damages related to
such item exceed $155,000 and (ii) each of items 5, 6 and 7 in Section 2.13
of the Disclosure Letter to the extent the Damages related to such item
exceed $50,000; and   (f) any payments due to employees and former employees
of the Companies and their subsidiaries ("EMPLOYEE OBLIGATIONS") under (1)
stock option plans and other incentive equity plans (including rights to cash
payments arising therefrom) and (2) employee retention bonus or severance
plans or agreements in place prior to the Closing which provide for payments
to employees of the Companies and their subsidiaries in connection with the
transaction contemplated hereby, including (A) all agreements providing for
severance if an employee is terminated within a set period of time following
a change of control transaction and (B) all of the items set forth on Section
2.10.5 of the Disclosure Letter, in each case other than payments due
pursuant to employment contracts entered into in the ordinary course of
business and not in contemplation of this or a similar transaction or
payments pursuant to the general severance policies of the Companies and
their subsidiaries under which the rights of participants to severance are
based on length of service and not a change of control.   The rights of the
Purchaser Indemnitees to indemnification under Section 7.2.1 shall be limited
as follows:   (A) No Purchaser Indemnitee shall be entitled to be
indemnified in respect of any Damages to the extent such Purchaser Indemnitee
shall have been compensated therefor in connection with the purchase price
adjustment pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof through a reduction in the
Aggregate Adjusted Final Stockholders Equity on the Closing Balance Sheet.
There shall not be any duplicative payments or indemnities by any Seller.  
(B) The amount of any Damages incurred by Purchaser Indemnitees shall be
reduced by the net amount the Purchaser Indemnitees recover (after
deducting all attorneys\' fees, expenses and other costs of recovery) from
any insurer or other party liable for such Damages, and the Purchaser, on
behalf of the Purchaser Indemnitees, shall use reasonable efforts to effect
any such recovery; provided that the amount of indemnity obligation offset
pursuant to this paragraph (B) shall not exceed 50% of the Purchaser\'s
aggregate insurance coverage limits; and provided further that the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall not be obligated to make such an insurance claim if the
cost of pursuing such an insurance claim together with any corresponding
increase in insurance premiums    49  54   or other chargebacks to such
Purchaser Indemnities, as the case may be, would exceed the value of the
claim for which such Purchaser Indemnitee is seeking indemnification; and
further provided that the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to be paid
by the Sellers pursuant to this Section 7 as provided in this Section 7
without waiting for the receipt of any insurance proceeds which might offset
any obligation hereunder in which case the Purchaser shall pay over to the
Sellers the amount of such insurance proceeds upon receipt by
the Purchaser.   (C) The Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
indemnification under Section 7.2.1(a) with respect to a breach of the
covenants set forth in Section 4.2(ix) or Section 4.2(xi) or a breach of
representation or warranty (i) except to the extent that the aggregate amount
of the Damages (reduced as provided in paragraph (A) and (B) above) in
respect of any individual breach of a representation and warranty or of the
covenants set forth in Section 4.2(ix) or 4.2(xi) exceeds $25,000 (the "MINI-
BASKET"), and if such breach does not exceed $25,000, it shall not count
toward satisfying the aggregate deductible in clause (ii) hereof, and (ii)
unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages in respect of such
claims against the Sellers under Section 7.2.1(a) exceeds $4.04 million (the
"DEDUCTIBLE"), in which event the Sellers shall only be liable for such
excess. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Mini-Basket and Deductible shall
not apply to the breach of a representation or warranty in Sections 2.1, 2.3,
2.4, 2.5, 2.6(b), 2.14, or 2.19 or the voluntary breach of the covenants set
forth in Section 4.2(ix) or Section 4.2(xi).   (D) After the Closing, the
Sellers\' maximum aggregate liability to the Purchaser Indemnitees under this
Section 7.2.1 or otherwise under this Agreement shall not, except to the
extent arising under Section 1.3 (Purchase Price Adjustments), Section 4.4
(Tax Matters), Section 4.18 (Non-Competition and Conduct of Business),
Section 7.2.1(c) (RTH Farms), Section 7.2.1(d) (ERISA) or Section 7.2.1(f)
(Additional Benefits), exceed $67.33 million.   7.2.2 By the Purchaser. From
and after the Closing, the Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
each Seller, each Non-Company Affiliate and each director, officer or
employee of any of the foregoing (collectively, "SELLER INDEMNITEES") from
and against any Damages incurred or sustained by Seller Indemnitees as a
result of (i) the breach by the Purchaser of any covenant, representation or
warranty set forth in this Agreement, (ii) any liability arising from the
Marshall Case after the Closing Date and (iii) any liability or obligation of
any Seller or any Non-Company Affiliate for any obligation or liability of
whatever kind or nature, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, absolute
or contingent, known or unknown, whether or not accrued, whether arising
before, on or after the Closing Date, of either Company or any of its
subsidiaries, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to any Seller in
respect of any items that such Seller has expressly agreed to pay or
perform or any Damages to the extent the Purchaser is entitled to
indemnification therefor pursuant to Section 7.2.1, provided, further, that
there shall not be any duplicative payments or indemnities by the Purchaser.
The amount of any Damages incurred by Seller Indemnitees shall be reduced by
the net amount the Seller Indemnitees recover (after deducting all
attorneys\' fees, expenses and other costs of recovery from any insurer or
other party liable for such Damages, and the Sellers, on behalf of the Seller
Indemnitees, shall use reasonable efforts to effect any such recovery.   
50  55    7.2.3 Indemnification Procedures. A party entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall herein be referred to as an "INDEMNITEE." A
party obligated to indemnify an Indemnitee hereunder shall herein be referred
to as an "INDEMNITOR."   (a) Third Party Claims. Within 20 business days
after an Indemnitee  receives notice of any third party claim or the
commencement of any action  by any third party (each, a "THIRD PARTY
ACTION"), such Indemnitee shall,  if a claim in respect thereof is to be made
against an Indemnitor under  Section 7, notify such Indemnitor in writing
specifically referring to this  Section 7.2.3(a) and in reasonable detail of
such claim or action and  include with such notice copies of all notices and
documents (including  court papers) served on or received by the Indemnitee
from such third  party. A third party claim existing on the date hereof shall
also be  considered a "Third Party Action" for purposes of this Section
7.2.3,  provided that the Indemnitee shall not be required to give the
Indemnitor  notice of such claim. Upon receipt of such notice, the Indemnitor
shall be  entitled to participate in such claim or action, to assume the
defense  thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, and
to  settle or compromise such claim or action, provided that if the
Indemnitee  is permitted to elect to be represented by separate counsel
pursuant to the  provision to the following sentence, such settlement or
compromise shall be  effected only with the consent of the Indemnitee, which
consent shall not  be unreasonably withheld or delayed. After notice to the
Indemnitee of the  Indemnitor\'s election to assume the defense of such claim
or action, the  Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnitee under
Section 7 for any  legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
Indemnitee in  connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of  investigation, provided that the Indemnitee shall have the right to
employ  one counsel on behalf of all Indemnitees to represent it if either
(x) such  claim or action involves remedies other than monetary damages and
such  remedies, in the Indemnitee\'s reasonable judgment, could have a
material  adverse effect on such Indemnitee or (y) the Indemnitee may have
available  to it one or more defenses or counterclaims which are inconsistent
with one  or more defenses or counterclaims which may be alleged by the
Indemnitor,  and in the case of clause (y) the fees and expenses of such
separate  counsel shall be paid by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor does not
elect  to assume the defense of such claim or action within 20 days of the 
Indemnitee\'s delivery to notice of such a claim or action, the Indemnitee 
shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof. If the Indemnitor assumes 
such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the 
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from  the
counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood that the  Indemnitor
shall control such defense. The Indemnitor shall be liable for  the fees and
expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee for any period  during which
the Indemnitor has failed to assume the defense thereof (other  than during
the period prior to the time the Indemnitee shall have given  notice of the
third party claim as provided above). Unless it has been  conclusively
determined through a final judicial determination (or  settlement tantamount
thereto) that the Indemnitor is not liable to the  Indemnitee under this
Section 7.2.3, the Indemnitee shall act reasonably  and in accordance with
its good faith business judgment with respect to  such defense, and shall
not    51  56    settle or compromise any such claim or action without
the consent of the  Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.  The parties hereto agree to render to each other such
assistance as may  reasonably be requested in order to insure the proper and
adequate defense  of any such claim or action, including making employees
available on a  mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation  of any relevant materials or to testify at any proceedings
relating to such  claim or action. The indemnification required by Sections
7.2.1 and 7.2.2  shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof
during the course  of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are
received or loss,  liability, claim, damage or expense is incurred.  
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Purchaser shall have 
the right upon express written notice to the Sellers to assume the defense 
of and take full decision-making control over any Third Party Action for 
which the Purchaser Indemnitees are indemnified under this agreement, 
provided that if the Purchaser exercises such right, the Sellers and WMI 
shall be relieved of their indemnification obligations hereunder with 
respect to such Third Party Action other than costs incurred prior to the 
assumption.   (b) Other Claims. In the event an Indemnitee sustains any
Damages not  involving a third party claim or action which such Indemnitee
reasonably  believes may give rise to a claim for indemnification from an
Indemnitor  hereunder, such Indemnitee shall deliver notice of such claim to
the  Indemnitor, which notice of claim shall specifically refer to this
Section  7.2.3(b) and shall specify with reasonable detail the basis on
which  indemnification is being asserted and the amount of such Damages.
The  failure by any Indemnitee so to notify the Indemnitor shall not relieve
the  Indemnitor from any liability which it may have to such Indemnitee
under  Section 7.2.1 or 7.2.2 except to the extent that the Indemnitor 
demonstrates that it has been materially prejudiced by such failure. If the 
Indemnitor does not notify the Indemnitee within 30 calendar days following 
its receipt of such notice that the Indemnitor disputes its liability to  the
Indemnitee under this Section 7, such claim specified by the Indemnitee  in
such notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnitor  under
this Section 7 and the Indemnitor shall pay the amount of such claim  to the
Indemnitee on demand or, in the case of any-notice in which the  amount of
the claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later  date when the
amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes  finally determined.
If the Indemnitor has timely disputed its liability  with respect to such
claim, as provided above, the Indemnitor and the  Indemnitee shall proceed in
good faith to negotiate a resolution of such  dispute and, if not resolved
through negotiations, such dispute shall be  resolved by litigation in an
appropriate court of competent jurisdiction in  accordance with Article 9 of
this Agreement.   7.2.4 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payment. The Sellers and
the Purchaser agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to Sections
4.4 and 7.2 as an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes
unless otherwise required by law.    52  57    7.2.5 Exclusivity of
Indemnification Provision. The indemnity provided for in Section 4.4 and in
this Section 7 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Purchaser and
the Sellers after the Closing for any inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty of the other party or any failure or breach of any Pre-Closing
Covenant (other than claims of, or causes of action arising from, fraud) In
furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby waive, from and after
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and
all rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes
of action arising from, fraud), any Company or any subsidiary of a Company
may have against the other party or its affiliates relating to any inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty of the other party or any failure or breach
of any Pre-Closing Covenant arising under or based upon any Federal, state or
local law, ordinance, rule or regulation or otherwise (except pursuant to
the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement).   8. General
Provisions.   8.1 Modification; Waiver. This Agreement may be modified only
by a written instrument executed by the parties hereto. Any of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement may be waived in writing at any time on or
prior to the Closing Date by the party entitled to the benefits thereof.  
8.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the schedules, exhibits
and Disclosure Letter (including the schedules to the Disclosure Letter)
hereto is the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements, understandings,
documents, projections, financial data, statements, representations and
warranties, oral or written, express or implied, between the parties hereto
and their respective affiliates, representatives and agents in respect of the
subject matter hereof, except that this Agreement does not supersede, unless
and until the Closing occurs, the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms and
conditions of which the parties hereto expressly reaffirm.   8.3 Certain
Limitations. It is the explicit intent and understanding of each of the
parties hereto that neither party nor any of its affiliates, representatives
or agents is making any representation or warranty whatsoever, oral or
written, express or implied, other than those set forth in Sections 2 and 3
and neither party is relying on any statement, representation or
warranty, oral or written, express or implied, made by the other party or
such other party\'s affiliates, representatives or agents, including, without
limitation, any such statement, representation or warranty contained in any
offering memorandum or any information, document or-material made available
to the Purchaser in certain "data rooms", management presentations or any
other form in expectation of the transactions contemplated hereby, except for
the representations and warranties set forth in such Sections 2 and 3. EXCEPT
AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PARTIES
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION AS TO CONDITION,
MERCHANTABILITY OR SUITABILITY AS TO ANY OF THE ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS AND,
EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, IT IS
UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PURCHASER TAKES THE ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS "AS IS" AND
"WHERE IS". The parties agree that this is an    53  58   arm\'s
length transaction in which the parties\' undertakings and obligations
are limited to the performance of their obligations under this Agreement.
The Purchaser acknowledges that it is a sophisticated investor, that it
has undertaken a full investigation of the Business, and that it has only
a contractual relationship with the Sellers, based solely on the terms of
this Agreement, and that there is no special relationship of trust or
reliance between it and either Seller; provided that nothing in the foregoing
sentence shall be deemed to impute knowledge of any fact or circumstance not
disclosed in the Disclosure Letter to the Purchaser or to modify any
representation or warranty made herein.   8.4 Termination.   (a) This
Agreement may be terminated: (i) at any time prior to the  Closing Date by
mutual consent of the Purchaser and the Sellers; (ii) by  the Purchaser or
the Sellers if the Closing shall not have taken place on  or before 120 days
after the date hereof (the "DROP-DEAD DATE"); provided,  however, that if the
failure of the Closing to take place on or before the  Drop-Dead Date is due
to the failure to receive a termination or expiration  of the waiting period
under the HSR Act, the Drop-Dead Date shall be  automatically extended to the
date which is 10 business days following the  termination or expiration of
the waiting period under the HSR Act, provided  that such date shall not be
extended beyond December 31, 2000; or (iii) by  either the Purchaser or the
Sellers by written notice to the other party if  any event, fact or condition
shall occur or exist that shall have made it  impossible to satisfy a
condition precedent to the terminating party\'s  obligations to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement  (other than the conditions
set forth in Section 6.4.5), and such event,  fact or condition shall not
have been cured by the non-terminating party or  waived by the terminating
party within 30 days, unless the occurrence or  existence of such event, fact
or condition shall be due to the failure of  the terminating party to perform
or comply with any of the agreements or  covenants hereof to be performed or
complied with by such party prior to  the Closing, provided that with respect
to any termination pursuant to the  foregoing clauses (ii) and (iii), the
non-occurrence of the Closing is not  attributable to a breach of the terms
hereof by the party seeking  termination.   (b) In the event of termination
by the Sellers or the Purchaser  pursuant to this Section 8.4, written notice
thereof shall forthwith be  given to the other party and the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement shall be terminated without further action by
either party. If  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
terminated as provided  herein:   (i) The Purchaser shall return to the
Sellers all documents and  other materials received from the Sellers, and
their respective  affiliates and agents (and shall destroy all copies of or
materials  developed from any such documents or other materials) relating to
the  transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the 
execution hereof; and    54  59    (ii) All confidential information
received by the Purchaser with  respect to the Sellers and their respective
affiliates shall be  treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement
which shall  remain in full force and effect notwithstanding the termination
of  this Agreement.   (c) If this Agreement is terminated as provided in
this Section 8.4,  this Agreement shall become null and void and of no
further force or  effect, except for the Confidentiality Agreement as amended
by the last  sentence of Section 4.3, Section 4.7 relating to publicity, and
Section 8.5  relating to certain expenses. Nothing in this Section 8.4 shall
be deemed  to release any party from any liability for any breach by such
party of the  terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right
of any party  to compel specific performance by any other party of its
obligations under  this Agreement.   (d) If (i) all of the conditions to
Close set forth in Section 6.2 and  6.4 have been satisfied except for the
condition set forth in Section 6.4.5  (Financing) and (ii) thereafter the
Sellers or the Purchaser terminate this  Agreement pursuant to clause (ii) of
Section 8.4(a), upon 15 days written  notice from the Sellers, the Purchaser
shall pay to the Sellers $1,000,000.   8.5 Expenses. Except as expressly
provided herein, whether or not the transactions contemplated herein shall be
consummated, each party shall pay its own expenses incident to the
preparation and performance of this Agreement, provided that Sellers shall
have no obligation to reimburse the Purchaser or any Purchaser Indemnitees
with respect to any such expenses borne by the Company to the extent
reflected in the Financial Statements or incurred thereafter and reflected in
the accounting records of the Companies or their subsidiaries and, if
appropriate, accrued on the Closing Balance Sheet.   8.6 Further Actions.

and take such other actions as may reasonably be requested by the other party
in order to consummate or implement the transactions contemplated hereby.  
8.7 Post-Closing Access. In connection with any matter relating to any period
prior to, or any period ending on, the Closing, the Purchaser shall, upon the
request and at the expense of the Sellers, permit the Sellers and
their representatives full access at all reasonable times to the books,
records and personnel of the Companies and its subsidiaries, and the
Purchaser shall execute (and shall cause the Company and their respective
subsidiaries to execute) such documents as the Sellers may reasonably request
to enable the Sellers to file any required reports or Tax Returns relating to
the Companies or any of their subsidiaries, to defend any litigation
involving any Seller or any Non-Company Affiliate or otherwise for a valid
business purpose. The Purchaser shall not dispose of such books and records
during the seven-year period beginning with the Closing Date without the
Sellers\' consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Following the
expiration of such seven-year period, the Purchaser may dispose of such books
and records at any time upon    55  60   giving 60 days\' prior written
notice to the Sellers, unless the Sellers agree to take possession of such
books and records within 60 days at no expense to the Purchaser.   8.8

the Closing to one or more of its lenders for collateral security
purposes (and such lender may exercise all of the rights and remedies of the
Purchaser hereunder) or any of its affiliates, any assignment by any party

references to the Sellers\' knowledge or the knowledge of either Seller shall
mean the actual knowledge of the persons listed on Section 8.12 of the
Disclosure Letter and obtained in the normal course of their respective
duties as officers of a Seller or a Company. The disclosure of any matter in

this Agreement to which the relevance of the disclosure is reasonably
apparent, but shall expressly not be deemed to constitute an admission by
either Seller or the Purchaser, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter
is material for the purposes of this Agreement. The terms "include,"
"includes" and "including" shall    57  62   be deemed followed by
"without limitation." References herein to the Purchaser and its subsidiaries

ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM ANY CONTROVERSY OR CLAIM  ARISING OUT OF OR

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT NEITHER PARTY HERETO WAIVES  THE RIGHT TO RECOVER ANY

PARTY CLAIM.   (b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY
WHICH MAY  ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND
DIFFICULT  ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY  RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY  OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE 
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.   (c) EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,  AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR  OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,  SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF THE FOREGOING
WAIVERS, (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS AND  HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
