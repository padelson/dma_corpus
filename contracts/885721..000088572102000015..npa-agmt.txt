extent, if any, that adjustment is required pursuant to Section 1.5.   (ii)
The term "NON-ESCROWED AMOUNT" shall mean the Adjusted Base Purchase Price,

"2001 EBITDA" shall mean (x) the earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciationand amortization of the Companies, determined on a combined and
transaction-adjusted basis (as described in Section 2.9(a)), for the year
ended December 31, 2001, based on the amounts of such earnings, interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization as set forth on the 2001 Audited Income
Statement (as defined herein) plus (y) the salary and bonus expense
attributable to the Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2001, to the
extent that such salary and expense was deducted in calculating the earnings
described in clause (x).   (ii) "POSITIVE EBITDA ADJUSTMENT" shall mean
five (5) times the amount, if any, by which the 2001 EBITDA exceeds fifty
nine million dollars ($59,000,000).   (iii) "NEGATIVE EBITDA ADJUSTMENT"
shall mean five (5) times the amount, if any, by which forty nine million
dollars ($49,000,000) exceeds the 2001 EBITDA.   (b) Upon receipt of the

($49,000,000) and not greater than fifty nine million dollars ($59,000,000),
there shall be no adjustment of the Base Purchase Price pursuant to this
Section 1.5 and the Adjusted Base Purchase Price shall be deemed to equal the
Base Purchase Price. If the 2001 EBITDA is greater    4   than fifty
nine million dollars ($59,000,000), the Adjusted Base Purchase Price shall
equal the Base Purchase Price plus the Positive EBITDA Adjustment. If
the 2001 EBITDA is less than forty nine million dollars ($49,000,000), the
Adjusted Base Purchase Price shall equal the Base Purchase Price minus the
Negative EBITDA Adjustment.   Section 1.6 ADJUSTMENT OF THE ADJUSTED BASE
PURCHASE PRICE.   (a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date
(but in any event within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days after the
Closing Date), ESI will prepare a statement of the Combined Working Capital
of the Companies as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the
"PRELIMINARY CLOSING DATE WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT"). Such statement of the
Combined Working Capital shall be prepared in the form of the statement
annexed hereto as EXHIBIT D. The Shareholders\' Agent agrees to provide
reasonable assistance to ESI and its advisors in connection with the
preparation of the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Statement. ESI
shall deliver to the Shareholders\' Agent the Preliminary Closing Date
Working Capital Statement, together with such back-up information as the
Shareholders\' Agent shall reasonably request, promptly after the Preliminary
Closing Date Working Capital Statement has been prepared.   (b) For purposes
of this Agreement, the term "COMBINED WORKING CAPITAL" means the combined
current assets of the Companies less the combined current liabilities of the
Companies (such assets and liabilities to be determined in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a basis
consistent with the balance sheet included within the Interim Financial
Statements (as defined herein) except as otherwise provided in this Section
1.6(b)); provided that (i) such assets and liabilities shall be calculated on
a "transaction-adjusted basis" (as defined in Section 2.9), (ii) current
liabilities shall exclude the current portion of long-term Indebtedness and
any liabilities arising from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections (as
defined herein) and (iii) the Combined Working Capital shall be calculated
after repayment of Indebtedness of the Companies, after deduction of all
Permitted Payments (whether or not triggered as of the Closing Date) and
after payment of the Closing Cash Distribution. For purposes of this
Agreement, "INDEBTEDNESS" shall mean the aggregate amount of all of the
Companies\' indebtedness for borrowed money (including accrued but unpaid
interest), whether owed to a bank or any other Person (including the
indebtedness set forth on SCHEDULE 2.25(C) to the Disclosure Letter), but

leases.   (c) The Shareholders\' Agent shall have thirty (30) calendar days
following receipt of the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital
Statement during which to notify ESI of any dispute of any item contained in
the Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Statement, which notice (the
"OBJECTION NOTICE") shall be in writing and shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such dispute. If ESI does not receive notice of any such
dispute within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the Preliminary Closing
Date Working Capital Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Closing Date
Working Capital Statement (as hereinafter defined). The Parties shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve any such dispute as promptly as possible,
and upon such resolution (which shall be set forth in writing and signed by
ESI and the Shareholders\' Agent), the Final Closing Date Working Capital
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with such written resolution.  
5    (d) If the Parties are unable to resolve any disputes regarding the
Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Statement that were described in the
Objection Notice within fifteen (15) calendar days (or such longer period as
ESI and the Shareholders\' Agent shall mutually agree in writing) of ESI\'s
receipt of the Objection Notice, ESI and the Shareholders\' Agent shall
thereafter promptly engage KPMG LLP or, if such firm is unwilling or unable
to serve, ESI and the Shareholders\' Agent shall engage another
mutually acceptable "Big 5" or regional accounting firm (the firm utilized
pursuant to this Section 1.6(d), the "ARBITRATOR") to resolve such disputes
and such resolution shall be final and binding on the Parties. The Parties
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitrator to complete
its work within thirty (30) calendar days of its engagement. The expenses of
the Arbitrator shall be shared equally between ESI (I.E., 50%) and the
Sellers (i.e., 50%). The Preliminary Closing Date Working Capital Statement,
as finally determined pursuant to this Section 1.6, is referred to herein as
the "FINAL CLOSING DATE WORKING CAPITAL STATEMENT". For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "FINAL CLOSING DATE WORKING CAPITAL" shall mean the
Combined Working Capital, as reflected on the Final Closing Date Working
Capital Statement.   (e) If the Final Closing Date Working Capital exceeds
negative eleven million dollars (-$11,000,000) (the "TARGET WORKING

Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, together with
interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of interest announced publicly
from time to time by Citibank, N.A. as its prime rate from (and including)
the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of such payment. If the Final
Closing Date Working Capital is less than the Target Working Capital, the
Adjusted Base Purchase Price shall be reduced by the amount of such
difference and the Shareholders\' Agent shall cause the Sellers to promptly
pay such difference to ESI by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
together with interest thereon at a rate equal to the rate of
interest announced publicly from time to time by Citibank, N.A. as its prime
rate from (and including) the Closing Date to (but excluding) the date of
such payment.   Section 1.7 SECURITIES MATTERS.   (a) The Shareholders
acknowledge that the ESI Shares to be issued and delivered to the
Shareholders hereunder will not be registered under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES Act"), and will not be registered or

TRANSFER IS  EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION. SUCH SHARES ARE SUBJECT TO TRANSFER 
RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN A STOCK AND ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT, DATED  AS OF
FEBRUARY 5, 2002, BY AND AMONG THIS CORPORATION AND CERTAIN  PERSONS."  
6    (b) The Shareholders will not sell, pledge or otherwise transfer the

instructions to its transfer agent consistent with this Section 1.7 and shall
cooperate with any transfer request made by the Shareholders that is

contemplated in this Agreement to be effected on or prior to March 10, 2002
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and will cooperate fully with
each other and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
counsel, accountants and other designees in connection with any steps
required to be taken to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation:   (a) Each of the Parties as
promptly as practicable will effect all necessary registrations and filings
with appropriate Governmental Entities and will take all actions necessary,
proper or advisable under applicable Laws to obtain any required approval of
any Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (except that ESI shall have no obligation to take or
consent to the taking of any action required by any such Governmental Entity
that could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect ESI or any
of the Companies, the properties and assets of ESI or any of the Companies or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the divestiture of any assets of ESI or any of the Companies)).
Each of the Parties will furnish all information required for any application
or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If the    
35   Department of Justice ("DOJ") or the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC")
should make a "Second Request" for information, each of the Parties will
supply (or, in the case of the Sellers, cause the Companies to supply) the
information requested, at its own expense, as soon as practicable.   (b)
Each of the Parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider
in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other federal, state
or foreign antitrust or fair trade law.   (c) The Parties agree to cooperate
and use all reasonable best efforts to defend against any claim, action,
suit, investigation or other proceeding commenced prior to the Closing that
questions the validity or legality of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or seeks damages in connection therewith, and, if an injunction or
other order is issued in any such action, suit or other proceeding, to use
all reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or other order lifted and
to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (d) The Shareholders
will give any notices to third parties and use their reasonable best efforts
(in consultation with ESI) to obtain any third party consents (i) necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (ii) required to prevent a Company Material Adverse Effect,
whether prior to or after the Closing Date.   (e) Each Party will give
prompt notice to the other Parties of (i) the occurrence, or failure to
occur, of any event which occurrence or failure could be reasonably likely to
cause any representation or warranty of the Sellers or ESI, as the case may
be, contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect (or, with respect to representations and warranties qualified herein
as to materiality, to be untrue or inaccurate in any respect) at any time
from the date hereof to the Closing Date or that will or may result in the
failure to satisfy any of the conditions, prior to Closing, specified in
Article V of this Agreement and (ii) any failure of any Seller or Company or
ESI, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by any of them under this
Agreement. The Sellers acknowledge that ESI does not and will not waive
any rights it may have under this Agreement as a result of any such
notifications. ESI acknowledges that the Sellers do not and will not waive
any rights they may have under this Agreement as a result of any such
notifications.   (f) Prior to the Closing, the Shareholders shall cause
the names of NPA of Texas, Inc. and NPA Pharmacies Inc. to be changed to
names not including the name "NPA" or the phrase "National Prescription
Administrators", and as soon as practicable (but in no event more than thirty
days) after the Closing, the Shareholders shall cause such entities to cease
using the name "NPA", the phrase "National Prescription Administrators" or
any other name (other than "NVA", "National Vision Administrators", "NPAX",
"NPP" or "National Plastic Printing, Inc.") confusingly similar to either
"NPA" or "National Prescription Administrators".    36    4.1.2 PUBLIC
ANNOUNCEMENTS; CONFIDENTIALITY. Subject to their respective legal obligations
(including requirements or procedures of stock exchanges and other
Governmental Entities), prior to Closing, the Parties shall consult with one
another regarding the timing and content of all public announcements
regarding any aspect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby to the financial community, employees and customers of the Companies
or the general public and shall agree upon the content of any such public
announcement prior to its release. Any such public announcement may list the
names of the Companies and shall refer to the transaction as
"an acquisition", but shall, under no circumstances, list the names of
the Shareholders, provided that this Section 4.1.2 shall not preclude the
Parties from filing this Agreement as an exhibit to any filings or reports to
the SEC, Nasdaq National Market System ("NASDAQ"), the FTC or the DOJ (with
respect to filings under the HSR Act) or as otherwise required by law.  
4.1.3 TAX MATTERS.   (a) TAX PERIODS ENDING ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE.
The Shareholders\' Agent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Companies for all periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after the Closing Date. The
Shareholders\' Agent shall permit ESI to review and comment on each such Tax
Return described in the preceding sentence prior to filing, and shall not
file any such Tax Returns without the prior written consent of ESI, which
consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, each Shareholder shall include any income, gain, loss,
deduction, or other Tax items for such periods on his or her Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the Schedule K-1s furnished by the relevant Company to
the Shareholders for such periods. ESI shall pay the Shareholders, within 15
days after receipt, an amount equal to any Tax refund or credit paid with
respect to the Companies that relate to any period ending on or before the
Closing Date, except any Tax refund or credit shown on the face of the Final
Closing Date Working Capital Statement.   (b) TAX PERIODS BEGINNING BEFORE
AND ENDING AFTER THE CLOSING DATE. ESI shall prepare or cause to be prepared,
and file or cause to be filed, any Tax Returns of the Companies for Tax
periods which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date.
The Shareholders\' Agent shall have the right to review and comment on such
Tax Returns.   (c) S CORPORATION STATUS. The Companies (other than NY
IPA, which is not an S corporation) and the Shareholders have not revoked and
will not, from the date hereof until the Closing Date, revoke the elections
of the Companies (other than NY IPA) to be taxed as S corporations within the
meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code or any corresponding state or
local elections. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the Companies
(other than NY IPA) and the Shareholders will not take or allow any action
(other than the sale of stock pursuant to this Agreement) that would result
in the termination of the status of the Companies (other than NY IPA) as
validly electing S corporations within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362
of the Code (or any corresponding provision of state, local or foreign income
Tax law).   (d) COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS. ESI, the Shareholders, and
the Companies shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes.     37   Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other Party\'s request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder. ESI and the Shareholders agree (i) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies relating
to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration
of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by ESI or the
Shareholders, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods,
and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other Party reasonable written notice
prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records
and, if the other Party so requests, ESI or the Shareholders, as the case may
be, shall allow the other Party to take possession of a copy of such books
and records.   (e) SECTION 338(H)(10) ELECTIONS. At ESI\'s option,
the Companies (other than NY IPA) and each of the Shareholders will join with
ESI in making an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any
corresponding elections under state, local, and foreign Tax law)
(collectively, the "SECTION 338(H)(10) ELECTIONS") with respect to the
purchase and sale of the stock of the Companies (other than NY IPA)
hereunder. The Shareholders shall cooperate with ESI in taking all actions
necessary and appropriate (including filing such forms, returns, elections,
schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve
timely Section 338(h)(10) Elections. At the Closing or within a reasonable
time thereafter, each Shareholder shall deliver to ESI duly executed
signature attachments to an IRS Form 8023 for each of the Companies (other
than NY IPA), together with any state Tax forms specified by ESI as necessary
to effectuate the Section 338(h)(10) Elections. Each Shareholder will include
his or her proportionate share of any income, gain, loss, deduction or other
Tax item resulting from the Section 338(h)(10) Elections on his or her
Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Law.   (f) ALLOCATION OF
PURCHASE PRICE. The Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Companies (plus
other relevant items) will be allocated to the assets of the Companies for
all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting purposes) pursuant to a
schedule to be prepared by ESI as soon as practicable, provided, however that
(i) the inventory of the Companies will be valued at the Companies\' cost and
(ii) the portion of the Purchase Price ascribed to each Company in Section
1.2 shall be allocated among the assets of such Company in accordance with
such schedule. Such schedule shall be provided to the Shareholders\' Agent at
least at least seventy-five (75) calendar days prior to the due date (after
taking into account all available extensions of such due date) for the filing
of any Gross-Up Tax Returns (as hereinafter defined). ESI, the Companies, and
the Shareholders will file all Tax Returns (including amended returns and
claims for refund) and information reports in a manner consistent with such
allocation.   (g) GROSS-UP PAYMENT. If a Section 338(h)(10) Election is
made with respect to any Company, each Shareholder of such Company shall be
entitled to receive an additional cash payment (the "GROSS-UP PAYMENT") from
ESI to compensate such Shareholder for any additional income Taxes paid by
the Shareholder for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date as a
result of such Section 338(h)(10) Elections, including additional income
Taxes payable by the Shareholder as a result of the receipt of the Gross-Up
Payment; provided, however, that to the extent such additional Taxes result
from (i) the     38   application of a provision of state or local
income Tax law corresponding to Section 1374 of the Code or (ii) a change by
the Sellers (other than as provided for in Section 9.18) in the allocation of
the Purchase Price from that set forth in Section 1.2, no Gross-Up Payment
shall be made. For all relevant Tax, accounting and other purposes, the
Parties shall treat the Gross-Up Payments as adjustments to the Purchase
Price under this Agreement. In order to be entitled to a Gross-Up Payment
attributable to any Taxes, the Shareholders\' Agent must, at least thirty
(30) calendar days prior to the due date (after taking into account all
available extensions of such due date) for the filing of any Tax Returns of
any Shareholder relating to such Taxes (collectively, "GROSS-UP
TAX RETURNS"), (a) submit such Gross-Up Tax Returns to ESI for review, and
(b) submit a claim (a "GROSS-UP CLAIM") to ESI, setting forth the amount of
the Gross-Up Payment and a reasonably detailed explanation of the method used
to compute such amount, accompanied by a statement from a certified
public accounting firm confirming such amount. Each Gross-Up Claim shall be
disposed of in accordance with Section 4.1.4.   (h) CERTAIN TAXES. All
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes
and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with
the transfer of the shares of the Companies, the Owned Real Property, the LLC
Leased Real Property, the Airport Property (as hereinafter defined), the
Leased Real Property, the LP Owned Equipment, the LP Leased Equipment and the
Equipment Lease (including any transfer or similarly applicable Tax imposed
in other states or subdivisions), shall be paid one-half by the Sellers and
one-half by ESI when due, and the Shareholders will, at their own expense,
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes
and fees, and, if required by applicable law, ESI will, and will cause its
affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation; provided, however, that with respect to the real property
transfer Taxes applicable to the transfer of the New Jersey Owned Real
Property hereunder, ESI will pay $50,000 of such Taxes and the Sellers shall
pay the balance of such Taxes.   (i) TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. All Tax sharing
agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving any of the
Companies shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing
Date, the Companies shall not be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder.   4.1.4 DISPUTE RESOLUTION. ESI shall have twenty (20) calendar
days following the receipt of any Gross-Up Claim during which to notify the
Shareholders\' Agent of any dispute regarding (i) a manifest error in
the Gross-Up Claim, (ii) a manifest error in the Gross-Up Tax Return or (iii)
one or more discretionary determinations in the Gross-Up Tax Return that
are inconsistent with the purchase price allocation provided for herein
which, in the case of clause (iii), have the effect of increasing the Gross-
Up Payment to an amount in excess of the amount the Gross-Up Payment would
have been had such Gross-Up Return been prepared in accordance with such
purchase price allocation (any such determination, a "DISCRETIONARY
DETERMINATION"). If ESI does not notify the Shareholders\' Agent of any such
dispute within such twenty (20) calendar day period, ESI shall be deemed not
to have any objection to such Gross-Up Claim, and ESI shall pay the Gross-Up
Payment to the Shareholders\' Agent upon the filing of the relevant Gross-Up
Tax Return. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any such
dispute regarding the amount of a Gross-Up Claim as promptly as possible. If
ESI and the Shareholders\' Agent are unable to resolve any such dispute
within fifteen (15) calendar days (or such     39   longer period as
ESI and the Shareholders\' Agent may mutually agree in writing) of a notice
of dispute, either party may submit the matter to KPMG LLP or, if such firm
is unwilling or unable to serve, ESI and the Shareholders\' Agent
shall engage another mutually acceptable "Big 5" or regional accounting firm
to determine whether any such manifest error or Discretionary Determination
has occurred and, if it concludes that such manifest error or
Discretionary Determination has occurred, to resolve such dispute, and the
determination by such accounting firm with respect to any such dispute shall
be final and binding. If such accounting firm concludes that such a
Discretionary Determination has been made, the Gross-Up Tax Return shall be
changed so that such Discretionary Determination is consistent with the
purchase price allocation provided for herein and does not increase the
Gross-Up Payment to an amount in excess of the amount that the Gross-Up
Payment would have been had such Gross-Up Tax Return been prepared in
accordance with such purchase price allocation. In the absence of such
manifest error or Discretionary Determination, the applicable Gross-Up Tax
Return shall be deemed to be prepared in accordance with this Agreement and
the Gross-Up Claim submitted by the Shareholders\' Agent shall be binding
upon ESI. The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
accounting firm to complete its work within thirty (30) calendar days of its
engagement. The fees and expenses of such accounting firm shall be shared
equally between ESI (i.e., 50%) and the Shareholders (i.e., 50%).   4.1.5
SECTION 1031 EXCHANGE. The LP may desire to exchange, for other property of
like kind and qualifying use within the meaning of Section 1031 of the Code
and the Regulations promulgated thereunder, fee title in the Owned Real
Property. The LP expressly reserves the right to assign its rights, but not
its obligations, hereunder to a Qualified Intermediary as provided
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4), with respect to one or
more parcels of Owned Real Property, on or before the Closing Date. In the
event that the LP assigns its rights hereunder pursuant to this Section
4.1.5, the LP agrees to notify ESI in writing of such assignment at or before
Closing. If the LP assigns its rights under this Agreement for this purpose,
ESI agrees to (i) consent to such assignment, (ii) pay the portion of the
Purchase Price allocable to the parcels of Owned Real Property to be
exchanged to a Person designated by the LP, which person, in the opinion of
the LP, constitutes a Qualified Intermediary, provided that (A) such payment
shall satisfy ESI\'s obligation to make payment for the parcels of Owned Real
Property that are so exchanged, (B) ESI incurs no additional costs, expenses,
liabilities, obligations or other financial exposure with respect to the
parcels of Owned Real Property that are so exchanged or the Section 1031
Exchange, (C) neither the Section 1031 Exchange nor the assignment of the
portion of the Purchase Price allocable to the parcels of Owned Real Property
that are so exchanged, as discussed above, relieves the LP of any of its
duties or obligations herein and ESI\'s rights under this Agreement are
preserved to the reasonable satisfaction of ESI, and (D) ESI has no liability
or obligation to the LP for the failure of the contemplated exchange to
qualify as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Code.   4.1.6
TRANSITION AGREEMENTS. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
at the Closing, ESI shall cause NPA to enter into, and ESI shall thereafter
cause NPA to perform, the following agreements with Affiliates of the
Sellers:   (a) An agreement with National Plastic Printing, Inc. to supply
NPA\'s requirement for plastic cards substantially in the form and substance

administered by NPA can be operated by NVA, PVMS or Newco, substantially in
the form and substance of the agreement annexed hereto as EXHIBIT F; and  
(c) An agreement to provide third party claims administration services to
NPAX, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, substantially in the form and substance
of the agreement annexed hereto as EXHIBIT G.   4.1.7 LABOR MATTERS. The
Parties will cooperate in communicating with the applicable unions in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.   Section 4.2

action at its own expense.   Section 7.2 BREAK-UP FEE. If, for any reason,
ESI should be unable to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
solely because it is unable to consummate the Financing, ESI shall pay to the
Sellers a fee (the "BREAK-UP FEE") in the amount of twenty five million
dollars ($25,000,000) as and for liquidated damages, it being understood that
the Sellers\' damages resulting from ESI\'s failure to close because of
ESI\'s inability to consummate the Financing would be too difficult to
measure; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Break-Up Fee is not payable, and ESI
will not be liable for such payment, if a material cause of ESI\'s failure to
consummate the Financing results from a breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by the Sellers in this Agreement (a "SELLER
REPRESENTATION") or any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking made
by the Sellers in this Agreement or the inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty made by ESI to its lenders based on a Seller Representation. The
payment of the Break-Up Fee shall represent the Sellers\' sole recourse
should ESI be unable to close the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
because it is unable to consummate the Financing.   Section 7.3 EFFECT OF
TERMINATION. In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Article VII, this Agreement will forthwith become void and there will be no
liability on the part of any Party or its respective partners, members,
officers, directors or shareholders, except for obligations under Section
4.1.2 (Public Announcements, Confidentiality), Section 7.2 (Break-up Fee),
Section 9.15 (Transaction Costs), this Section 7.3 and the confidentiality
agreements previously executed by the Parties, all of which will survive the
Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as provided in
Section 7.2, nothing contained in this Agreement will relieve any Party
from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination.   ARTICLE VIII  INDEMNIFICATION   Section 8.1
INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLERS. Subject to the limitations
contained in Sections 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6, from and after the Closing Date, the
Sellers will, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless ESI,
each of the Companies and each of their respective Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives and each of the heirs,
executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the
"ESI INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") from, against and in respect of any and all
claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, costs, expenses, penalties, fines
and judgments (at equity or at law) and damages whenever    
56   arising or incurred (including, without limitation, amounts paid in
settlement, costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses) by them and arising out of or relating to:   (a) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the Sellers in this
Agreement;   (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or undertaking
made by the Sellers in this Agreement to be performed prior to the Closing,
including without limitation any covenant in Section 4.1.3 to be performed
prior to the Closing;   (c) any breach of: (i) the Sellers\' covenants,
agreements and undertakings set forth in Article I and (ii) the Sellers\'
covenants, agreements and undertakings set forth in the following Sections of
this Agreement to be performed on or after the Closing: Section 4.1.1(f)
(Names), Section 4.1.3 (Tax Matters), Section 4.1.5 (Section 1031 Exchange),
Section 4.2.9 (Shareholder Releases), Sections 4.2.10 (Brokerage Fees),
Section 4.2.11 (Confidentiality), Section 4.2.12 (Sellers\' Non-
Solicitation), Section 9.3 (Assignments), Section 9.6 (Consent to
Jurisdiction), Section 9.7 (Waiver of Jury Trial), Section 9.8 (Specific
Performance), Section 9.14 (Cooperation) and Section 9.15
(Transaction Costs);   (d) any liability relating to, resulting from or
arising out of (i) any act or omission occurring prior to the Closing in
connection with the Companies\' Vision and Dental Businesses or (ii) any
Action by a Newco Employee against the Companies with respect to such Newco
Employee\'s employment prior to the Closing;   (e) any liability relating
to, resulting from or arising out of (x) the failure of NPA to qualify as a
foreign corporation in the State of Wisconsin or (y) a dispute between the
Shareholders and the Shareholders\' Agent in respect of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby;
or   (f) any and all liability for any Taxes of any of the Companies with
respect to any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing
Date (and for any Tax period beginning before and ending after the Closing
Date to the extent allocable (determined in a manner consistent with this
Section 8.1(f)) to the portion of such period beginning before and ending on
the Closing Date) to the extent such Taxes are not reflected in the
reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) shown
on the face of the Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement, provided,
however, that the Sellers shall not be responsible for any excess of a
Company\'s income Tax liability over the income Tax liability that would have
resulted in the absence of the Section 338(h)(10) Elections except to the
extent such excess liability arises from any provision of State or local
income Tax law corresponding to Section 1374 of the Code. The Sellers shall
pay or cause to be paid to ESI the portion of any Taxes of the Companies for
which they are liable pursuant to this Section 8.1(f) within fifteen (15)
days after the date on which such Taxes are paid. For purposes of this
Section 8.1(f), in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis
and are payable or credited for a taxable period that begins before the
Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax or Tax
credit which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the
Closing Date shall (x) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes    
57   based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax or Tax credit for the entire taxable period multiplied by
a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire taxable period, and (y) in the case of any Tax or Tax credit
based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount
which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended on the Closing
Date. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing
allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the
Companies.   The claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, costs,
expenses, penalties, fines, judgments and damages of ESI Indemnified Parties
described in this Section 8.1 as to which ESI Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnification are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
"ESI LOSSES."   Section 8.2 INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF ESI.   (a) From
and after the Closing Date, ESI will indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers
and the Shareholders\' Agent (collectively, the "SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES")
from, against and in respect of any and all claims, liabilities, obligations,
losses, costs, expenses, penalties, fines and judgments (at equity or at law)
and damages whenever arising or incurred (including, without limitation,
amounts paid in settlement, costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys\'
fees and expenses) by them and arising out of or relating to:   (i) any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation  or warranty made by ESI in this
Agreement or in any of the  Ancillary Documents to which it is a party;
or   (ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or  undertaking made by ESI
in this Agreement.  The claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, costs,
expenses, penalties, fines, judgments and damages of the Seller Indemnified
Parties described in this Section 8.2(a) as to which the Seller Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification are hereinafter collectively referred
to as "SELLER LOSSES" and, together with ESI Losses, the "LOSSES".   (b)
For a period of six years after the Closing Date, ESI shall cause the
Companies to refrain from making any amendments or modifications to, or
deleting, the provisions of their certificates of incorporation and by-laws
relating to the indemnification of (and the advancement of expenses
to) directors and officers, to the extent that such provisions relate to
the indemnification of Non-Shareholder Officers and Directors for events
occurring at or prior to the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, the
term "NON-SHAREHOLDER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS" shall mean the present and
former officers and directors of each of the Companies other than the
Shareholders.   (c) If ESI or the Companies or any of their successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation or
entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity,
then, and    58   in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of ESI and the Companies shall assume all of
the obligations set forth in Section 8.2(b).   (d) The provisions of
Sections 8.2(b) and (c) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Non-Shareholder Officers and Directors, their
heirs, their representatives and their assigns.   Section 8.3
INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE.   (a) Promptly after receipt by an ESI
Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (hereinafter collectively
referred to as an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") of notice by a Person of any
complaint, claim or demand or the commencement of any audit, investigation,
action or proceeding (collectively, a "CLAIM") with respect to which such
Indemnified Party may be entitled to receive payment from the other Party for
any ESI Losses or any Seller Losses (as the case may be), such Indemnified
Party will notify ESI or the Shareholders\' Agent, as the case may be (the
"INDEMNIFYING PARTY"), promptly following the Indemnified Party\'s receipt of
such Claim or of notice of the commencement of such audit, investigation,
action or proceeding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability under
this Agreement with respect to such Claim only if, and only to the extent
that, such failure to notify the Indemnifying Party results in the forfeiture
by the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Claim. The Indemnifying Party will
have the right, upon written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within
ten (10) days thereafter acknowledging full responsibility (subject to the
limitations set forth in Sections 8.4, 8.5 and 8.6) for any ESI Losses or
Seller Losses (as the case may be) resulting from such audit, investigation,
action or proceeding, to assume the defense of such Claim, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and
the payment of the fees and disbursements of such counsel. In the event,
however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or fails to assume the defense
of the Claim on the terms provided above or to employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, in either case within such
ten (10)-day period, then such Indemnified Party may employ counsel to
represent or defend it in any such Claim, and the Indemnifying Party will pay
the reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel as incurred; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that the Indemnifying Party will not be required to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one (1) counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
single jurisdiction with respect to any Claim. In any Claim for which the
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, the Indemnified Party will have
the right to participate in (but not to control) such defense and to retain
its own counsel at such Indemnified Party\'s own expense. The Indemnifying
Party will at all times use reasonable efforts to keep the Indemnified Party
reasonably apprised of the status of the defense of any matter the defense of
which the Indemnifying Party has assumed. The Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party will cooperate in good faith with respect to the defense
of any such matter.   (b) No Indemnified Party may admit any liability with
respect to, settle or compromise any Claim or consent to the entry of any
judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless (i) the
Indemnifying Party fails to assume and maintain the defense of such Claim
pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or    59   (ii) such settlement, compromise
or consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying Party and
its representatives from all liability arising out of such Claim. An
Indemnifying Party may not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
admit any liability with respect to, settle or compromise any claim or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is
being sought hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent (x)
includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party and its
representatives from all liability arising out of such Claim, (y) does not
contain any agreement, admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or
liability on behalf of the Indemnified Party and (z) does not contain any
agreement, equitable order, judgment or term which in any manner affects,
restrains or interferes with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of
the Indemnified Party\'s representatives.   (c) In the event an Indemnified
Party claims a right to payment pursuant to this Agreement that does not
involve a third party, such Indemnified Party will send written notice of
such claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party. Such notice will specify
the basis for such claim. The failure by the Indemnified Party so to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any
liability which it may have to such Indemnified Party, except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that it has been actually prejudiced
by such failure. As promptly as possible after the Indemnified Party has
given such notice, such Indemnified Party and the appropriate Indemnifying
Party will establish the merits and amount of such claim (by mutual
agreement, litigation or otherwise) and, within five (5) Business Days of the
final determination of the merits and amount of such claim, the Indemnifying
Party will (subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 8.4, 8.5 and
8.6) pay to the Indemnified Party immediately available funds in an amount
equal to such claim as determined hereunder.   (d) PROCEDURES RELATING TO
INDEMNIFICATION OF TAX CLAIMS. (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Section 8.3, if a claim is made by any taxing authority, which, if
successful, might result in an indemnity payment to ESI, the Companies, or
one of their Affiliates or any of their respective representatives pursuant
to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party receiving notice of such claim
shall promptly give notice to the Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim
(a "TAX CLAIM"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that failure to give such notice shall
not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure.   (ii) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to any Tax period 
beginning before and ending on or before the Closing Date, the 
Shareholders\' Agent shall contro all proceedings and may make all  decisions
taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including  selection of counsel)
and, without limiting the foregoing, may in its  sole discretion pursue or
forego any and all administrative appeals,  proceedings, hearings and
conferences with any Governmental Entity  serving as a Tax authority (a
"TAXING AUTHORITY") with respect thereto,  and may, in its sole discretion,
either pay the Tax claimed (with its  own funds) and sue for a refund where
applicable law permits such  refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any
permissible manner;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that to the extent that the
settlement of an issue  raised in such a proceeding could materially affect
the liability  for Taxes of ESI or the Companies for any period ending after
the  Closing Date, ESI and the Shareholders\' Agent shall have joint
control  over such proceeding, and the issue shall not be settled without
the  consent of ESI, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.   60   
(iii) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to any Tax period  beginning
before and ending after the Closing Date and with respect to  any Tax Claim
relating to a taxable period beginning after the Closing  Date, ESI shall
control all proceedings and may make all decisions  taken in connection with
such Tax Claim (including selection of  counsel) and, without limiting the
foregoing, may in its sole  discretion pursue or forego any and all
administrative appeals,  proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
Taxing Authority with  respect thereto, and may, in its sole discretion,
either pay the Tax  claimed (with its own funds) and sue for a refund where
applicable law  permits such refund suits or contest the Tax Claim in any
permissible  manner; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that to the extent that the
settlement of an  issue raised in such a proceeding could materially affect
the liability  for Taxes of any Seller (including, without limitation, any
liability  pursuant to this Agreement) for any Tax period beginning before
and  ending on or before the Closing Date, ESI shall not settle such issue 
without the consent of the applicable Seller, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld. ESI shall keep the Shareholders\' Agent informed  of
the progress of any such Tax Claim and proceeding.   (iv) ESI, each of the
Sellers and each of the Companies (as  applicable) and each of their
respective Affiliates shall reasonably  cooperate with each other in
contesting any Tax Claim, which  cooperation shall include the retention and,
upon the request of the  party or parties controlling proceedings relating to
such Tax Claim,  the provision to such party or parties of records and
information which  are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making
employees  available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional 
information or explanation of any material provided hereunder or to  testify
at proceedings relating to such Tax Claim.   Section 8.4 CLAIMS PERIOD. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "CLAIMS PERIOD" shall be the period during
which a claim for indemnification may be asserted under this Agreement by an
Indemnified Party. No claim for indemnification hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement may be made at any time after the last day of the Claims Period for
such claim. The Claims Periods under this Agreement shall begin on the
Closing Date and terminate as follows:   (a) with respect to ESI Losses
involving the assertion of a claim of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty in Section 2.2 or Section 2.3, (ii) any breach of
the Sellers\' covenants, agreements and undertakings set forth in Article I,
(iii) any breach of the Sellers\' covenants, agreements and undertakings set
forth in the following Sections of this Agreement to be performed on or after

Solicitation), Section 9.3 (Assignments), Section 9.6 (Consent to
Jurisdiction), Section 9.7 (Waiver of Jury Trial), Section 9.8 (Specific
Performance) or Section 9.14 (Cooperation), (iv) any liability relating to,

resulting from or arising out of a dispute between the Shareholders and the
Shareholders\' Agent in respect of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the Claims Period shall
continue indefinitely, provided, however, that with respect to a covenant
herein that, by its express terms, extends only for a limited period of time,
the Claims Period relating to a breach of such covenant shall expire at the
end of such period;   61    (b) with respect to ESI Losses involving the
assertion of a claim of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty in Section 2.6(b), Section 2.20, Section 2.21(d), Section 2.27 or
Section 2.28 or (ii) any breach of the Sellers\' covenants, agreements and
undertakings set forth in Section 4.2.10 (Brokerage Fees) or Section 9.15
(Transaction Costs) to be performed on or after the Closing, the Claims
Period shall end three (3) years after the Closing Date;   (c) with respect
to ESI Losses involving the assertion of a claim of (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in Section 2.15, (ii) any
liability relating to, resulting from or arising out of (x) any act or
omission occurring prior to the Closing in connection with the Companies\'
Vision and Dental Businesses or (y) any Action by a Newco Employee against
the Companies with respect to such Newco Employee\'s employment prior to the
Closing, (iii) any breach of the Sellers\' covenants, agreements
and undertakings set forth in Section 4.1.3 (Tax Matters), (iv) any breach of
the Sellers\' covenants, agreements and undertakings set forth in Section
4.1.5 (Section 1031 Exchange) to be performed on or after the Closing or (v)
any liability described in Section 8.1(f), the Claims Period shall end six
years after the Closing Date; and   (d) with respect to (A) ESI Losses
involving the assertion of a claim of (i) breach of any covenant, agreement
or undertaking made by the Sellers in this Agreement to be performed prior to
the Closing (other than pursuant to Section 4.1.3), (ii) breach of any
covenant, agreement or undertaking made by the Sellers in this Agreement to
be performed on or after the Closing, other than those covenants, agreements
and undertakings referred to in Sections 8.4(a), 8.4(b) and 8.4(c), or (iii)
breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty in Article II other
than those representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.2, 2.3,
2.6(b), 2.15, 2.20, 2.21(d), 2.27 or 2.28 and (B) Seller Losses relating to
or arising out of any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
in Article III, the Claims Period shall end eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of
business on the last day of the applicable Claims Period, an Indemnifying
Party shall have been properly notified by an Indemnified Party of a claim
for indemnity hereunder and such claim shall not have been finally resolved
or disposed of at such date, such claim shall continue to survive and shall
remain a basis for indemnity hereunder until such claim is finally resolved
or disposed of in accordance with the terms hereof and the terms of the
Escrow Agreement.   Section 8.5 LIABILITY LIMITS.   (a) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, ESI Indemnified Parties shall not
make a claim against the Sellers or the Shareholders\' Agent, and the Sellers
and the Shareholders\' Agent will not be liable for indemnification, under
this Agreement or otherwise, for ESI Losses unless and until the aggregate
amount of such ESI Losses (other than ESI Losses which are reimbursed
pursuant to the operation of Section 8.5(d)) exceeds one million dollars
($1,000,000) (the "ESI BASKET"), in which event ESI Indemnified   
62   Parties may claim indemnification for all ESI Losses in excess of the
initial $1,000,000 (subject to Section 8.5(b)); provided, however, that (X)
the ESI Basket shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with Section
8.5(d) and (Y) ESI Losses resulting from any of the following claims shall
not be subject to the ESI Basket:   (I) a Claim of (i) any breach or
inaccuracy of any  representation or warranty in Section 2.2 or Section 2.3,
(ii) any  breach of the Sellers\' covenants, agreements and undertakings set
forth  in Article I or Section 4.1.3 (Tax Matters), (iii) any breach of the

Sections of this Agreement to be performed on or after the  Closing: Section
4.1.1(f) (Names), Section 4.2.9 (Shareholder  Releases), Section 4.2.11
(Confidentiality), Section 4.2.12 (Sellers\'  Non-Solicitation), Section 9.3
(Assignments), Section 9.6 (Consent to  Jurisdiction), Section 9.7 (Waiver of
Jury Trial), Section 9.8  (Specific Performance) or Section 9.14
(Cooperation), (iv) any  liability relating to, resulting from or arising out
of the failure of  NPA to qualify as a foreign corporation in the State of
Wisconsin or  (v) any liability relating to, resulting from or arising out of
a  dispute between the Shareholders and the Shareholders\' Agent in respect 
of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents or the transactions  contemplated
hereby or thereby;   (II) a Claim of any breach of the Sellers\'
covenants,  agreements and undertakings set forth in Section 4.2.10
(Brokerage  Fees) or Section 9.15 (Transaction Costs) to be performed on or
after  the Closing; and   (III) a Claim of any liability relating to,
resulting  from or arising out of (i) any act or omission occurring prior to
the  Closing in connection with the Companies\' Vision and Dental
Businesses  or (ii) any Action by a Newco Employee against the Companies
with  respect to such Newco Employee\'s employment prior to the Closing.  
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, ESI
Indemnified Parties shall not make a claim against the Sellers or
the Shareholders\' Agent, and Sellers and the Shareholders\' Agent will not
be liable, for indemnification under this Agreement or otherwise, for ESI
Losses in excess of twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000) in the
aggregate (the "ESI Cap"); provided, however, that ESI Losses relating to any
of the following claims shall not be subject to the ESI Cap:   (I) a Claim
of (i) any breach or inaccuracy of any  representation or warranty in Section
2.2 or Section 2.3, (ii) any  breach of the Sellers\' covenants, agreements
and undertakings set forth  in Article I, (iii) any breach of the Sellers\'
covenants, agreements  and undertakings set forth in the following Sections
of this Agreement  to be performed on or after the Closing: Section 4.1.1(f)
(Names),  Section 4.2.9 (Shareholder Releases), Section 4.2.11
(Confidentiality),  Section 4.2.12 (Sellers\' Non-Solicitation), Section 9.3
(Assignments),  Section 9.6 (Consent to Jurisdiction), Section 9.7 (Waiver of
Jury  Trial), Section 9.8 (Specific Performance) or Section 9.14 
(Cooperation), (iv) any liability relating to, resulting from or  arising out
of the failure of NPA to qualify as a foreign corporation  in the State of
Wisconsin or (v) any liability relating to, resulting  from or arising out of
a dispute between the Shareholders and the  Shareholders\' Agent in respect
of this Agreement, the Ancillary  Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby;   63    (II) a Claim of any breach of the Sellers\'
covenants,  agreements and undertakings set forth in Section 4.2.10
(Brokerage  Fees) or Section 9.15 (Transaction Costs) to be performed on or
after  the Closing; and   (III) a Claim of any liability relating to,
resulting  from or arising out of (i) any act or omission occurring prior to
the  Closing in connection with the Companies\' Vision and Dental
Businesses  or (ii) any Action by a Newco Employee against the Companies
with  respect to such Newco Employee\'s employment prior to the Closing;  
(c) The amount of any damages indemnifiable pursuant to this Article shall be
reduced to reflect the value of any Tax benefit actually realized by the
Indemnified Party or its successors or assigns as a result of such damages;
provided, however, that the determination of whether a Tax benefit is
actually realized will be made by the Indemnified Party and will not
be subject to review by the Indemnifying Party in the absence of manifest
error; and provided, further, that upon the reasonable request of the
Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall prepare (or cause to be
prepared), at the Indemnifying Party\'s sole and reasonable expense, and
furnish (or cause to be furnished) a pro forma statement which shall contain,
in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnifying Party, all pertinent Tax and
other financial information sufficient to establish the value, if any, of the
Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party, with respect to the
damages indemnifiable pursuant to this Article. In no event shall the Sellers
be permitted to review any Tax Return of ESI or the Companies pursuant to the
operation of the immediately preceding sentence. ESI agrees that it will use
all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain insurance proceeds under
existing policies purchased by the Companies prior to the Closing Date and
the amount of indemnification payable under Article VIII to ESI and the
Companies shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds actually
received by ESI and the Companies (net of any expenses incurred in pursuing
such insurance claim), and if the indemnification payment has already been
made by the Indemnifying Party, then ESI and the Companies shall pay over the
insurance proceeds to the extent the insurance proceeds recovered do not
exceed the indemnification payment; provided, however, that ESI shall have no
obligation to maintain any such insurance policies; and provided, further,
that this Section 8.5(c) shall not relieve any Indemnifying Party of its
obligations in the event that no insurance proceeds are
actually received.   (d) At the Closing, ESI may deliver to the
Shareholders\' Agent a written statement (the "WARRANTY STATEMENT") setting
forth, in reasonable detail, any assertions that ESI may choose to make that
(x) the representations and warranties set forth in Article II were not, as
of the date hereof, true and correct in all respects if specifically
qualified by materiality or, if not so qualified, true and correct in all
material respects (an "INITIAL WARRANTY ASSERTION") or (y) the
representations and warranties set forth in Article II are not, as of the
date of Closing, true and correct in all respects if specifically qualified
by materiality or, if not so qualified, true and correct in all material
respects (an "INTERIM PERIOD WARRANTY ASSERTION"). If, subsequent to the
Closing, ESI makes an Indemnification Claim based on an Initial Warranty
Assertion set forth in the Warranty Statement, the ESI Basket with respect to
such Indemnification Claims shall be zero. If, subsequent to the Closing, ESI
makes an Indemnification Claim based on an Interim Period Warranty Assertion
set forth in the Warranty Statement, the ESI Basket with respect to such
Indemnification Claims shall be five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000).  
64    Section 8.6 ESCROW AS EXCLUSIVE REMEDY; LIMITATIONS.   (a) Except
for the Extended Claims (as hereinafter defined), (i) ESI\'s sole and
exclusive remedy after the Closing with respect to claims for indemnification
shall be to seek recourse against the Escrow Fund created pursuant to Section
1.4(c) and (ii) ESI shall assert no claims for indemnification against the
Sellers or the Shareholders\' Agent after the Closing other than by seeking
recourse against the Escrow Fund. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"EXTENDED CLAIMS" shall mean each of the following claims:   (I) a Claim of
(i) any breach or inaccuracy of any  representation or warranty in Section
2.2 or Section 2.3, (ii) any  breach of the Sellers\' covenants, agreements
and undertakings set forth  in Article I, (iii) any breach of the Sellers\'
covenants, agreements  and undertakings set forth in the following Sections
of this Agreement  to be performed on or after the Closing: Section 4.1.1(f)
