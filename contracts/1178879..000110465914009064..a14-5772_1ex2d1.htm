Certificate_.

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(i) The " _Merger Consideration_ " shall be an amount equal to the sum of (A)
the Closing Consideration plus (B) the Milestone Consideration. Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event shall the value of the
aggregate Merger Consideration payable by the Parent hereunder exceed
$130,000,000 (including any Milestone Payments that may be made, and
determined, with respect to portions of the Milestone Consideration payable in
securities, on the date such payments are made). Notwithstanding Subsections
2.1 and 2.2 of the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the provisions of
which the Company represents and warrants have been validly and irrevocably
waived pursuant to a written instrument duly executed by the requisite Company
Stockholders (the " _Stockholder Waiver_ "), the Merger Consideration shall be
allocated among the Company Stockholders as set forth in this _Section 2.6_.

 



 

(ii) _Closing Consideration_. The " _Closing Consideration_ " shall be an
amount payable in Parent Shares equal to $15,000,000.

 



 

(iii) _Milestone Consideration_. In addition to the Closing Consideration, the
Merger Consideration (but subject to the limitation on the aggregate Merger
Consideration set forth in _Section 2.6(a)(i)_ above), shall also consist of
the Milestone Payments, if any, payable as and in the manner set forth on
_Schedule 2.6(a)(iii)_, in accordance with the terms set forth on such
_Schedule 2.6(a)(iii)_ (the " _Milestone Consideration_ "), subject at all
times to any offset thereto in accordance with _Section 8.4(i)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(iv) _Parent Discretion_. The Parent will exercise Commercially Reasonable
Efforts and diligence to achieve the Milestone Events set forth on _Schedule
2.6(a)(iii)_, including prosecuting and maintaining the Patents listed on
_Schedule 3.14(a)_, undertaking the investigations and actions required to
achieve such Milestone Events and dedicating reasonable available resources to
such efforts; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement, following the Effective Time, the
Parent retains the right, in its reasonable discretion: (x) to generally
operate the Surviving Corporation and the businesses conducted thereby in any
manner that the Parent deems appropriate in its reasonable discretion; and (y)
to reorganize or restructure the business, financial and/or legal structure of
the Surviving Corporation in any manner, at any time and from time to time,
whether by creation, dissolution or combination of divisions, transfer of
assets, merger, consolidation, transfer or issuance of securities or otherwise
or to cease, or dispose of, operations of the Surviving Corporation, in each
case regardless of any effect such actions may or may not have upon the
Milestone Payments, if it determines in its good faith and reasonable business
judgment that it is in the Parents and/or the Surviving Corporations
interest to do so; _provided further_ , that the Parent shall not enter into
any agreement for the transfer of any Company Technology or Product 1, Product
2 or Product 3, whether through merger, a sale of assets, licensing or
otherwise, unless the transferee thereof agrees to assume the Milestone
Payment obligations in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. The Company and each of the Primary Company
Stockholders hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that (A) the payment of
the Milestone Consideration hereunder is expressly dependent upon the
performance of the Surviving Corporation, and not upon the performance of the
Parent or any business conducted thereby other than through the Surviving
Corporation, (B) there is no requirement, guaranty or other assurance of any
kind that any Milestone Consideration will be payable hereunder (regardless of
any projections, models, forecasts or any other financial data generated by,
or provided to, the Company, any Company Stockholder, or the Parent) and (C)
the right to receive any Milestone Consideration shall be governed solely and
exclusively by the express provisions of this _Section 2.6(a)_ and _Schedule
2.6(a)(iii)_, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in
any other Contract, written or oral, between the Parent, the Company, the
Company Stockholders or any of their Affiliates.

 



 

(b) _Effect on Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Company Stockholders:

 



 

(i) each share of Company Capital Stock held in the treasury of the Company at
the Effective Time, if any, shall be cancelled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof, and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect
thereto;

 



 

(ii) each share of Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be
cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)(i)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be
cancelled, extinguished and converted into the right to receive an amount
payable as set forth herein, without interest, equal to the Per Share Series A
Merger Consideration, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the indemnification provisions set forth in _ARTICLE
VIII_; and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled
pursuant to _Section 2.6(b)(i)_ and any Dissenting Shares) shall be

") signed by the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Company Stockholders)
and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company certifying as to the accuracy
and completeness, in each case as of the Closing, of:

 



 

(i) an estimated unaudited balance sheet (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") of
the Company as of 11:59 PM Eastern time on the Closing Date substantially in
the form of the Company Balance Sheet and prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except for the absence of footnotes) on a basis consistent with and utilizing
the same principles, practices and policies as those used in preparing the
Company Balance Sheet;

 



 

(ii) a statement of the aggregate Acquisition Expenses to be paid out of the
Cash Reserve together with a statement certifying that all other Acquisition
Expenses have been paid-in-full and that the services of each third party that
provided any services to the Company or, to the Companys Knowledge, the
Company Stockholders related to the Transactions have been terminated
effective as of the Closing Date (provided that, with respect to any such
Acquisition Expenses, the Company shall provide to the Parent, as reasonably
requested, paid-in-full receipts (or other documentation reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent) from any such third party service provider
evidencing that such Acquisition Expenses have been paid-in-full and/or
services terminated);

 



 

(iii) the aggregate Cash as of the Closing, which shall equal no less than
$300,000 (the " _Cash Reserve_ "), and which shall be subject to the

(iv) the calculation of the Closing Consideration, the number of Fully Diluted
Common Shares, the Per Share Common Closing Consideration with respect to each
outstanding share of Company Common Stock, the Per Share Series A Closing
Consideration with respect to each outstanding share of Series A Preferred
Stock, the Series A Liquidation Preference with respect to each outstanding

certificate numbers held by each such Company Stockholder;

 



 

(vi) the amount of: (A) the Closing Consideration payable to each Company
Stockholder; and (B) required withholding (if any) with respect to each
Company Stockholder; and

 



      
 

 



 

(vii) the Pro Rata Share of each Company Stockholder and Primary Company
Stockholder.

 



 

The Company shall have given the Parent timely access to all supporting work-
papers used in the preparation of the Allocation Certificate and the
underlying documents. The calculation of the Merger Consideration as set forth
in the Allocation Certificate, when in form and substance satisfactory to and
approved by the Parent (which approval shall in no way limit the
indemnification obligations of the Primary Company Stockholders pursuant to
_Section 8.2(d)_), shall be deemed the definitive calculation of the Merger
Consideration payable to the Company Stockholders in connection with the
Merger and the disbursement thereof.

 



 

(d) _Withholding Rights; Deductions from Merger Consideration_. Each of the
Surviving Corporation and the Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any payment to any Person under this Agreement or any Related Agreements
(i) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment or any other Tax withholding obligation with respect to
the Transactions or the exercise, cancellation or cash out of any Company
Option or Company Warrants or the vesting of restricted stock under the Code
or any provision of applicable Tax Law and (ii) the amount of any outstanding
loans (including any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and any other amounts
in respect thereof) owed by such Person to the Company as of the Closing. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted pursuant to clause (i) of
this _Section 2.6(d)_ by the Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, or the
Parent, as the case may be. The Surviving Corporation or the Parent, as the
case may be, shall pay over to the appropriate Governmental Body amounts
withheld under clause (i) of this _Section 2.6(d)_.

 



 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The amounts, if
any, paid or payable upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE
II_.

 



 

(f) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Company Stockholders, each share of common stock of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares shall
continue after the Effective Time to evidence ownership of such shares of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

2.7 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Capital Stock held by a Company Stockholder who demands and
perfects appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the DGCL and who,
as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal
rights (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.6_, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to
such rights as are granted by the DGCL.

 



 

(b) If any Company Stockholder who holds Dissenting Shares as of the Effective
Time effectively withdraws or loses (through passage of time, failure to
demand or perfect, or otherwise) the right to demand and perfect appraisal
rights under the DGCL, then, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
occurrence of such event, such holders shares that were Dissenting Shares
shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive
a portion of the Merger Consideration pursuant to and subject to _Section
2.6_ (subject to the indemnification provisions set forth in _ARTICLE VIII_)
without interest thereon upon surrender of the certificate representing such
shares.

 



 

(c) The Company and/or the Holder Representative, on the one hand, and the
Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, on the other hand, shall give the
other party (i) prompt written notice of any demands for appraisal of any
shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the exercise of appraisal rights,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments or notices served
pursuant to the DGCL on the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
respectively, and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Neither the
Surviving Corporation nor the Parent, on the one hand, shall, except with the
prior written consent of the Holder Representative, and neither the Company
nor the Holder Representative, on the other hand, shall, except with the prior
written consent of the Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment
with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Capital Stock, or settle
or offer to settle any such demands.

 



 

2.8 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. The Parent shall act as payment agent in the Merger.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. The Company has distributed, or the Holder
Representative will distribute promptly after the execution of this Agreement
(but not later than two (2) Business Days after the Closing Date), to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ")
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock a letter of transmittal substantially in the form and
substance of _Exhibit D_ hereto (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). Following
the Effective Time and delivery to the Parent of a duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal, together with surrender of a Certificate (or
Certificates) for cancellation, each Stockholder shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such
Stockholder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.6_ (subject to the conditions
to payment of the Milestone Consideration set forth on _Schedule
2.6(a)(iii)_) and the Certificate(s) so surrendered

 



      
 

 



 

shall be cancelled. Following the Effective Time, until so surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares
of Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for
all corporate purposes, to evidence only the right to receive a portion of the
Merger Consideration as provided in this _ARTICLE II_.

 



 

(c) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
2.8_, none of the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall
be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official in
compliance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Parent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration
required pursuant to _Section 2.6_ at the times set forth in _ARTICLE II_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as the Parent
may direct as indemnity or to otherwise agree to provide an indemnity
reasonably acceptable to the Parent against any claim that may be made against
the Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

2.9 _Payoff of Acquisition Expenses_. On or before the Closing Date but prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall have fully paid and satisfied all
Acquisition Expenses that are or may become due and payable in connection with
the Closing, as set forth on the statement of Acquisition Expenses, other than
Acquisition Expenses to be paid out of the Cash Reserve as noted on the
statement of Acquisition Expenses. To the extent any Acquisition Expenses
remain unpaid or become due and payable after the Effective Time, other than
Acquisition Expenses to be paid out of the Cash Reserve as noted on the
statement of Acquisition Expenses, the Holder Representative shall fully pay
and satisfy, or cause to be fully paid and satisfied, all such amounts when
due and neither the Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any
liability or obligation with respect thereto.

 



 

2.10 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Parent, the Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized in
the name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take,
all such lawful and necessary action.

 



 

2.11 _Limitation on Issuance of Parent Shares_. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement or any Related Agreement, the Parent shall not,
without the prior approval of its stockholders as required pursuant to the
rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Global Market, be permitted to pay Merger
Consideration in Parent Common Stock under this Agreement: (i) if the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued hereunder would
exceed 19.99% of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock as of the
Agreement Date (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the rules of The
NASDAQ Global Market); or (ii) to any Company Stockholder that, together with
such Company Stockholders Affiliates and any other

 



      
 

 



 

persons acting as a group together with such Company Stockholder and any of
such Company Stockholders Affiliates, (x) immediately prior to the applicable
payment date, does not beneficially own more than 19.99% of the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the
rules of The NASDAQ Global Market), if as a result of such issuance of Parent
Common Stock, such Company Stockholder (together with such Company
Stockholders Affiliates and any other persons acting as a group together with
such Company Stockholders and any of such Company Stockholders Affiliates)
would beneficially own more than 19.99% of the outstanding shares of Parent
Common Stock (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the rules of The
NASDAQ Global Market) immediately after giving effect to the issuance of such
Parent Common Stock: or (y) immediately prior to the applicable payment date,
as applicable, beneficially owns more than 19.99% of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the rules of The
NASDAQ Global Market), if such Company Stockholder (together with such Company
Stockholders Affiliates and any other persons acting as a group together with
such Company Stockholder and any of such Company Stockholders Affiliates) is
not the largest beneficial owner of the Common Stock (as such ownership is
calculated pursuant to the rules of The NASDAQ Global Market) immediately
prior to the applicable payment date, but, as a result of such issuance of
Parent Common Stock to such Company Stockholder, such Company Stockholder
(together with such Company Stockholders Affiliates and any other persons
acting as a group together with such Company Stockholders and any of such
Company Stockholders Affiliates) would (X) become the largest beneficial
owner of the Parent Common Stock (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to
the rules of The NASDAQ Global Market) immediately after giving effect to the
issuance of such Parent Common Stock or (Y) become the beneficial owner of a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (as such ownership is calculated
pursuant to the rules of The NASDAQ Global Market) immediately after giving
effect to the issuance of such Parent Common Stock which, had such Parent
Common Stock been received by such Company Stockholder as of the date such
Company Stockholder entered into this Agreement, would have caused such
Company Stockholder to become the largest beneficial owner of Parent Common
Stock (as such ownership is calculated pursuant to the rules of The NASDAQ
Global Market) as of such earlier date. Immediately following the date (if
ever) that the Parent obtains the requisite stockholder approval required
pursuant to the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Global Market, the
restrictions in this _Section 2.11_ shall terminate and be of no further
force or effect. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Holder Representative, to
the extent that any Merger Consideration otherwise payable in Parent Common
Stock would exceed the limitations set forth in this _Section 2.11_ as of the
time such Merger Consideration is due and payable, the portion of such Merger
Consideration shall be paid by the Parent in cash in lieu of Parent Common
Stock. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall the
number shares of Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder exceed at any time in
the aggregate 49.99% of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock as of
the date hereof.

 



 

2.12 _Holder Representative_.

 



 

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders, each Company Stockholder

substitution to act jointly on behalf of such Company Stockholder in any
litigation or arbitration involving this Agreement or any Related Agreement,
and jointly to do or refrain from doing all such other acts and things, and
jointly to execute all such documents, as the Holder Representative shall deem
necessary, appropriate or desirable in connection with any of the
Transactions, including without limitation the power:

 



 

(i) To receive, hold and deliver to the Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, the certificates and any other documents evidencing the Company Shares
and/or any other documents relating thereto or to the Transactions on behalf
of such Company Stockholder;

 



 

(ii) To execute and deliver all ancillary agreements, certificates,
statements, notices, approvals, extensions, waivers, undertakings, amendments
and other documents required or permitted to be given in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions;

 



 

(iii) To receive funds, direct payment of funds (in accordance with the
Allocation Certificate) and give receipts for funds, including in respect of
receipt of any portion of the Merger Consideration, including, without
limitation funds disbursed in connection with the receipt of any Milestone

(iv) To execute and deliver, should it elect to do so in its good faith
discretion, on behalf of the Company Stockholders, any amendment to, or waiver
of, any term or provision of this Agreement or any Related Agreement or any
consent, acknowledgment or release relating to this Agreement or any Related
Agreement;

Indemnified Party and any such Company Stockholder, in each case relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions, and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the sole judgment of the Holder Representative for the
accomplishment of any of the foregoing;

 



 

(vi) To give and receive all notices and communications to be given or
received under this Agreement and to receive service of process in connection

Representative deems necessary, appropriate or desirable in its good faith
discretion relating to the subject matter hereof or of any Related Agreement
(as fully and completely as such Company Stockholder could do if personally
present).

 



 

(b) _Reliance on Appointment; Successor Holder Representative_. The death or
incapacity of any Company Stockholder shall not terminate the agency and power
of attorney granted hereby to the Holder Representative. The appointment of
the Company Stockholder shall be deemed coupled with an interest, and the
Parent, the Company and any other person may conclusively and absolutely rely,
without inquiry, upon any action or omission of the Holder Representative as
the action of the Company Stockholders in all matters referred to herein or in
any Related Agreement until receipt of written notice of the appointment of a
successor Holder Representative made in accordance with this _Section
2.12(b)_. All actions, decisions, instructions and other actions and omissions
of the Holder Representative shall be final, conclusive and binding upon all
Company Stockholders and no Company Stockholder shall have any cause of action
against the Parent or the Company for any action taken or not taken or
omission by the Holder Representative in its role as such. At any time after
the Closing, with or without cause, by a written instrument that is signed in
writing by a majority-in-interest of the Company Stockholders, other than the
then current Holder Representative if a Company Stockholder (determined by
reference to their respective Pro Rata Shares) and delivered to the Parent,
the Company Stockholders may remove and designate a successor Holder
Representative reasonably acceptable to the Parent. If the Holder
Representative shall at any time resign or otherwise cease to function in its
capacity as such for any reason whatsoever, and no replacement is appointed by
a majority-in-interest of the Company Stockholders within ten (10) Business
Days, then the Parent shall have the right to appoint another Company
Stockholder to act as the replacement Holder Representative who shall serve as
described in this Agreement and, under such circumstances, the Parent and the
other Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to rely on any and all
actions taken and decisions made by such replacement Holder Representative.

 



 

(c) _Fees and Expenses_. All out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses (including
fees payable to counsel, accountants and other professionals) incurred by the
Holder Representative in connection with performing such function and in
connection with the Transactions, and all payments, damages, costs, fees and
expenses in connection with any dispute with the Parent or the Company under
this Agreement or any other Related Agreement, shall be paid by the Primary
Company Stockholders in proportion to their Pro Rata Percentages (and may be
deducted by the Holder Representative from any amounts otherwise payable in
cash hereunder). For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Parent nor the
Company shall have any responsibility whatsoever for any such amount.

 



 

(d) _Disbursements_. Any amounts received by the Holder Representative
pursuant to this Agreement (other than any amount(s) to which the Holder
Representative may be entitled to retain in its his capacity as the Holder
Representative) shall be promptly disbursed by the Holder Representative to
the Company Stockholders entitled to receive a portion of such amount in
accordance with this Agreement, subject to reduction on account of the payment
of fees and expenses of the Holder Representative as provided in _Section
2.12(c)_.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) _Liability_. The Holder Representative shall not be held liable by any of
the Company Stockholders for actions or omissions in exercising or failing to
exercise all or any of the power and authority of the Holder Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, except in the case of the Holder Representatives
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Holder Representative
shall be entitled to rely on the advice of counsel, public accountants or
other independent experts that it reasonably determines to be experienced in
the matter at issue, and will not be liable to any Company Stockholder for any
action taken or omitted to be taken in good faith based on such advice. The
Company Stockholders will, severally and not jointly, indemnify (in accordance
with their Pro Rata Percentages) the Holder Representative from any Losses
arising out of its serving as the Holder Representative hereunder, except for
Losses arising out of or caused by the Holder Representatives gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Holder Representative is
serving in its his capacity as such solely for purposes of administrative
convenience, and is not personally liable in such capacity for any of the
obligations of the Company Stockholders hereunder, and the Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company agree that they will not look to the assets of the Holder
Representative, acting in such capacity, for the satisfaction of any
obligations to be performed by the Company Stockholders hereunder except to
the extent of the Holder Representatives gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct.

 



 

(f) _Acceptance_. Cuong Do hereby accepts his appointment as the Holder
Representative.

Subject to such exceptions as are specifically set forth in the appropriate
section, subsection or subclause of the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to the Parent herewith (the " _Disclosure Schedule_ ") or in any other

The Company has not conducted any business under or otherwise used for any
purpose in any jurisdiction any fictitious name, assumed name, "d/b/a", trade

would otherwise be required to pay pursuant to the terms of such Disclosable
Contract had the Transactions not occurred) after the Effective Time so as to
preserve all rights of, and benefits to, the Company, as the case may be,
under such Disclosable Contract from and after the Effective Time.

3.6 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 5,000,000
shares of Company Common Stock, of which 842,967 shares are issued and
outstanding as of the Agreement Date, and (ii) 650,000 shares of Series A
Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the " _Series A Preferred
Stock_"), of which 627,574 shares are issued and outstanding as of the
Agreement Date. The Company does not have any other shares of preferred stock
or any other shares of capital stock or any other equity or ownership
interests of any kind authorized, designated, issued or outstanding. The
Company Capital Stock, including all shares subject to the Companys right of
repurchase, is held of record and, to the Companys Knowledge, beneficially by
the Persons with the addresses and in the amounts and represented by the
certificates set forth on _Schedule 3.6(a)_. All outstanding shares of
Company Capital Stock (i) have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, non-assessable and not subject to preemptive rights or similar
rights created by statute, the Companys Organizational Documents or any
Contract to which the Company is a party (other than the Investor Agreements),
and (ii) have been offered, sold, issued and delivered by the Company in all
material respects in compliance with the terms of any applicable Contract to
which the Company

 



      
 

 



 

is a party, the Organizational Documents of the Company and all applicable
Laws. No dividends or other Distributions with respect to any shares of
Company Capital Stock have ever been made or declared, and except for the
"Accruing Dividends" (as defined in the Company Certificate of Incorporation)
none have accrued. All preferential rights of the Series A Preferred Stock in
connection with the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company, a
merger or any other change in control transaction (including a deemed
liquidation or dissolution) involving the Company are set forth in the Company
Certificate of Incorporation and the Investor Agreements. Each share of Series
A Preferred Stock is convertible into one share of Company Common Stock. The
Company holds no Company Common Stock in its treasury.

 



 

(b) Except for the Company Option Plan, the Company has never adopted,
sponsored or maintained any stock option plan or any other plan or Contract
providing for equity or equity-based compensation to any Person. The Company
Option Plan has been duly authorized, approved and adopted by the Company
Board and the Companys stockholders and is in full force and effect. The
Company has reserved for issuance 340,000 shares of Company Common Stock under
the Company Option Plan, of which options to purchase 39,145 shares of Company
Common Stock have been previously granted and validly exercised in accordance
with their respective terms (each, a " _Company Option_ " and collectively,
the " _Company Options_ "). _Schedule 3.6(b)_ sets forth for each Company
Option, the name of the holder of such option, an indication of whether such
holder is an employee, director or consultant of the Company, the date of
grant or issuance and date of exercise of such option, the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such option, and the exercise price of such
option. Each Company Option had an exercise price that equaled or exceeded the
fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock as of the date of grant
of such Company Option (and as of any later modification thereof). With
respect to each Company Option, (i) the grant of such Company Option was duly
authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such Company Option
was by its terms to be effective by all necessary action, including, as
applicable, approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted and
authorized committee thereof), and any required stockholder approval by the
necessary number of votes or written consents, (ii) the award agreement
governing such grant (if any) was duly executed and delivered by each party
thereto, and (iii) each such grant was made in accordance with the terms of
the applicable Company Option Plan and in all material respects with all
applicable Laws.

 



 

(c) Expect as set forth in the Investor Agreements, there are no outstanding
Security Rights for or related to any Company Security, whether or not
currently exercisable, and the Company does not have nor is bound by any (A)
promise or commitment to issue, deliver, sell, repurchase or redeem, or cause
to be issued, delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any Company Security,
or (B) obligation to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, change the
price of, otherwise amend or enter into any Security Right for or related to
any Company Security. There are no outstanding or authorized stock
appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation, or other similar rights
with respect to the Company. Except for the warrants to purchase Series A
Preferred Stock listed and described in detail (which description shall
include the name of the holder of such warrant, the date of issuance and the
date of exercise of such warrant, the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such warrant and the exercise price of such warrant) on Schedule
3.6(c) (the " _Company Warrants_ "), the Company has not previously issued any
warrants to purchase any Company Security. As of the Agreement Date, all
Company Warrants have been validly exercised in full in accordance with their
terms.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Except for the Investor Agreements, there are no (i) voting trusts,
proxies or other Contracts or understandings with respect to any Company
Securities to which the Company is a party, by which the Company is bound, or
which exist to the Companys Knowledge, or (ii) Contracts or understandings to
which the Company is a party, by which the Company is bound, or which exist to
the Companys Knowledge relating to the voting, registration, sale or transfer
(including Contracts relating to rights of first refusal, "co-sale" rights or
"drag-along" rights) of any Company Securities. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the Related Agreements and the consummation
of the Transactions by the Company does not breach or violate any rights or
obligations under the Investor Agreements that have not been complied with or
waived. The holders of shares of Company Capital Stock and any other Company
Security and any Security Right with respect to any of the foregoing have been
or will be properly given or shall have properly waived any required notice
prior to the Merger.

reliability of the Company Financial Statements and (ii) in a timely manner
accumulate and communicate to the Companys principal executive officer and
principal financial officer the type of information that is required to be
disclosed in the Company Financial Statements. Neither the Company nor, to the

complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding
the inadequacy of such systems and processes or the accuracy or integrity of

any of the Companys assets, other than Liens for ad valorem Taxes not yet due
and payable. _Schedule 3.11_ lists all jurisdictions (whether foreign or
domestic) to which any Tax is properly payable by the Company. No claim has
ever been made by a Tax Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company does not

any such claim.

non-U.S. tax audits or administrative or judicial Tax proceedings pending or
being conducted with respect to the Company. The Company has not received from

(including the Company Option Plan, any Company Employee Plan or the Company
Options) that, and no amount paid or payable to any current or former

an applicable Tax treaty) or otherwise have an office or fixed place of
business in a country other than the country in which it is organized.

 



 

(h) The Company is not a party to any Tax sharing agreement or similar
arrangement (including an indemnification agreement or arrangement). The
Company has never been a member of a group filing a consolidated federal
income Tax Return or a combined, consolidated, unitary or other affiliated
group Tax Return for state, local or foreign Tax purposes (other than a group
the common parent of which is the Company), and the Company has no liability

corresponding provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law), or as a
transferee or successor, or by contract, or otherwise.

exceed the reserve for actual Taxes (without regard to any reserve for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) which has been separately disclosed on the Company Balance Sheet, and

time through the Closing Date as measured in accordance with the reasonable

the Code.

disclosure that it applies to such other section, subsection or subclause of
this _ARTICLE IV_ without reference to the documents referenced therein, the
Parent and Merger Sub jointly and severally hereby represent and warrant to
the Company as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Organization of Parent and Merger Sub; Operation of Merger Sub_. Each of
the Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Each of the
Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business and is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the
ownership, leasing, holding or use of its properties makes such qualification
necessary, except such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or
licensed or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Merger Sub is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of
the Parent, was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the Transactions,
has engaged in no other business activities and has conducted its operations
only as contemplated by this Agreement or in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

4.2 _Authority_. Each of the Parent and Merger Sub has and will have as of the
Closing all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and the Related Agreements to which it is a party, to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements to which the Parent or Merger Sub is a party and the consummation
of the Transactions by the Parent and Merger Sub have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Parent and Merger Sub. No
vote of the stockholders of the Parent is required by any applicable Law,
including the rules and regulations of The NASDAQ Global Market, the
Organizational Documents of Parent or otherwise in order for the Parent to
issue the Parent Shares in connection with the delivery of the Closing
Consideration or for the Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions
(other than any vote of the stockholders that may be required under the rules
and regulations of The NASDAQ Global Market in connection with the issuance of
Parent Shares as Milestone Consideration). This Agreement has been, and each
of the Related Agreements to which the Parent or Merger Sub is a party will be
at the Closing, duly executed and delivered by the Parent and Merger Sub and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other parties
hereto and thereto (other than the Parent and Merger Sub), this Agreement
constitutes, and in the case of the Related Agreements they will at Closing
constitute, valid, legal and binding obligations of the Parent and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each of the Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with their
respective terms, except as such enforceability may be subject to applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights generally and by general principles of
equity; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Certificate of Merger will not be
effective until filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

 



      
 

 



 

4.3 _Consents_. No consent, waiver, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Body,
is required by or with respect to the Parent or Merger Sub in connection with
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements by the Parent and Merger Sub or the consummation by the Parent and
Merger Sub of the Transactions, except for (a) the filing of the Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, (b) such
consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations, declarations,
filings and notices as may be required under applicable securities Laws, and
(c) such other filings, authorizations, consents and approvals that if not
obtained or made would not reasonably be expected to have a material and
adverse effect on the ability of the Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the
Transactions.

 



 

4.4 _No Conflict_. The execution, delivery and performance by the Parent and
Merger Sub of this Agreement and the Related Agreements to which either is a
party, and the consummation of the Transactions, do not and will not conflict
with or result in any violation of or default under (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation,
modification or acceleration of any obligation or loss of any benefit under
(a) any provision of the Organizational Documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (b)
any material Contract to which the Parent or Merger Sub is a party or to which
they or any of their respective properties or assets (whether tangible or
intangible) is subject or bound, or (c) any Law applicable to the Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective properties (whether tangible or
intangible) or assets, except, in the case of clause (c), for such conflicts,
violations or defaults as would not individually or in the aggregate
reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the operations
and business of the Parent or Merger Sub as currently conducted or the ability
of the Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Transactions in a timely manner.

 



 

4.5 _Capitalization of the Parent and Merger Sub_. As of September 30, 2013,

make any such disclosure prior to the Parent issuing a press release publicly
announcing this Agreement; and further

the Closing. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, in the event
that either the Parent or the Company (or any Affiliate thereof) is required
by Law or any listing or trading agreement to make any such disclosure, such
party shall notify the other prior to making such disclosure and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to give the other an opportunity (as is

make (and will cooperate with the other parties in obtaining or making) any
consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any registration,

other third Person, required to be obtained or made by such party or its
Affiliates in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action
contemplated thereby or by this Agreement or any Related Agreement; and (d) at
the request of another party hereto, execute and deliver such other
instruments and do and perform such other acts and things as may be reasonably
necessary or desirable for effecting completely the consummation of the Merger
and the other Transactions.

 



 

5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. From the Agreement Date until the
Effective Time, the Company shall give prompt written notice to the Parent of:
(a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that is likely to cause any
of its representations or warranties contained in this Agreement to be untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time; (b)
any failure to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any of the
covenants, conditions or agreements to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; and (c) any event, condition, fact or circumstance that would

VI_ required to be satisfied by it incapable of being satisfied in a timely
manner; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 5.6_ shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available
to Parent, Merger Sub or any Parent Indemnified Party.

 



 

5.7 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, neither the Company nor any of its
managers, members, officers, directors, employees, Primary Company
Stockholders, Affiliates, financial advisors or

 



      
 

 



 

representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ") shall, directly or
indirectly, take any of the following actions with any Person other than the
Parent and its designees: (i) solicit, initiate, entertain or agree to any
proposals or offers from any Person relating to (A) any merger, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, consolidation or similar
transaction involving the Company, (B) the acquisition of beneficial ownership
of any equity or ownership interest in the Company, whether by issuance by the

discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with, facilitate or
encourage any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek, a Third Party
Acquisition.

 



 

(b) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the date of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, if the Company or any
Representative receives an inquiry, proposal or offer relating to a Third
Party Acquisition from any Person, each of the Company and such party shall
(i) promptly notify the Parent of the same and the details thereof (including
the identity of the Person making same) and the Company shall be permitted to
provide a response without breaching this _Section 5.7_; provided that the
response is limited to informing the initiator of such inquiry, proposal or
offer that the Company is unable to respond further at this time, (ii) provide
to the Parent a copy of any written inquiry, proposal or offer and all
correspondence related thereto, and (iii) keep the Parent informed of the
status thereof.

 



 

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that the provisions of this _Section 5.7_ were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
by the parties that the Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or
injunctions, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages
as a remedy and without the necessity of posting any bond or other security,
to prevent breaches of the provisions of this _Section 5.7_ and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States
or any state or any other jurisdiction having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which the Parent may be entitled at law or in
equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of
the restrictions set forth above by the Company or by any of its
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the
Company.

 



 

5.8 _Termination or Amendment of Certain Agreements; Notifications_. The
Company shall take all such steps as may be necessary to (i) terminate, as of

granted by the Company to any Company Stockholder and in effect prior to the
Closing, including rights of co-sale, voting, registration, first refusal,
board observation or information or operational covenants and (ii) deliver all
required notifications of the Merger and the other Transactions to the holders
of Company Securities and Security Rights with respect thereto. Each of the
Company Stockholders that is a party to an Investor Agreement hereby
irrevocably terminates such Investor Agreement and hereby waives any rights or

respect thereto, in each case effective immediately prior to, but conditioned
upon, the Closing.

 



       
 

 



 

5.9 _Certain Employment Matters_. Nothing contained herein shall obligate the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to (i) hire or retain any Employee,
independent contractor or consultant, (ii) provide any Employee, independent
contractor or consultant with any particular benefits, or (iii) make any
payments or provide any benefits to those Employees, independent contractors

(a) _Certain Taxes_. The cost of all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be equally shared

and each party will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees.

 



 

(b) _Tax Returns_. The Company will promptly provide or make available to the
Parent copies of all Tax Returns that are to be filed by the Company after the
Agreement Date and prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall permit the
Parent to review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to filing it,
providing the Parent with a reasonable time for such review and comment, and
shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by
the Parent. With respect to any Tax Returns not filed on or before the Closing
Date relating to the Company, for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle
Period, the Parent shall prepare and file such Tax Returns on behalf of the
Company. Parent shall deliver a copy of each such Tax Return to the Holder
Representative at least thirty (30) days prior to the filing of each such Tax
Return, and the Holder Representative shall have the right to review and
comment on such Tax Return for a period of twenty (20) days after receipt
thereof, and the Parent shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
reasonably requested by the Holder Representative. The Parent shall not amend
or cause to be amended any Tax Return of the Company relating to a Pre-Closing
Period or Straddle Period or otherwise take any action that affects the
Companys liability for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period or Straddle Period
without the prior written consent of the Holder Representative.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. The Company (and after the Closing, the
Holder Representative) shall cooperate fully as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the Parent, in connection with the preparation and filing of any
Tax Return, any enquiry, investigation, claim assessment, audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and, upon the Parents reasonable request, the provision of records
and information that are reasonably relevant to any such enquiry,
investigation, claim assessment, audit, litigation or other proceeding and
access to Employees on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Parent and
the Company (and after the Closing, the Holder Representative) (to the extent
applicable) agree to (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax
matters pertinent to the Company relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Body and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to give the other party
reasonable written notice prior to destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, the Parent and the

 



      
 

 



 

Holder Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records.

 



 

(d) _Tax Certificates_. The Parent and the Company (and after the Closing, the
Holder Representative) agree, upon request, to use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Body
or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including but not limited to with respect to the
Transactions).

 



 

(e) _Tax Contests_. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, following the
Closing, the Parent will have the sole right (but not the obligation) to
conduct any Tax enquiry, investigation, audit or other Tax dispute or contest
relating to the Company, subject to _Section 8.5_ (including without
limitation the right of the Holder Representative to assume and control the
defense of any proceeding that is subject to a claim for indemnification by a
Parent Indemnified Party in accordance with _Section 8.5_).

 



 

5.11 _Indemnification of Company Board and Officers; Insurance_.

members of the Company Board and present and former officers of the Company
(the " _Indemnified D andOs_") pursuant to the terms of the Companys
Organizational Documents as in effect on the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) _Insurance_. Promptly (but in any event not later than thirty (30)
calendar days) following the Effective Time, the Holder Representative shall
purchase an extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing
directors and officers liability insurance coverage in a form acceptable to
the Parent and that shall provide the members of the Company Board and the
Companys officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective
Time of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not
materially less favorable to the insured persons than the Companys directors
and officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the
Company.

 



 

5.12 _Resignation of Officers, Directors and SAB Members_. The Company shall
obtain the resignations of all members of the Company Board, all officers of
the Company and all members of the SAB effective as of the Effective Time.

 



 

5.13 _Company Stockholder Approval_.

 



 

(a) Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall
submit this Agreement and the Transactions (including the Merger) to the
Company Stockholders for approval and adoption as provided by the DGCL and the
Companys Organizational Documents. Such submission, and any proxy or consent
in connection therewith, shall specify that adoption of this Agreement shall
constitute approval by the Company Stockholders of: (i) the indemnification
obligations of the Primary Company Stockholders set forth in _ARTICLE VIII_
(including, without limitation, any rights of offset of the Parent under
_Section 8.4(i)_) hereof and (ii) the appointment of Cuong Do as the Holder
Representative, with the rights and responsibilities set forth in this
Agreement. The Company shall use its

 



      
 

 



 

commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approvals
as promptly as practicable following the execution of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Any materials to be submitted to the Company Stockholders in connection
with the solicitation of their approval of the Transactions and this Agreement
(the " _Soliciting Materials_ ") shall have been, and shall be, subject to
review and reasonable approval by the Parent and shall include information
regarding the Company, the terms of the Merger, this Agreement and the Related
Agreements, and the recommendation of the Company Board to adopt and approve
this Agreement and the other Transactions, and approve the Merger, and a
statement that the Company Board has unanimously determined that the terms of
the Merger and this Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of the
Company and the Company Stockholders. Anything to the contrary contained
herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not include in the Soliciting
Materials any information with respect to the Parent, the form and content of
which shall not have been approved by the Parent prior to such inclusion.

 



 

5.14 _Notice of Appraisal Rights; Section 228(e) Notice_. Promptly following
receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approvals, and in any event within two
(2) Business Days thereafter, unless a later date is specified by the Parent,
the Company (or, if after the Effective Time, the Holder Representative) shall
cause to be sent to any Company Stockholders that are entitled thereto (a) the
notice of the availability of appraisal rights required by Section 262 of the
DGCL and (b) the notice required by Section 228(e) of the DGCL, in each case
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent.

 



 

5.15 _Cash Reserve_. In furtherance, and not in limitation, of _Section
6.2(r)_, as of the Effective Time, the Company shall have established the Cash
Reserve. From and after the Effective Time through that date that is ninety
(90) days thereafter (the " _Release Date_ "), the Surviving Corporation shall
pay or cause to be paid when due, out of the Cash Reserve, all Company
Liabilities and any other debts and liabilities (whether accrued or fixed,
matured or unmatured, current or long-term, including, without limitation, all
accrued expenses of the Companys financial and legal advisors or any other
service providers) payable by the Company through the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any such debt or liability of the
Company remains unpaid after the Closing, irrespective of whether such debt or
liability has been accurately reflected on the Closing Balance Sheets, such
debt or liability shall be deemed a "Company Liability" for purposes of this
Agreement and shall be payable by the Surviving Corporation out of the Cash
Reserve. At the Holder Representatives reasonable request, the Surviving
Corporation shall provide the Holder Representative with a statement of all
disbursements that have been made from the Cash Reserve and, if so requested,
shall also provide paid-in-full receipts (or other evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder Representative) for each such payment. Solely to
the extent that a Company Liability is not reflected on the Closing Balance
Sheet, the Surviving Corporation shall provide the Holder Representative with
prior written notice of its intent to make such payment (a " _Payment Notice_
") no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated date of such
payment (a " _Reserve Disbursement_ "). The Holder Representative may object
to the making of a Reserve Disbursement by delivering to the Surviving
Corporation no later than two (2) Business Days after receipt of the
applicable Payment Notice a written notice setting forth the reason for such
objection (an " _Objection Notice_ "). If the Holder Representative fails to
deliver an Objection Notice before the expiration of the two (2) Business Day
period provided above, the Reserve

 



      
 

 



 

Disbursement shall be deemed to have been accepted by the Holder
Representative. If the Holder Representative delivers an Objection Notice
before the expiration of the two (2) Business Day period provided above, the
Surviving Corporation and the Holder Representative shall negotiate in good
faith to promptly resolve such objection. On the Release Date, the Surviving
Corporation shall disburse to the Holder Representative the balance (if any)
of the Cash Reserve (less any amounts then subject to an Objection Notice,
which shall be disbursed, to the extent applicable, promptly following the
resolution of such objection in accordance with the terms of this Agreement)
for disbursement to the Company Stockholders in accordance with their Pro Rata
Share.

 



 

5.16 _Parent Antony Payment_. Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of
the Antony Separation and Release Agreement, Parent shall pay the Parent
Antony Payment. For the avoidance of doubt, except for the Parent Antony
Payment, Parent shall have no liability for severance, termination or other
payments or obligations of a similar nature to any Employee, service provider,
consultant or independent contractor of the Company, including, without
limitation, Paul Anthony, that are incurred or payable in connection with the
effectuation of the Transactions.

reasonable efforts to advocate with the SEC for the registration of the
maximum number of the Registrable Securities permitted by SEC Guidance), of
the Registrable Securities and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a
Registration Statement to be declared effective (including, without
limitation, the execution of any required undertaking to file post-effective
amendments) as promptly as possible. The Registration

 



      
 

 



 

Statement shall be on Form S-3 (except if the Parent fails to meet one or more

under Rule 144 and any contractual agreements with the Parent. The period of
time during which the Parent is required hereunder to keep the Registration

for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose; and

the Registration Statement or the prospectus so that, as of such date, the
statements therein are not misleading and do not omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
the case of the prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading;

 



      
 

 



 

(c) use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of any
order suspending the effectiveness of any Registration Statement as soon as
reasonably practicable;

 



 

(d) if the Holder Representative so requests in writing, promptly furnish to
the Holder Representative, without charge, at least one copy of such
Registration Statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, including
financial statements and schedules, and, if explicitly requested, all exhibits

many additional copies as the Holder Representative may reasonably request;
and the Parent consents to the use, consistent with the provisions hereof, of
the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by the Holder
Representative in connection with the offering and sale of the Registrable
Securities covered by the prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto;

(ii) if explicitly requested, any exhibits filed with respect to the
foregoing;

 



 

(g) upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by _Section 7.3(b)(iv)_
above, except for such times as the Parent is permitted hereunder to suspend
the use of the prospectus forming part of the Registration Statement, the
Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to as soon as reasonably
practicable prepare a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement
or a supplement to the related prospectus, or file any other required document
so that, as thereafter delivered to the Holder Representative, the prospectus
will not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading;

 



 

(h) comply in all material respects with all applicable rules and regulations

(i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Registrable

or any amendment or supplement thereto by or on behalf of the Holder
Representative if such comments would require a delay in the filing of such
Registration Statement, amendment or supplement, as the case may be.

 



 

7.4 _Furnishing Information_. It shall be a condition precedent to the
obligations of the Parent to take any action pursuant to _Section 7.1_ that
the selling Company Stockholders shall furnish to the Parent such information

method of disposition of such securities as shall be legally required under
the Securities Act or otherwise required by the SEC to effect the registration
of their Registrable Securities.

 



 

7.5 _Indemnification; Contribution_.

 



 

(a) The Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each Company Stockholder
(including the employees, agents, representatives, officers and directors of
the Company Stockholder and its Affiliates) and each Person who controls such
Company Stockholder (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act) (each a " _Registration Holder Indemnitee_ ") from and against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable
costs of investigation and reasonable legal fees) arising out of or based upon
(i) any untrue, or allegedly untrue, statement of a material fact contained in
any Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or
notification or offering circular prepared by the Parent in connection with
the registration and/or offering of the Registrable Securities (as amended or
supplemented if the Parent shall have furnished any amendments or supplements
thereto) or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as the same are
caused by or contained in any information concerning such Company Stockholder
furnished in writing to the Parent by such Company Stockholder expressly for
use in such document or (ii) any violation or alleged violation by the Parent
(or any of its agents or Affiliates) of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any state securities law, or any rule or regulation promulgated under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or any state securities law.

 



 

(b) Each Company Stockholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Parent, and
its directors, officers, employees and each Person who controls the Parent
(within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable costs of investigation) arising out of or based upon any
untrue, or allegedly untrue, statement of a material fact contained in any

 



      
 

 



 

Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or notification
or offering circular prepared by the Parent in connection with the
registration and/or offering of the Registrable Securities (as amended or
supplemented if the Parent shall have furnished any amendments or supplements
thereto) or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, if such statement or omission was
made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information concerning such
Company Stockholder furnished in writing to the Parent by such Company
Stockholder specifically for use in the preparation of such document.

 



 

(c) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (the " _Registration
Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give prompt written notice to the indemnifying
party (the " _Registration Indemnifying Party_ ") after the receipt by the
Registration Indemnified Party of any written notice of the commencement of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation or threat thereof made in
writing for which the Registration Indemnified Party intends to claim
indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however,
that the failure to so notify the Registration Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Registration Indemnifying Party of any liability that it may have
to the Registration Indemnified Party hereunder unless, and only to the extent
that, such failure results in the Registration Indemnifying Partys forfeiture
of substantive rights or defenses. If notice of commencement of any such
action is given to the Registration Indemnifying Party as above provided, the
Registration Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in and, to
the extent it may wish, jointly with any other Registration Indemnifying Party
similarly notified, to assume the defense of such action at its own expense,
with counsel chosen by it and reasonably satisfactory to such Registration
Indemnified Party. The Registration Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel (other than reasonable
costs of investigation) shall be paid by the Registration Indemnified Party
unless (i) the Registration Indemnifying Party agrees to pay the same, (ii)
the Registration Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of such action
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Registration Indemnified Party in
its reasonable judgment or (iii) the named parties to any such action
(including any impleaded parties) have been advised by such counsel that
either (x) representation of such Registration Indemnified Party and the
Registration Indemnifying Party by the same counsel would be inappropriate
under applicable standards of professional conduct or (y) there may be one or
more legal defenses available to it which are different from or additional to
those available to the Registration Indemnifying Party. In either of such
cases, the Registration Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume
the defense of such action on behalf of such Registration Indemnified Party.
No Registration Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any settlement entered
into without its written consent (other than in the case where the
Registration Indemnifying Party is unconditionally released from liability and
its rights are not adversely effected), which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



 

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.5_ from the
Registration Indemnifying Party pursuant to applicable law is unavailable to a
Registration Indemnified Party hereunder in respect of any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then the Registration
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Registration Indemnified
Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Registration
Indemnified Party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the Registration Indemnifying

 



      
 

 



 

Party and Registration Indemnified Party in connection with the actions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative faults of such
Registration Indemnifying Party and Registration Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in
question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been made by, or
relates to information supplied by, such Registration Indemnifying Party or
Registration Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The
amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject
to the limitations set forth in _Sections 7.5(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(c)_ , any
legal or other fees, charges or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this _Section
7.5(d)_ were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person.

 



 

7.6 _Rule 144 Reporting_. In order to make the benefits of the rules and
regulations of the SEC that may permit the sale of the Registrable Securities
to the public without registration available to the Company Stockholder, the
Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to:

 



 

(a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood
and defined in Rule 144(c)(1) or any similar or analogous rule promulgated
under the Securities Act, at all times after the effective date of the
Registration Statement;

 



 

(b) file with the SEC, in a timely manner, all reports and other documents
required of the Parent under the Exchange Act; and

 



 

(c) so long as the Company Stockholders own any Registrable Securities,
furnish the Holder Representative forthwith upon request: (i) a written
statement by the Parent as to its compliance with the reporting requirements
of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, and of the Exchange Act; (ii) a copy of
the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Parent; and (iii) such other
reports and documents as any Company Stockholder may reasonably request in
availing itself of any rule of regulation of the SEC allowing it to sell any
such securities without registration.

 



 

7.7 _Assignment of Registration Rights_. The rights and obligations under this
_ARTICLE VII_ may be assigned by the Company Stockholder in connection with
any permitted transfer or assignment of Registrable Securities provided that
(i) the Company Stockholder, within thirty (30) days after such transfer,
furnishes to the Parent written notice of the name and address of such
transferee or assignee and the securities with respect to which such
registration rights are being assigned, and (ii) such transferee agrees to be
subject to all obligations and restrictions with respect to the Registrable
Securities set forth in this Agreement.

Representations_ ") shall so survive but shall terminate at 11:59 P.M. Eastern
time on the date on which all applicable statutes of limitation (as the same
may be extended or waived) shall have expired, and except, in all cases, with
respect to any Loss, claim or breach of which any Parent Indemnified Party
shall have provided written notice to the Holder Representative prior to such
termination.

 



 

(b) _Parent and Merger Sub Representations_. The representations and
warranties of the Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Parent or Merger Sub as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of

Eastern time on the earlier of the date that is (i) ninety (90) days after the
Surviving Corporations achievement of the first Milestone Event or (ii)

otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or in such certificate,
document or other instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Effect of Survival Periods_. The survival periods set forth in this
_Section 8.1_ are intended to operate only as the time periods within which a
party must deliver to the other party a written notice of a Loss, claim or
breach, and following such delivery the notifying party shall be entitled to
pursue its available remedies with respect to such Loss, claim or breach
pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement until such time that it is fully
and finally resolved.

 



 

8.2 _Indemnification by the Primary Company Stockholders_. As an integral term
of the Merger, the Primary Company Stockholders, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify,

 



      
 

 



 

reimburse, compensate and hold harmless the Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
partners, members, agents and Affiliates (the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_
") against any and all claims, losses, royalties, liabilities, damages
(including solely with respect to Third Party Claims and not with respect to
any other claims, punitive, special, exemplary or similar damages claimed by
such third person), deficiencies, Taxes, interest and penalties, costs and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses, and reasonable
expenses of investigation and defense (collectively " _Losses_ ") incurred or
suffered by any such Parent Indemnified Parties directly or indirectly as a
result of, with respect to or in connection with:

 



 

(a) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Company set forth
herein or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement to be true and correct in all
respects as of the Agreement Date and as of the Closing (or, if a
representation or warranty is made as of a specified date, as of such date)
(disregarding for purposes of this _Section 8.2(a)_ any "material," "in all
material respects," "Company Material Adverse Effect," or similar
qualification contained therein or with respect thereto solely for purposes of
calculating Losses but not with respect to the determination of whether any
breach of any such representation or warranty has occurred);

 



 

(b) any failure by the Company or the Holder Representative to fully perform,
fulfill or comply with any covenant or agreement set forth herein;

 



 

(c) any Dissenting Share Payments;

 



 

(d) the failure of any item required to be set forth in the Allocation
Certificate pursuant to _Section 2.6(c)_ hereof (including, without
limitation, (i) the amount of: (x) the Closing Consideration payable to each
Company Stockholder; and (y) required withholding (if any) with respect to
each Company Stockholder and (ii) the Pro Rata Share of each Company
Stockholder and Primary Company Stockholder) to be accurate, true and correct
in all respects as of the Closing (regardless of any approval of the
Allocation Certificate by the Parent);

 



 

(e) any claims by (i) any current or former Company Stockholder or alleged
current or former holder of any equity or ownership interest or equity
security of the Company, including Company Securities or Security Rights with
respect thereto, relating to or arising out of (A) the Transactions, this
Agreement or any Related Agreement, including the allocation of the Merger
Consideration, or (B) such Persons status or alleged status as an equity
holder or ownership of equity or ownership interests in the Company (including
any predecessors) at any time at or prior to the Closing, whether for breach
of fiduciary duty or otherwise, (ii) any Person to the effect that such Person
is entitled to any equity or ownership interest or equity security or any
payment in connection with the Transactions other than as specifically set
forth on the Allocation Certificate or (iii) any Person with respect to any
Security Right, stock option scheme or plan, unit option scheme or plan or any
other scheme, plan, policy or Contract providing for equity or ownership
interest compensation to any Person in respect of the Company;

 



 

(f) any claims with respect thereto, relating to or arising out of the
Acquisition Expenses (it being understood that all Acquisition Expenses shall
have been fully

 



      
 

 



 

satisfied, paid and discharged as of the Closing, other than Acquisition
Expenses to be paid out of the Cash Reserve as noted on the statement of
Acquisition Expenses);

 



 

(g) excluding any Taxes reserved for on the Closing Balance Sheet, any Taxes
reflected in the Acquisition Expenses (but for avoidance of doubt, only to
avoid double counting Taxes that must be paid off prior to Closing pursuant to
this Agreement), and any Taxes withheld by Parent pursuant to _Section
2.6(d)_, all Taxes (or the non-payment thereof) of the Company for all taxable
periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion through the end
of the Closing Date for any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date ("Pre-Closing Tax Period"), (ii) all Taxes of any member of
an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company
(or any predecessor) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date,
including pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous or
similar state, local, or non-U.S. law or regulation, and (iii) any and all
Taxes of any person (other than the Company) imposed on the Company as a
transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule, or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before the
Closing Date, provided that the Primary Company Stockholders and each Company
Stockholder that is not a Primary Company Stockholder shall have no obligation
to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties against any Losses consisting of
Income Taxes resulting from, and any Losses otherwise relating to, a Code §338
election with respect to the acquisition of Company Capital Stock pursuant to
this Agreement, and the Parent Indemnified Parties agree to hold harmless and
indemnify each Holder for any Losses directly or indirectly incurred by such
Holder as a result of such an election.

 



 

(h) In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, receipts, or payroll of the Company for the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable
period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Company
holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time) and the
amount of other Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period that relates to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the
entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the
number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period; or

 



 

(i) any Indebtedness or liabilities (current or long-term) of the Company
required to be set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet outstanding as of the
Closing (it being understood that the Company shall be free of Indebtedness
and other debts and liabilities (other than Closing Liabilities) at and as of
the Closing), except to the extent that any such Indebtedness or liability is
satisfied out of the Cash Reserve.

 



 

8.3 _Indemnification by the Parent_. As an integral term of the Merger, the
Parent shall indemnify, reimburse, compensate and hold harmless each Company
Stockholder and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
partners, members, agents and Affiliates (the " _Holder Indemnified Parties_
") against any and all Losses incurred or suffered by any such Holder
Indemnified Parties directly or indirectly as a result of, with respect to or
in connection with:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) the failure of any representation or warranty of the Parent or Merger Sub
set forth herein or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Parent
as expressly contemplated by this Agreement to be true and correct in all
respects as of the Agreement Date and as of the Closing (disregarding for
purposes of this _Section 8.3(a)_ any "material," "in all material respects,"
"Parent Material Adverse Effect," or similar qualification contained therein
or with respect thereto solely for purposes of calculating Losses but not with
respect to the determination of whether any breach of any such representation
or warranty has occurred); and

 



 

(b) any failure by the Parent or Merger Sub to fully perform, fulfill or
comply with any covenant or agreement set forth herein or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

8.4 _Limitations_.

 



 

(a) _Threshold Amount for Indemnification by the Primary Company
Stockholders_. No claim may be made by any Parent Indemnified Party for
indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_, other than a claim arising from
any breach or inaccuracy of any of the Fundamental Representations (in each
case for which a claim may be made without regard to the limitations in this
_Section 8.3(a)_), unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses for which
the Parent Indemnified Parties seek to be indemnified pursuant to _Section
8.2(a)_ exceeds $150,000, at which time the Parent Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification for all such Losses (including all Losses
included within such amount).

 



 

(b) _Caps on Indemnification by the Primary Company Stockholders_. The maximum
aggregate obligation of the Primary Company Stockholders for Losses in respect
of indemnification under _Section 8.2(a)_ shall equal fifteen percent (15%)
of the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration actually received by the
Company Stockholders (including any Milestone Payments that are made and
irrespective of whether any such Merger Consideration is paid in Parent Shares
or cash) other than with respect to a claim for indemnification based upon,
arising out of, with respect to or by reason of any inaccuracy in or breach of
any of the Fundamental Representations, in which case the maximum aggregate
obligation of the Company Stockholders shall equal the aggregate amount of
Merger Consideration actually received by the Company Stockholders (including
any Milestone Payments that are made and irrespective of whether any such
Merger Consideration is paid in Parent Shares or cash).

 



 

(c) _Threshold Amount for Indemnification by the Parent_. No claim may be made
by any Holder Indemnified Party for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.3_
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Holder
Indemnified Parties seek to be indemnified pursuant to _Section 8.3_ exceeds
$150,000, at which time the Holder Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification for all such Losses (including all Losses included within such
amount).

 



 

(d) _Caps on Indemnification by the Parent_. The maximum aggregate obligation
of the Parent for Losses in respect of indemnification under _Section 8.3_
shall equal fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate amount of Merger
Consideration actually received by the Holders (including any Milestone
Payments that are made and irrespective of whether any such Merger
Consideration is paid in Parent Shares or cash).

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Calculation_. Any Losses as to which indemnification provided for in
_Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ may apply shall be determined net of any
actual cash recovery actually received by an Indemnified Party with respect to
insurance specifically with respect to the specific matter for which
indemnification is sought, less any current or prospective costs associated
with obtaining such recovery. This _Section 8.3(e)_ shall not imply and shall
not be construed to imply any obligation on the part of any Person to seek or
pursue any such recovery and the failure to seek or pursue any such recovery
shall not be a defense to any indemnification obligation hereunder.

 



 

(f) _Exclusive Remedy for Monetary Damages; Other Rights and Remedies Not
Affected_. Subject to _Section 8.3(g)_, the parties agrees that the sole and
exclusive remedy for money damages for any matter arising under this Agreement
shall be the rights to indemnification set forth in this Agreement and the
rights set forth in _ARTICLE IX_. The indemnification rights of the
Indemnified Parties under this _ARTICLE VIII_ are independent of and in
addition to such rights and remedies as the parties may have at Law or in
equity or otherwise for any misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure
to fulfill any agreement or covenant hereunder on the part of any party
hereto, including the right to seek specific performance, rescission or
restitution, none of which rights or remedies shall be affected or diminished
hereby.

 



 

(g) _Fraud_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
limitations and thresholds and other provisions set forth in this _ARTICLE
VIII_ shall not apply with respect to (i) fraud or intentional
misrepresentation or (ii) any equitable remedy, including a preliminary or
permanent injunction or specific performance.

 



 

(h) _Effect of Disclosure Schedule_. The disclosures set forth in the
Disclosure Schedule shall affect only the representations and warranties to
which they relate and the indemnification provisions set forth in _Section
8.2(a)_; they shall not have any effect on or in any other way limit the
indemnification provisions set forth in _Sections 8.2(b)-(h)_ which shall
have independent effect regardless of any disclosure in the Disclosure
Schedule or otherwise.

 



 

(i) _Set-Off_. The Company and the Company Stockholders hereby expressly
acknowledge and agree that the Parent shall have the right, but not the
obligation, at its election, to fully and completely offset against any
Milestone Payment that may be or become due to a Primary Company Stockholder,
(i) any and all Losses finally determined to be owed by such Primary Company
Stockholder to any Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_
and (ii) any and all amounts otherwise finally determined to be owed by such
Primary Company Stockholder to the Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to this Agreement or any other document or instrument
executed in connection with the Transactions expressly contemplated in this
Agreement.

 



 

8.5 _Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _General_. If an Indemnified Party desires to bring a claim for
indemnification hereunder, such Indemnified Party (or a duly appointed
representative of such Indemnified party on such Indemnified Partys behalf)
shall first deliver to the Holder

 



      
 

 



 

Representative, if such Indemnified Party is a Parent Indemnified Party, or to
the Parent, if such Indemnified Party is a Holder Indemnified Party, a
certificate (a " _Claim Certificate_ ") that:

 



 

(i) states that the Indemnified Party has paid or properly accrued Losses, or
reasonably anticipates that it may or will incur liability for Losses, for
which such Indemnified Party may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) specifies in reasonable detail, to the extent practicable and available,
the Losses included in the amount so stated, the basis for any anticipated
liability and the nature of the misrepresentation, default, breach of warranty
or breach of covenant or claim to which each such item is related and, to the
extent computable, the computation of the amount to which such Indemnified
Party claims to be entitled hereunder.

 



 

(b) _Objection_. If the Holder Representative, with respect to a Claim
Certificate delivered by a Parent Indemnified Party, or the Parent, with
respect to a Claim Certificate delivered by a Holder Indemnified Party,
objects to the indemnification of an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim
or claims specified in such Claim Certificate, the Holder Representative or
the Parent, as applicable, shall deliver a written notice specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for such objection and the amount in dispute to
the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after delivery of such Claim
Certificate. Thereafter, Holder Representative or the Parent, as applicable
and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights
of the respective parties for a period of not less than sixty (60) days after
delivery to the Indemnified Party of such written objection with respect to
each of such claims to which the Holder Representative or the Parent, as
applicable has objected. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
agree with respect to any of such claims, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly prepare and sign a memorandum setting forth
such agreement. Should Parent, with respect to a Claim Certificate delivered
by a Holder Indemnified Party, or the Holder Representative with respect to a
Claim Certificate delivered by a Parent Indemnified Party, fail to respond to
a Claim Certificate within thirty (30) days of delivery of such Claim
Certificate, or should the Indemnified Party and Parent or the Holder
Representative, as applicable, fail to agree as to any particular item or
items or amount or amounts within the sixty (60) day period specified in this
_Section 8.5(b)_, then either party shall be entitled to pursue its available
remedies for resolving its claim for indemnification.

 



 

(c) _Indemnified Party Defense; Settlement_.

 



 

(i) The Holder Representative shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of a claim brought by any third party, including any Governmental Body
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), that is subject to a claim for indemnification by
a Parent Indemnified Party, and the Parent shall be entitled to assume and
control the defense of a Third Party Claim that is subject to a claim for
indemnification by a Holder Indemnified Party (regardless of whether the
Holder Representative or the Parent, as applicable, has objected or intends to
object to such claim pursuant to _Section 8.5(b)_), in each case at its own
expense and through counsel of its choice (such counsel to be reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnified Party) if it gives notice of its intention to do
so to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of the delivery of the
Claim Certificate with respect to such claim; provided, however, that the
Holder Representative or the Parent, as applicable, shall not have the right
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim if

 



      
 

 



 

(i) such claim seeks, in addition to or in lieu of Losses, any injunctive or
other equitable relief, (ii) there is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of
interest that would make it inappropriate (in the judgment of the Indemnified
Party in its reasonable discretion) for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, or (iii) settlement of, or an
adverse judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim may establish (in the
reasonable good faith judgment of the Indemnified Party) a precedential custom
or practice adverse to the business interests of the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any
Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying
Partys right to control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, provided, that
if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party: (A) there
are legal defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from
or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (B) there
exists a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified
Party in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel
is required. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Holder
Representative or the Parent, as applicable, in such defense and make
available to the Holder Representative or the Parent at the Holder
Representatives or the Parents expense, as applicable, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys
possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto as is
reasonably requested by the Holder Representative or the Parent, as
applicable.

 



 

(ii) In the event the Holder Representative (with respect to a Third Party
Claim that is subject to an indemnification claim by a Parent Indemnified
Party), or the Parent (with respect to a Third Party Claim that is subject to
an indemnification claim by a Holder Indemnified Party) elects not to defend
such Third Party Claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Party in writing of
its election to defend such Third Party Claim as provided in this Agreement
within thirty (30) days of delivery of the Claim Certificate with respect
thereto, or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section 8.5(c)(iii)_, pay,
compromise, defend such Third Party Claim (at the Indemnifying Partys sole
cost and expense with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party) and seek
indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to
such Third Party Claim.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall not enter into settlement of any Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, except as provided in this
_Section 8.5(c)(iii)_. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim
without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary
form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all
liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying
Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10)
calendar days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall
not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails
to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such

 



      
 

 



 

Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim
upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim.
If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section
8.5(c)(ii)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent
of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed).

 



 

(d) _Agreed Claims_. Claims for Losses specified in any Claim Certificate to
which the Indemnifying Party did not object in writing by 11:59 PM Eastern
time on the forty-fifth (45th) day following the receipt by the Indemnifying
Party of such Claim Certificate, claims for Losses covered by a memorandum of
agreement of the nature described in _Section 8.5(b)_ and claims for Losses
the validity and amount of which have been the subject of resolution by
arbitration or of a final non-appealable judicial determination are
hereinafter referred to, collectively, as " _Agreed Claims_." The Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to payment for any Agreed Claim within ten (10)
Business Days of the determination of the amount of any such Agreed Claims.

 



 

(e) _Timing of Claim Certificate_. A Claim Certificate shall be delivered
reasonably promptly (but in any event not later than sixty (60) calendar days)
after receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim by an Indemnified Party of
notice of any Third Party Claim or any facts and circumstances giving rise to
a claim for indemnification hereunder, provided that, the failure to deliver a
timely Claim Certificate shall not release an Indemnifying Party from any of
its obligations under this _ARTICLE VIII_ except and only to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the defense of such claim.

 



 

(f) _Contingent Claims_. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent an
Indemnified Party from making a claim hereunder for potential or contingent
claims or demands; provided that the Claim Certificate sets forth the specific
basis for any such contingent claim to the extent then feasible and the
Indemnified Party has reasonable grounds to believe that such a claim may be
made.

 



 

8.6 _Merger Consideration Adjustment_. The Company, the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Holder Representative and the Company Stockholders agree to
treat each indemnification payment pursuant to this _ARTICLE VIII_ as an
adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes and shall take no
position contrary thereto unless required to do so by applicable Tax Law
pursuant to a determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 



 

8.7 _No Subrogation_. Following the Closing, no Company Stockholder shall have
any right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation against the Company
with respect to any indemnification payment made by or on behalf of any
Company Stockholder under _Section 8.2_ if the Merger and the Transactions
are consummated.

 



 

8.8 _No Prejudice_. The representations, warranties, covenants and obligations
of the Company, set forth in this Agreement or in or in any certificate
delivered by or on behalf of the Company as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement, as limited by the Disclosure Schedules, and the rights and remedies
that may be exercised by the Indemnified Parties based on such
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations, will not be limited or
affected by any

 



      
 

 



 

investigation conducted by the Parent or Merger Sub or any agent of the Parent
or Merger Sub with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) by the Parent or Merger Sub or any agent of the Parent or Merger Sub
at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the Closing, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with or performance of any such representation, warranty, covenant
or obligation, and no Parent Indemnified Party shall be required to show that
it relied on any (and each Parent Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have
relied on each) such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of the
Company in order to be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _ARTICLE
VIII_. The waiver by the Parent or Merger Sub of any of the conditions set
forth in _ARTICLE VI_ will not affect or limit the provisions of this
_ARTICLE VIII_.

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX. 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 



 

9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Transactions
abandoned at any time prior to the Closing Date, regardless of whether this
Agreement and/or the Merger have been approved by the Company Stockholders, as
follows and in no other manner:

 



 

(a) by written agreement of the Company, the Parent and Merger Sub;

 



 

(b) by either the Parent or the Company if: (i) the Closing Date has not
occurred on, or prior to, the third Business Day after the date hereof (the "
_Termination Date_ "); provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _clause 9.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party whose
failure to fulfill any obligation hereunder has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Closing Date to occur on or before the Termination Date
and such action or failure constitutes a breach of this Agreement; (ii) there
shall be a final non-appealable order of a Governmental Body in effect
preventing consummation of the Merger; or (iii) there shall be any Law
enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any
Governmental Body that would make consummation of the Merger illegal;

 



 

(c) by the Parent if there shall have been any action taken, or any Law
enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Transactions, by
any Governmental Entity which would: (i) prohibit the Parents or the
Companys ownership or operation of any portion of the business of the Company
or (ii) compel the Parent or the Company to dispose of or hold separate, as a
result of the Transactions, any portion of the business or assets of the
Parent or the Company;

 



 

(d) by the Parent if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company
and as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_
or _6.2(b)_ , as the case may be, would not then be satisfied; provided, that
if such breach is curable by the Company prior to the Termination Date through
the exercise of its commercially reasonable efforts, then the Parent may not
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(d)_ prior to the earlier of
the Termination Date or the date that is fifteen (15) days following the
Companys receipt of written notice from the Parent of such breach, it being
understood that the Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 9.1(d)_ if such breach by the Company is cured within such period
so that the conditions would then be satisfied;

 



 

(e) by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations under
this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of the Parent or
Merger Sub and as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in _Section
6.1(a)_ or _Section 6.1(b)_, as the case may be, would not then be satisfied;

prior to the earlier of the Termination Date or the date that is fifteen (15)
days following the Parents receipt of written notice from the Company of such
breach, it being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_ if such breach by the Parent or Merger Sub
is cured within such period so that the conditions would then be satisfied; or

 



 

(f) by the Parent if there is a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Agreement, the Related Agreements, the schedules and Exhibits hereto and
thereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the documents and instruments

among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

10.3 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as

valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent
possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or
unenforceable provision.

would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not

It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction

10.6 _Successors and Assigns; Parties in Interest_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon each Company Stockholder and each of
such Company Stockholders personal representatives, executors,
administrators, estates, heirs, successors and assigns (if any), and the
Parent and Merger Sub and their respective successors and assigns, if any.
This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, the
Indemnified DandOs, the Parent Indemnified Parties, the Holder Indemnified
Parties and the respective successors and assigns (if any) of the foregoing.
No obligation of the Company in this Agreement shall become an obligation of
the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time.

under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Parent and the
Holder Representative, except that the Parent may assign its rights and
delegate its obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of the Parent without the
Holder Representatives or any other partys consent.

 



 

(c) Except as provided in the following sentence, nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person other than
a party hereto any rights, interests, benefits or other remedies of any nature
under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement is intended to benefit
the Parent Indemnified Parties, the Holder Indemnified Parties and the
Indemnified DandOs and each Parent Indemnified Party, Holder Indemnified Party

10.7 _Waiver_. No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power,
right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of
any Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other
power, right, privilege or remedy.

 



 

10.8 _Governing Law; Venue_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with, and governed in all
respects by, the Laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the Laws of
such jurisdiction that would require the substantive Laws of another
jurisdiction to apply.

 



 

(b) Unless otherwise explicitly provided in this Agreement, any action, claim,
suit or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any
provision of this Agreement shall be brought or otherwise commenced only in
any state or federal court located in the State of New Jersey. Each party
hereto (i) expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction
of each such court, and each appellate court located in the State of New
Jersey, in connection with any such proceeding; (ii) agrees that each such
court shall be deemed to be a convenient forum; (iii) agrees that service of
process in any such proceeding may be made by giving notice pursuant to
_Section 10.1_ ; and (iv) agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense
or otherwise, in any such proceeding commenced in any such court, any claim
that such party is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of such court,
that such proceeding has been

 



      
 

 



 

brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such proceeding is
improper or that this Agreement or the subject matter of this Agreement may
not be enforced in or by such court.

 



 

(c) The Company Stockholders and Holder Representative agree that, if any
claim, action, suit or proceeding is commenced against any Parent Indemnified
Party by any Person in or before any court or other tribunal anywhere in the
world, then such Parent Indemnified Party may proceed against the Holders and
Holder Representative in or before such court or other tribunal with respect
to any indemnification claim or other claim arising directly or indirectly
from or relating directly or indirectly to such claim, action, suit or
proceeding or any of the matters alleged therein or any of the circumstances
giving rise thereto.

preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
