"AGREEMENT"), by and among RGS Energy Group, Inc., a New York corporation (the

            WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company and
Parent have determined to engage in a business combination transaction on the
terms stated herein;

            WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub have approved and adopted this Agreement and deemed it in the
best interests of their respective shareholders to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein under which the businesses of the Company and Parent would
be combined by means of the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub,
which as of the Effective Time shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent; and

            WHEREAS, it is intended that the Merger (as defined below) shall
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), and that this Agreement
shall constitute a plan of reorganization;

            NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER
                                   ----------

           Section 1.1. THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), the
Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub (the "MERGER") in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York, whereupon the separate corporate

                                  ARTICLE II

                               TREATMENT OF SHARES
                               -------------------

       Section 2.1. EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder
of any capital stock of the Company or Merger Sub:

       (a) SHARES OF MERGER SUB STOCK. Each share of common stock, without par
value, of Merger Sub (the "MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK") that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and
unchanged by reason of the


                                      -2-
<PAGE>


Merger as one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, without par
value, of the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Each share of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK")
that is owned by the Company as treasury stock and all shares of Company Common
Stock that are owned by Parent shall be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

         (c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK. Subject to the provisions of
this Section 2.1, each share of Company Common Stock, other than shares canceled
pursuant to Section 2.1(b), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive (i) $39.50 in cash
(the "CASH CONSIDERATION") or (ii) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share, of Parent
("PARENT COMMON STOCK") equal to the Exchange Ratio (as defined below) (the
"STOCK CONSIDERATION") or (iii) the right to receive a combination of cash and
shares of Parent Common Stock determined in accordance with this Section (the
"MIXED CONSIDERATION"). The "Exchange Ratio" shall be equal to the Cash
Consideration divided by either (i) the Parent Share Price (as defined below) if
the Parent Share Price is equal to or less than $22.41 and equal to or more than
$16.57, (ii) $22.41 if the Parent Share Price is greater than $22.41, in which
case the Exchange Ratio shall equal 1.7626, or (iii) $16.57 if the Parent Share
Price is less than $16.57, in which case the Exchange Ratio shall equal 2.3838.
The "Parent Share Price" shall be equal to the average of the closing prices of
the shares of Parent Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE")
Composite Transactions Reporting System, as reported in The Wall Street Journal,
for the 20 trading days immediately preceding the second trading day prior to
the Effective Time.

         (d) CASH ELECTION. Subject to the immediately following sentence, each
record holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive cash for all or any part of
such holder's shares of Company Common Stock (a "CASH ELECTION").
Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Section 2.1(l), the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be converted into the right to
receive cash in the Merger (the "CASH ELECTION NUMBER") shall be 55% of the
total number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time. Cash Elections shall be made on a form designed for that purpose
(a "FORM OF ELECTION"). A holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock who
holds such shares as nominee, trustee or in another representative capacity (a
"REPRESENTATIVE") may submit multiple Forms of Election, provided that such
Representative certifies that each such Form of Election covers all the shares
of Company Common Stock held by such Representative for a particular beneficial
owner.

        (e) CASH ELECTION SHARES. If the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock covered by Cash Elections (the "CASH ELECTION SHARES") exceeds the
Cash Election Number, each Cash Election Share shall be converted into (i) the
right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(A) the Cash Consideration and (B) a fraction (the "CASH FRACTION"), the
numerator of which shall be the Cash Election Number and


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

the denominator of which shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares, and
(ii) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the
Exchange Ratio and (B) a fraction equal to one minus the Cash Fraction.

         (f) STOCK ELECTION. Subject to the immediately following sentence, each
record holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock for all or any part of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock (a
"STOCK ELECTION"). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Section 2.1(l),
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be converted
into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the
"STOCK ELECTION NUMBER") shall be 45% of the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time. Stock Elections
shall be made on a Form of Election. A Representative may submit multiple Forms
of Election, provided that such Representative certifies that each such Form of
Election covers all the shares of Company Common Stock held by such
Representative for a particular beneficial owner.

         (g) STOCK ELECTION SHARES. If the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock covered by Stock Elections (the "STOCK ELECTION SHARES") exceeds
the Stock Election Number, each Stock Election Share shall be converted into (i)
the right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock, equal to the
product of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) a fraction (the "STOCK FRACTION"), the
numerator of which shall be the Stock Election Number and the denominator of
which shall be the total number of Stock Election Shares, and (ii) an amount in
cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the Cash Consideration and
(B) a fraction equal to one minus the Stock Fraction.

         (h) MIXED ELECTION. Subject to the immediately following sentence, each
record holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be entitled to elect to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock for part of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock and cash for the
remaining part of such holder's shares of Company Common Stock (the "MIXED
ELECTION" and, collectively with Stock Election and Cash Election, the
"ELECTION"). Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to Section 2.1(l), the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be converted into
the right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be 55%, and the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock that may be converted into the right to
receive shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall be 45%, in each case,
of the total number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as
of the Effective Time. Mixed Elections shall be made on a Form of Election. A
Representative may submit multiple Forms of Election, provided that such
Representative certifies that each such Form of Election covers all the shares
of Company Common Stock held by such Representative for a particular beneficial
owner. With respect to each holder of Company Common Stock who makes a Mixed
Election, the shares of Company Common Stock such holder elects to be converted
into the right to receive Cash Consideration shall be treated as Cash Election
Shares for purposes of the provisions contained in Sections 2.1(d), (e) and (l),
and the shares such holder elects to be converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be treated as Stock Election Shares for
purposes of the provisions contained in Sections 2.1(f), (g) and (l).


                                      -4-

         (i) FORM OF ELECTION. To be effective, a Form of Election must be
properly completed, signed and submitted to Parent's transfer agent and
registrar, as paying agent (the "PAYING AGENT"), and accompanied by the
certificates representing the shares of Company Common Stock ("COMPANY
CERTIFICATES") as to which the election is being made (or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery of such Company Certificate signed by a firm that is a
member of any registered national securities exchange or a member of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a bank, broker, dealer,
credit union, savings association or other entity that is a member in good
standing of the Securities Transfer Agent's Medallion Program, the New York
Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Guarantee Program or the Stock Exchange
Medallion Program). Parent shall have the discretion, which it may delegate in
whole or in part to the Paying Agent, to determine whether Forms of Election
have been properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked and to disregard
immaterial defects in Forms of Election. The decision of Parent (or the Paying
Agent) in such matters shall be conclusive and binding. Neither Parent nor the
Paying Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any person of any defect in
a Form of Election submitted to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent shall also
make all computations contemplated by this Section 2.1, and all such
computations shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock.

        (j) DEEMED NON-ELECTION. For the purposes hereof, a holder of shares of
Company Common Stock who does not submit a Form of Election that is received by
the Paying Agent prior to the Election Deadline (as defined in Section 2.1(k))
(the "NO ELECTION SHARES") shall be deemed not to have made a Cash Election,
Stock Election or Mixed Election. If Parent or the Paying Agent shall determine
that any purported Election was not properly made, the shares subject to such
improperly made Election shall be treated as No Election Shares. No Election
Shares may be treated as Cash Election Shares or Stock Election Shares.

        (k) ELECTION DEADLINE. Parent and the Company shall each use its best
efforts to cause copies of the Form of Election to be mailed to the record
holders of the shares of Company Common Stock not less than thirty days prior to
the Effective Time and to make the Form of Election available to all persons who
become record holders of shares of Company Common Stock subsequent to the date
of such mailing and no later than the close of business on the seventh business
day prior to the Effective Time. A Form of Election must be received by the
Paying Agent by 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third day after the
Effective Time (the "ELECTION DEADLINE") in order to be effective. All elections
may be revoked until the Election Deadline in writing by the record holders
submitting Forms of Election.

       (l) ADJUSTMENT PER TAX OPINION. Notwithstanding anything in this Article
II to the contrary (other than the last sentence of Section 2.1(m)), unless the
Company elects to change the form of the Merger in accordance with this Section
2.1(l), the number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration in the Merger shall be not less than
that number which would cause the ratio of (i) the value, for federal income tax
purposes, per share of Parent Common Stock on the Closing Date times the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be paid as Stock
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c), to (ii) the sum of (A) the amount set
forth in the preceding clause (i) plus (B) the aggregate Cash Consideration to
be issued pursuant to Section 2.1(c) plus (C) any other amounts paid by Parent
or the Company (or any affiliate thereof) to, or on behalf of, any Company


                                      -5-
<PAGE>

shareholder in connection with the sale, redemption or other disposition of any
Company stock in connection with the Merger for purposes of Treasury Regulation
Sections 1.368-1(e) plus (D) any extraordinary dividend distributed by the
Company prior to and in connection with the Merger for purposes of Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.368-1(e), to be 42.5%. To the extent the application of
this Section 2.1(l) would reasonably be expected to result in the number of
shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the
Stock Consideration in the Merger being increased, the Company may elect by
written notice received by Parent no later than two business days prior to the
Effective Time to change the form of the Merger in lieu of such an increase;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such election does not delay the consummation of the
Merger. If the Company so elects, this Agreement shall be amended to provide for
the payment of the Merger Consideration (without adjustment under this Section
2.1(l)) pursuant to a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the
Company being the Surviving Corporation (the "REVERSE MERGER"). The Reverse
Merger would not be intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code, and the conditions of Sections 8.2(g) and 8.3(f)
hereof would be waived. If the Company does not make such election, then the
number of shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration shall be increased to the extent required by
this Section 2.1(l), and the number of such shares to be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration will be reduced to the same extent.

         (m) ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS. In the event Parent (i) changes (or
establishes a record date for changing) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock
split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization, reclassification,
reorganization or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Parent
Common Stock or (ii) pays or makes an extraordinary dividend or distribution in
respect of Parent Common Stock (other than a distribution referred to in clause
(i) of this sentence) and, in either case, the record date therefor shall be
prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration (as defined in Section
2.2(b)) shall be proportionately adjusted. Regular quarterly cash dividends and
increases thereon shall not be considered extraordinary for purposes of the
preceding sentence. If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, Parent
shall merge or consolidate with or into any other corporation (a "PARENT
BUSINESS COMBINATION") and the terms thereof shall provide that Parent Common
Stock shall be converted into or exchanged for the shares of any other
corporation or entity, then provision shall be made so that shareholders of the
Company who would be entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of each share of Parent
Common Stock issuable to such shareholders as provided herein, the same kind and
amount of securities or assets as shall be distributable upon such Parent
Business Combination with respect to one share of Parent Common Stock and the
parties hereto shall agree on an appropriate restructuring of the transactions
contemplated herein.

          Section 2.2.  EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

          (a) DEPOSIT WITH EXCHANGE AGENT. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with a bank or trust company mutually
agreeable to Parent and the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"), pursuant to an
agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company,
an amount of cash and certificates representing shares of


                                      -6-
<PAGE>

Parent Common Stock required to effect the conversion of Company Common Stock
into Parent Common Stock and cash in accordance with Section 2.1(c).

          (b) EXCHANGE AND PAYMENT PROCEDURES. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record as of the Effective Time of a Certificate or Certificates that have been
converted pursuant to Section 2.1: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon actual delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates and receiving the Merger Consideration (as defined below) to which
such holder shall be entitled therefor pursuant to Section 2.1. Upon surrender
of a Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as the Paying Agent may
require, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) a certificate representing that number of shares of Parent Common
Stock (the "PARENT SHARES") into which the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificate are converted in accordance with
Section 2.1(c), (ii) the cash to which such holder is entitled in accordance
with Section 2.1(c), and (iii) the cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares to
which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(d) (the
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash described in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
above being referred to collectively as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). In the
event the Merger Consideration is to be delivered to any person who is not the
person in whose name the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may
be delivered to a transferee if the Certificate is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence satisfactory to the Paying Agent that any applicable
stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.2, each Certificate (other than a certificate representing shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b)) shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration contemplated by this
Section 2.2. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to
holders of Certificates pursuant to provisions of this Article II.

         (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to Parent Shares
represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(d) until the holder of record of
such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the effect of
unclaimed property, escheat and other applicable laws, following surrender of
any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificates representing whole Parent Shares issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(d) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole Parent Shares and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole Parent Shares.


                                      -7-
<PAGE>


        (d) NO FRACTIONAL SECURITIES. In lieu of any such fractional securities,
each holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of Certificates for
exchange pursuant to this Article II will be paid an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from
the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all
such holders, of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issued
pursuant to this Article II. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full
shares of Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent over
(ii) the aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be
distributed to holders of Company Common Stock (such excess being herein called
the "EXCESS PARENT COMMON SHARES"). The Exchange Agent, as agent for the former
holders of Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Parent Common Shares at
the prevailing prices on the NYSE. The sales of the Excess Parent Common Shares
by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member
firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable.
Parent shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange
Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of Excess Parent Common Shares.
Until the net proceeds of such sale have been distributed to the former holders
of Company Common Stock, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for
such former holders. As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash to be paid to former holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of
any fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance
with this Agreement such amounts to such former holders.

        (e) CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for certificates representing the appropriate number of Parent
Shares and the appropriate amount of cash as provided in Section 2.1 and in this
Section 2.2.

        (f) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE AGENT. Any certificates representing Parent
Shares deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and not
exchanged within six months after the Effective Time pursuant to this Section
2.2 shall be returned by the Exchange Agent to Parent, which shall thereafter
act as Exchange Agent. All funds held by the Exchange Agent for payment to the
holders of unsurrendered Certificates and unclaimed at the end of one year from
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, after which time any holder of
unsurrendered Certificates shall look as a general creditor only to Parent for
payment of such funds to which such holder may be due, subject to applicable
law.

       (g) ESCHEAT. The Company shall not be liable to any person for such
shares or funds delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

                                     THE CLOSING
                                     -----------

         Section 3.1. CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, at 10:00 a.m.,
Eastern time, on the second business day immediately following the date on which
the last of the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof is fulfilled or
waived (other than conditions that by their nature are required to be performed
on the Closing Date, but subject to satisfaction of such conditions), or at such
other time and date and place as the Company and Parent shall mutually agree
(the "CLOSING DATE").

                                   ARTICLE IV

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY
                   ---------------------------------------------

            The Company represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

            Section 4.1. ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION. Except as set forth in
Section 4.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (as defined in Section 7.6), the
Company and each of its subsidiaries (as defined below) is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, has all requisite corporate power
and authority, and has been duly authorized by all necessary approvals and
orders, to own, lease and operate its assets and properties to the extent owned,
leased and operated and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted
and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of its assets
and properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified and in good standing would
not, when taken together with all other such failures, reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, financial condition
or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or
on the consummation of this Agreement (any such material adverse effect being
hereafter referred to as a "COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT"). As used in this
Agreement, the term "subsidiary" of a person shall mean any corporation or other
entity (including partnerships and other business associations) of which a
majority of the outstanding capital stock or other voting securities having
voting power under ordinary circumstances to elect directors or similar members
of the governing body of such corporation or entity shall at the time be held,
directly or indirectly, by such person.

         Section 4.2. SUBSIDIARIES. Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a description, as of the date hereof, of each material
"subsidiary company," as such term is defined in the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, as amended (the "1935 ACT"), and joint venture of the
Company, including the name of each such entity, the state or jurisdiction of
its incorporation or organization, the Company's interest therein and a brief
description of the principal line or lines of business conducted by each such
entity. Except as set forth in Section 4.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock owned by the Company
of each Company subsidiary are validly issued,


                                      -9-
<PAGE>


fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, and are owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of any liens, claims, encumbrances,
security interests, equities, charges and options of any nature whatsoever, and
there are no outstanding subscriptions, options, calls, contracts, voting
trusts, proxies or other commitments, understandings, restrictions,
arrangements, rights or warrants, including any right of conversion or exchange
under any outstanding security, instrument or other agreement, obligating any
such subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or
sold, additional shares of its capital stock or obligating it to grant, extend
or enter into any such agreement or commitment, except for any of the foregoing
that would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
As used in this Agreement, the term "joint venture" of a person shall mean any
corporation or other entity (including partnerships and other business
associations) that is not a subsidiary of such person, in which such person or
one or more of its subsidiaries owns an equity interest, other than equity
interests held for passive investment purposes which are less than 10% of any
class of the outstanding voting securities or equity of any such entity.

        Section 4.3. CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company ("COMPANY PREFERRED
STOCK"). As of the close of business on February 15, 2001, there were issued and
outstanding 34,577,426 shares of Company Common Stock and no shares of Company
Preferred Stock. As of the close of business on February 15, 2001, 1,010,198
shares of Company Common Stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of
outstanding Company stock options. All of the issued and outstanding shares of
the capital stock of the Company are validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable
and free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth in Section 4.3 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, as of the date hereof, there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, stock appreciation rights, calls, contracts, voting
trusts, proxies or other commitments, understandings, restrictions,
arrangements, rights or warrants, including any right of conversion or exchange
under any outstanding security, instrument or other agreement, obligating the
Company or any of the subsidiaries of the Company to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of the capital stock of
the Company, or obligating the Company to grant, extend or enter into any such
agreement or commitment.

       Section 4.4. AUTHORITY; NON-CONTRAVENTION; STATUTORY APPROVALS;
                    COMPLIANCE.

       (a) AUTHORITY. The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Company
Shareholders' Approval (as defined in Section 4.13) and the Company Required
Statutory Approvals (as defined in Section 4.4(c)), to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company, other than the Company Shareholders' Approval. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the other signatories hereto,
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms.


                                      -10-
<PAGE>


          (b) NON-CONTRAVENTION. Except as set forth in Section 4.4(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company do not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will not, violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or
result in the termination or modification of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the grant of any rights (in addition to the rights
under the employment agreements disclosed in Section 4.10(k) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule) under, or result in a right of termination, cancellation,
or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of a benefit under, or result in
the creation of any lien, security interest, charge or encumbrance ("LIENS")
upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or any of its joint ventures (any such violation, conflict, breach, default,
right of termination, modification, cancellation or acceleration, grant, loss or
creation, a "VIOLATION" with respect to the Company (such term when used in
Article V having a correlative meaning with respect to Parent)) pursuant to any
provisions of (i) the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or similar governing
documents of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of its joint ventures,
(ii) subject to obtaining the Company Required Statutory Approvals and the
receipt of the Company Shareholders' Approval, any statute, law, ordinance,
rule, regulation, judgment, decree, order, injunction, writ, permit or license
of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Company, any of its subsidiaries
or any of its joint ventures, or any of their respective properties or assets or
(iii) subject to obtaining the third-party consents or other approvals set forth
in Section 4.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "COMPANY REQUIRED
CONSENTS") any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license,
franchise, permit, concession, contract, lease or other instrument, obligation
or agreement of any kind to which the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of
its joint ventures is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets
may be bound or affected, excluding from the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) such Violations that would not reasonably be expected to have, in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect and would not prevent the
consummation of the Merger.

        (c) STATUTORY APPROVALS. Except as described in Section 4.4(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no declaration, filing or registration with, or
notice to or authorization, consent or approval of, any court, federal, state,
local or foreign governmental or regulatory body (including a stock exchange or
other self-regulatory body) or authority (each, a "GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY") is
necessary for the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company or the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, the failure
to obtain, make or give which would reasonably be expected to have, in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect or would prevent the consummation
of the Merger (the "COMPANY REQUIRED STATUTORY APPROVALS"), it being understood
that references in this Agreement to "obtaining" such Company Required Statutory
Approvals shall mean making such declarations, filings or registrations; giving
such notices; obtaining such authorizations, consents or approvals; and having
such waiting periods expire as are necessary to avoid a violation of law.

        (d) COMPLIANCE. Except as set forth in Section 4.4(d) or Section 4.11 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, or as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports (as
defined in Section 4.5) filed prior to the date hereof, neither the Company, nor
any of its subsidiaries nor any of its joint ventures is in violation of, is
under investigation with respect to any violation of, or has been given notice
or been charged with any violation of, any law, statute, order, rule,


                                      -11-
<PAGE>


regulation, ordinance or judgment (including, without limitation, any applicable
Environmental Law, as defined in Section 4.11(f)(ii)) of any Governmental
Authority except for violations that, in the aggregate, do not have and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
set forth in Section 4.4(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule or in Section
4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its subsidiaries and
joint ventures have all permits, licenses, franchises and other governmental
authorizations, consents and approvals necessary to conduct their respective
businesses as currently conducted in all respects, except those which the
failure to obtain would not reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section 4.4(d) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each of its subsidiaries are not in
breach or violation of or in default in the performance or observance of any
term or provision of, and no event has occurred which, with lapse of time or
action by a third party, could result in a default under, (i) its certificate of
incorporation or by-laws or (ii) any material contract, commitment, agreement,
indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease, bond, license, approval or
other instrument to which it is a party or by which it is bound or to which any
of its property is subject, except for breaches, violations or defaults that, in
the aggregate, do not have and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

       (e) NON-COMPETITION. Except as set forth in Section 4.4(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there is no "non-competition" or other similar contract,
commitment, agreement or understanding that materially restricts the ability of
the Company or any of its affiliates to conduct business in any geographic area
or that would reasonably be likely to materially restrict the Surviving
Corporation or any of its affiliates to conduct business in any geographic area.

material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. The audited consolidated financial
statements and unaudited interim financial statements of the Company included in
the Company SEC Reports (collectively, the "COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") have

applied on a consistent basis ("GAAP") (except as may be indicated therein or in
the notes thereto and except with respect to unaudited statements as permitted
by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly present the consolidated financial position
of the Company as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended. True, accurate and
complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company,
as in effect on the date hereof, have been made available to Parent.

       Section 4.6. ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Except as disclosed in
the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth in
Section 4.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since September 30, 2000, and
prior to the date hereof, the Company and each of its subsidiaries have
conducted their business only in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, and there has not been, and no fact or condition exists which
would have, or would reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

       Section 4.7. LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports
filed prior to the date hereof or as set forth in Section 4.7, Section 4.9 or

nor are there any investigations or reviews pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened against, relating to or affecting the Company or any of its
subsidiaries, and (b) there are no judgments, decrees, injunctions, rules or
orders of any court, governmental department, commission, agency,

the merits and that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

inclusion or incorporation by reference in (a) the registration statement on
Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC in connection with the issuance of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT") will, at the
time the Registration Statement becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein

        (e) All material contributions required to be made to any Plan by
applicable law or regulation or by any Plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all material premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Plan, for any period through the date hereof have been
timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be made or paid on
or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the Company Financial
Statements. Each Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section

       (f) With respect to each Employee Benefit Plan, except as would not have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its subsidiaries have
complied, and are now in compliance, with all provisions of ERISA, the Code and
all laws and regulations applicable to such Employee Benefit Plans and each Plan
has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms. No
provision of any material Plan limits the Company's authority to amend, modify,
suspend, revoke or terminate that Plan, other than to state a limitation
required by ERISA or the Code, and there have been no oral or written
communications to participants or beneficiaries stating a limitation other than
a limitation required by ERISA or the Code. There is not now, nor do any
circumstances exist that could reasonably be expected to give rise to, any
requirement for the posting of security with respect to a Plan or the imposition
of any lien on the assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries under ERISA
or the Code. Except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no
non-exempt prohibited transaction (as defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) has occurred with respect to any Plan.

       (g) With respect to each Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA, the
minimum funding requirements of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code,
or Section 4971 of the Code: (i) there does not exist any accumulated funding
deficiency within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA, whether or not waived, in respect of any plan year ended prior to the
date hereof and for which the time for making contributions in order to avoid
occurring an accumulated funding deficiency for such year has expired; (ii) the
fair market value of the assets of each such Plan that is a defined benefit plan
equals or exceeds the actuarial present value of the accumulated benefit
obligation under such Plan (whether or not vested), based upon the actuarial
assumptions set forth in the most recent actuarial report for such Plan; (iii)
no reportable event within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA for which the
30-day notice requirement has not been waived has occurred since December 31,
1995 in respect of any such Plan which is a defined benefit Plan; (iv) all
material premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") have been
timely paid in full; (v) no material liability (other than for premiums to the
PBGC and for the payment of benefits and contributions in the ordinary course)
under Title IV of ERISA has been or could reasonably be expected to be incurred
by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; and (vi) to the knowledge of the
Company, the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such Plan and
no condition exists that presents a material risk that such proceedings will be
instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the
termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such Plan.


                                      -17-

       (h) No Employee Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a plan that has
two or more contributing sponsors at least two of which are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "MULTIPLE EMPLOYER
PLAN"). None of the Company and its subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan. None of the Company and its subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliates has
incurred any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full.

       (i) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to result in, any Controlled Group Liability that could
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries, nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in Section
4069 or Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA since December 31, 1995.

       (j) Except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B
of the Code or Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable state law, the Company
and its subsidiaries have no material liability for life, health, medical or
other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents of
former employees.

       (k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone
or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the accelerated
funding, vesting or delivery of, or increase the amount or value of, any
material payment or benefit to any employee, officer or director of the Company
or any of its subsidiaries. Section 4.10(k) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
sets forth a reasonable estimate of (i) the maximum amount of each category of
"parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code that could
become payable by the Company and its subsidiaries (including without limitation
severance, parachute payments resulting from the vesting of options, and
enhanced retirement benefits) and (ii) the amounts required to be contributed by
the Company and its subsidiaries to any grantor trusts or other funding
arrangements for any Employee Benefit Plans and Employment Agreements, in each
case in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Section 4.10(k) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule also sets forth the aggregate amount of the dividend
equivalents payable as of the date hereof to holders of Company Options (as
defined in Section 7.11(a)).

      (l) The Company does not have any labor contracts or collective bargaining
agreements with any persons employed by the Company or any persons otherwise
performing services primarily for the Company. No labor organization or group of
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries has made a pending demand
for recognition or certification, and there are no representation or
certification proceedings or petitions seeking a representation proceeding
presently pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened to be brought
or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations
tribunal or authority. Section 4.10(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies every demand for recognition or petition to the National Labor
Relations Board for certification as collective bargaining representative of a
unit of the Company's employees within the last five years. There are no


                                      -18-
<PAGE>


organizing activities, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, material
arbitrations or material grievances, or other material labor disputes pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or involving the Company
or any of its subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is in
compliance with all applicable laws respecting employment and employment
practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages and hours and occupational
safety and health, except as would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

       (m) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, no condition or event has occurred which may reasonably be expected
to give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Plans, any fiduciaries thereof
with respect to their duties to the Plans or the assets of any of the trusts
under any of the Plans which could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Department of Treasury, the Department of
Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Plan, any participant in a Plan or any other
party.

       (n) The Company, its subsidiaries and each member of their respective
business enterprise has complied with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act.

       (o) There are no awards outstanding under the Company's Long Term
Incentive Plan. With respect to each severance agreement substantially in the
form of the severance agreements listed in Section 4.10(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (each, a "SEVERANCE AGREEMENT"), the provisions of the form
of letter agreement set forth in Section 7.11(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule represent the correct interpretation of such Severance Agreement as in
effect on the date hereof.

       Section 4.11 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION. Except as set forth in Section
4.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or in the Company SEC Reports filed
prior to the date hereof:

       (a) COMPLIANCE. Except where the failure to be in such compliance would

Environmental Law for the construction of its facilities or the conduct of its
operations, and all such Environmental Permits are in good standing or, where
required by Environmental Law, a renewal application has been timely filed and
is pending agency approval, and the Company reasonably believes that any
transfer, renewal or reapplication for any Environmental Permit required as a
result of the Merger can be


                                      -19-

accomplished in the ordinary course of business, except as would not reasonably

currently owns, leases or operates or, to the Company's knowledge, against any
real or personal property or operations that the Company or any predecessor in
interest owned, leased or operated, or (iii) to the knowledge of the Company,
against any person or entity whose liability for any Environmental Claim the
Company or any of its subsidiaries has or may have retained or assumed either
contractually or by operation of law, in whole or in part that, if adversely
determined, would reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

      (d) RELEASES. Except for Releases of Hazardous Materials the liability for
which would not reasonably be expected to have, in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, there have been no Releases (as defined in Section
4.11(f)(iv)) by the Company or any of its subsidiaries or, to the Company's
knowledge, by any other party of any Hazardous Materials (as defined in Section
4.11(f)(iii)) that would be reasonably likely to (i) form the basis of any
Environmental Claim against the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (ii) to
the knowledge of the Company, cause damage or diminution of value to any of the
operations or real properties currently owned, leased or operated, in whole or
in part, by Company or any of its subsidiaries.

      (e) CERCLA. No property currently, or to the knowledge of the Company,
formerly owned, operated or leased by the Company or by any predecessor in
interest, is listed on the National Priorities List promulgated under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as

Environmental Law as of the Effective Time. Except as would not reasonably be
expected to have, in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, no

reasonable efforts to maintain in effect all existing governmental permits
pursuant to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries operate.

        (s) TAKEOVER LAWS. Neither party shall take any action that would cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law, and each of them shall take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the

validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter
in effect, including Section 912 of the NYBCL.

        (v) PRIMARY BUSINESSES. Parent shall not engage in or enter into, or
agree to engage in or enter into, any transaction that would cause Parent to
become not primarily engaged in the gas and electric utilities businesses.

        (w) CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. Parent shall not engage in or enter into, or
agree to engage in or enter into, any acquisition or disposition of assets or
securities that would delay, or would reasonably be expected to delay, the
consummation of the Merger, including any such delay resulting from any
amendment or modification of a Parent Required Statutory Approval.

        Section 6.2. COVENANT OF THE COMPANY; ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS. From and
after the date hereof, the Company agrees (a) that it will not, its subsidiaries
will not, and it will not authorize or permit any of its or its subsidiaries'
officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (including, without
limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any
of its subsidiaries or any of the foregoing) to, directly or indirectly,
encourage, initiate or solicit (including by way of furnishing information) or
take any other action to facilitate knowingly any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer (including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its
shareholders) which constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Alternative Proposal (as defined below) from any person or engage in any
discussion or negotiations concerning, or provide any non-public information or
data to make or implement, an Alternative Proposal; (b) that it will immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation, initiation,
encouragement, activity, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with a view of formulating an Alternative Proposal; and (c) that it
will notify Parent orally and in writing of any such inquiry, offer or proposals
(including, without limitation, the terms and conditions of any such proposal

thereof, and that it shall keep


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

Parent informed of the status and details of any such inquiry, offer or proposal
and shall give Parent 48 hours' prior notice of any confidentiality or similar
agreement to be entered into or of the fact that it proposes to commence
providing information to any person making such inquiry, offer or proposal;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Company
may (i) at any time prior to the time at which the Company Shareholders'
Approval shall have been obtained engage in discussions or negotiations with a
third party who (without any solicitation, initiation, encouragement, discussion
or negotiation, directly or indirectly, by or with the Company or its
representatives after the date hereof) seeks to initiate such discussions or
negotiations and may furnish such third party information concerning the Company
and its business, properties and assets if, and only to the extent that, (A) (x)
the third party has first made an Alternative Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith is financially superior to the
Merger and has demonstrated that any necessary financing has been obtained, or
in the reasonable judgment of the Company's financial advisor is obtainable, and
(y) the Board of Directors of the Company shall conclude in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel and consideration of
such other matters as the Board of Directors of the Company deems relevant, that
failure to do so would likely result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law, and (B) prior to furnishing such information to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations with, such person or entity, the Company
receives from such person an executed confidentiality agreement in reasonably
customary form except that such confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit
such person from making an unsolicited Alternative Proposal, and (ii) comply
with Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a tender or
exchange offer and/or (iii) accept an Alternative Proposal from a third party,
provided the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f).
"ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL" shall mean any merger, acquisition, consolidation,
reorganization, share exchange, tender offer, exchange offer or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries, or any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, a
substantial equity interest in or a substantial portion of the assets of the
Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall prohibit an
acquisition permitted by Section 6.1(e) hereof or a disposition permitted by
Section 6.1(g) hereof.

         Section 6.3. EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT. Parent, the Company and Mr. Richards
have entered into an employment agreement in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT

                                  ARTICLE VII

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS
                              ---------------------

         Section 7.1. ACCESS TO INFORMATION. (a) Upon reasonable notice and
during normal business hours, each party shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries
to, afford to the officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel,
investment bankers, financial advisors and other representatives of the other
(collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES") reasonable access, throughout the period prior
to the Effective Time, to all of its properties, books, contracts, commitments
and records (including, but not limited to, Tax Returns) and, during such
period, each party shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, furnish promptly
to the other (i) access to each report, schedule


                                      -33-
<PAGE>

and other document filed or received by it or any of its subsidiaries pursuant
to the requirements of federal or state securities laws or filed with or sent to
the SEC, the FERC, the NRC, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade
Commission or any other federal or state regulatory agency or commission, and
(ii) access to all information concerning themselves, their subsidiaries,
directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
requested by the other party in connection with any filings, applications or
approvals required or contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall, and
shall cause its subsidiaries and Representatives to, hold in strict confidence
all Proprietary Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
concerning the other parties furnished to it in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of September 8, 2000, between the Company and Parent, as it may be
amended from time to time (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT").

        (b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, each party
(the "INSPECTED PARTY") shall (i) permit the other party and its authorized
representatives to conduct such Phase I environmental inspections as the other
party may reasonably require and (ii) without limiting any representation made
in Section 4.11 hereof, cause its officers and those of its subsidiaries to
furnish the other party with such information in existence as the other party
may from time to time reasonably request, including, without limitation,
assessments, reports, audits, studies and data concerning the existence of
Hazardous Materials at facilities or properties presently or formerly owned,
operated, leased or used by the Inspected Party or any present or former
subsidiary, or concerning compliance by the Inspected Party and its subsidiaries
with, or liability under, any Environmental Laws.

        Section 7.2. JOINT PROXY STATEMENT AND REGISTRATION STATEMENT.

       (a) PREPARATION AND FILING. The parties will prepare and file with the
SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof the Registration
Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement (together, the "JOINT PROXY/REGISTRATION
STATEMENT"). The parties hereto shall each use reasonable efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing. Each party hereto shall also take
such action as may be reasonably required to cause the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger to be registered or to obtain an
exemption from registration under applicable state "blue sky" or securities
laws; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no party shall be required to register or qualify
as a foreign corporation or to take other action which would subject it to
service of process in any jurisdiction where it will not be, following the
Merger, so subject. Each of the parties hereto shall furnish all information
concerning itself which is required or customary for inclusion in the Joint
Proxy/Registration Statement. The parties shall use reasonable efforts to cause
the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger to be
approved for listing on the NYSE upon official notice of issuance. The
information provided by any party hereto for use in the Joint Proxy/Registration
Statement shall be true and correct in all material respects without omission of
any material fact which is required to make such information not false or
misleading. No representation, covenant or agreement is made by or on behalf of
any party hereto with respect to information supplied by any other party for
inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Registration Statement.

         (b) LETTER OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTANT. Following receipt by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent auditor, of an appropriate
request from the Company pursuant to SAS No. 72, the Company shall use its best
efforts to cause to be delivered to Parent a letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP dated a date within two business days before the date of the Joint
Proxy/Registration Statement, and addressed to Parent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and customary in scope and substance for "cold
comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements similar to the Joint Proxy/Registration Statement.

         (c) LETTER OF PARENT'S ACCOUNTANT. Following receipt by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, Parent's independent auditor, of an appropriate
request from Parent pursuant to SAS No. 72, Parent shall use its best efforts to
cause to be delivered to the Company a letter of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP,
dated a date within two business days before the date of the Joint
Proxy/Registration Statement, and addressed to the Company, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and customary in scope and
substance for "cold comfort" letters delivered by independent public accountants
in connection with registration statements similar to the Joint
Proxy/Registration Statement.

         Section 7.3. FURTHER ASSURANCES; REGULATORY MATTERS. (a) Subject to
Section 8.2(h), each party hereto shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to,
cooperate and use its best efforts to (i) promptly prepare and file with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities all necessary reports, applications,
petitions, forms, notices or other applicable documents required or advisable
with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) comply, at the earliest practicable date following the date of
receipt by Parent or the Company, with any request for information or documents
from a Governmental Authority related to, and appropriate in the light of,
matters within the jurisdiction of such Governmental Authority, provided that
(x) the parties shall use their best efforts to keep any such information
confidential to the extent required by the party providing the information and
(y) each party may take, in its reasonable discretion, appropriate legal action
not to provide information relating to trade or business secrets, privileged
information or other information which reasonably should be treated as
confidential, (iii) take all actions necessary or advisable to obtain no later
than the Initial Termination Date, as such date may be extended pursuant to
Section 9.1(b), all necessary permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the Company Required Statutory Approvals and Parent Required
Statutory Approvals) and (iv) oppose vigorously any litigation that would impede
or delay the consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, promptly
appealing any adverse court order.

         (b) Each party will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, execute such
further documents and instruments and take such further actions as may
reasonably be requested by any other party in order to consummate the Merger in
accordance with the terms hereof. The parties expressly acknowledge and agree
that, although it is their current intention to effect a business combination
between themselves in the form contemplated by this Agreement, it may be
preferable to effectuate such a business combination by means of an alternative
structure in light of the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(e) or 8.2(h).
Accordingly, if the only conditions to the


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

parties' obligations to consummate the Merger which are not satisfied or waived
are receipt of any one or more of the Company Required Statutory Approvals or
Parent Required Statutory Approvals and the adoption of an alternative structure
(that otherwise substantially preserves for Parent and the Company the economic
benefits of the Merger and does not require any additional filing with or
authorization, consent or approval from any Governmental Authority, other than
supplements or amendments to filings already made, to reflect such alternative
structure) would result in such conditions being satisfied or waived, then the
parties shall use their respective best efforts to effect a business combination
among themselves by means of a mutually agreed upon structure other than the
Merger that so preserves such benefits; PROVIDED that, prior to closing any such
restructured transaction, all material third party and Governmental Authority
declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents or
approvals necessary for the effectuation of such alternative business
combination shall have been obtained and all other conditions to the parties'
obligations to consummate the Merger, as applied to such alternative business
combination, shall have been satisfied or waived.

         (c) Parent and the Company shall together discuss and formulate the
approach to be taken with the New York State Public Service Commission (the
"PSC") with respect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Mr. Richards shall have the primary
responsibility for coordinating strategy and communications with the PSC, and no
contacts with the PSC relating to the Merger shall be made by any party without
prior notice to and consultation with the other party, except in accordance with
procedures mutually agreed upon by the parties in connection with ordinary
course requests for information made by the PSC.

         Section 7.4. SHAREHOLDERS' APPROVAL.

         (a) COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING. Subject to the provisions of Section

purpose of securing the Company Shareholders' Approval, (ii) distribute to its
shareholders the Joint Proxy Statement in accordance with applicable federal and
state law and with its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, (iii) subject
to the fiduciary duties of its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders
the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv)
cooperate and consult with Parent with respect to each of the foregoing matters.

         (b) PARENT SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING. Subject to the provisions of Section

of securing Parent Shareholders' Approval, (ii) distribute to its shareholders
the Joint Proxy Statement in accordance with applicable federal and state law
and with its certificate of incorporation and by-laws, (iii) subject to the
fiduciary duties of its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders the

Merger and (iv) cooperate and consult with Company with respect to each of the
foregoing matters.

<PAGE>


         (c) MEETING DATE. The Company Shareholders' Meeting for the purpose of
securing the Company Shareholders' Approval and Parent Shareholders' Meeting for
the purpose of securing Parent Shareholders' Approval shall be held on the same
date, which shall be such date as the Company and Parent shall mutually
determine. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold the Company
Shareholders' Meeting, and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to hold
Parent Shareholders' Meeting, simultaneously with the Company's and Parent's
2001 annual meetings, respectively, or otherwise, as promptly as practicable
after the date hereof.

          Section 7.5. DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a) INDEMNIFICATION. To the extent, if any, not provided by an existing
right of indemnification or other agreement or policy, from and after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, an officer, director or employee of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries (each an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and
collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against (i) all losses, expenses
(including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses), claims, damages or
liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next succeeding sentence, amounts
paid in settlement, arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time) that are, in whole or in part, based on or arising out of the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company
or a subsidiary of the Company (the "INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"), and (ii) all
Indemnified Liabilities to the extent they are based on or arise out of or
pertain to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of any
such loss, expense, claim, damage or liability (whether or not arising before
the Effective Time), (i) Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, promptly after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred, (ii) any determination required to be
made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party's conduct complies with the
standards set forth in Section 722 of the NYBCL, and the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws, shall be made by independent counsel mutually
acceptable to Parent and the Indemnified Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). The Indemnified Parties as a
group may retain only one law firm with respect to each related matter except to
the extent there is, in the opinion of counsel to an Indemnified Party, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant
issue between positions of such Indemnified Party and any other Indemnified
Party or Indemnified Parties.

         (b) INSURANCE. For a period of six years after the Effective Time,
Parent shall (i) cause to be maintained in effect policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance for the benefit of those persons who are currently
covered by such policies of the Company on terms no less favorable than the
terms of such current insurance coverage or (ii) provide tail coverage for such
persons which provides coverage for a period of six years for acts prior to the
Effective Time on terms no less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent shall not be required to
expend in any year an amount in excess of 200% of


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

the annual aggregate premiums currently paid by the Company, for such insurance;
and provided, further, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage
exceed such amount, Parent shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the best
coverage available, in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of
Parent, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

        (c) SUCCESSORS. In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in either such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 7.5.

        (d) SURVIVAL OF INDEMNIFICATION. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
from and after the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification as of the date
hereof in favor of the employees, agents, directors and officers of the Company,
and its subsidiaries with respect to their activities as such prior to the
Effective Time, as provided in its respective certificate of incorporation and
by-laws in effect on the date hereof, or otherwise in effect on the date hereof,
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of not less than six years from the Effective Time.

        (e) BENEFIT. The provisions of this Section 7.5 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives.

        Section 7.6. DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES. On the date hereof, (a) Parent has
delivered to the Company a schedule (the "PARENT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"),
accompanied by a certificate signed by the Executive Vice President, General
Counsel and Secretary of Parent stating the Parent Disclosure Schedule is being
delivered pursuant to this Section 7.6(a), and (b) the Company has delivered to
Parent a schedule (the "COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE"), accompanied by a
certificate signed by the Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the
Company stating the Company Disclosure Schedule is being delivered pursuant to
this Section 7.6(b). The Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure
Schedule are collectively referred to herein as the "DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES." The
Disclosure Schedules constitute an integral part of this Agreement and modify
the respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties hereto contained herein to the extent that such representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements expressly refer to the Disclosure Schedules.
Anything to the contrary contained herein or in the Disclosure Schedules
notwithstanding, any and all statements, representations, warranties or
disclosures set forth in the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to have been
made on and as of the date hereof.

        Section 7.7. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Subject to each party's disclosure
obligations imposed by law, the Company and Parent will cooperate with each
other in the development and distribution of all news releases and other public
information disclosures with respect to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any public announcement or
statement with respect hereto without the consent of the other party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

         Section 7.8. RULE 145 AFFILIATES. Within 30 days after the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall identify in a letter to Parent all persons who are,
and to such person's best knowledge who will be at the Closing Date,
"affiliates" of the Company, as such term is used in Rule 145 under the
Securities Act. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to cause its
affiliates (including any person who may be deemed to have become an affiliate
after the date of the letter referred to in the prior sentence) to deliver to
Parent on or prior to the Closing Date a written letter substantially in the
form attached as EXHIBIT B (each, an "AFFILIATE LETTER").

         Section 7.9. CERTAIN EMPLOYEE AGREEMENTS. Subject to Section 7.10,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries shall honor all
contracts, agreements and commitments of the parties which apply to any current
or former employee or current or former director of the parties hereto;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing shall not prevent Parent or the Surviving
Corporation from enforcing, amending or terminating such contracts, agreements
and commitments in accordance with their terms, including, without limitation,
any reserved right to amend, modify, suspend, revoke or terminate any such
contract, agreement or commitment. It is the present intention of Parent and the
Company that following the Effective Time, there will be no involuntary
reductions in workforce at the Surviving Corporation or its subsidiaries, but
that Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective subsidiaries will
continue Parent's and the Company's present strategy of achieving workforce
reductions through attrition; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any reductions in
workforce in respect of employees of the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries become necessary, any such reduction shall be made in consultation
with the Chairman of the Surviving Corporation and shall be made on a fair and
equitable basis, in light of the circumstances and the objectives to be
achieved, giving consideration to previous work history, job experience,
qualifications, and business needs without regard to whether employment prior to
the Effective Time was with the Company or its subsidiaries or Parent or its
subsidiaries; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that to the extent that any such workforce
reduction would affect employees of Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation
disproportionately, in the aggregate, as compared with employees of New York
State Electric & Gas Corporation as a result of provisions of a collective
bargaining agreement applicable to such employees of New York State Electric &
Gas Corporation, each employee of Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation shall
be protected with respect to such workforce reduction to the same extent that a
similarly situated employee of New York State Electric & Gas Corporation is
protected with respect to such workforce reduction by such provisions of the
collective bargaining agreement. Any employees whose employment is terminated or
jobs are eliminated by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate on a fair and equitable
basis in the job opportunity and employment placement programs offered by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries. Any
workforce reductions carried out following the Effective Time by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and their respective subsidiaries shall be done in
accordance with all laws and regulations governing the employment relationship
and termination thereof including, without limitation, the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any
comparable state or local law.

         Section 7.10 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

         (a) CONTINUATION OF BENEFITS. Except as contemplated by this Agreement,
for a period of 18 months following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall continue to maintain the Employee Benefit Plans or shall
maintain replacement employee benefit plans and arrangements which shall provide
a level of benefits to active and retired employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided under the
Employee Benefit Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that changes may be made to the Employee Benefit Plans or
such replacement employee benefit plans and arrangements to the extent necessary
to comply with applicable law.

         (b) SERVICE RECOGNITION. To the extent that service is relevant for
purposes of eligibility, participation, vesting or benefit accrual (other than
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plans) under any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement established, maintained or contributed to
by the Surviving Corporation and Parent, employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries shall be credited for service accrued or deemed accrued prior to
the Effective Time with the Company or a subsidiary of the Company; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that such crediting of service does not result in the duplication of
benefits or an unintended windfall with respect to the accrual of benefits. The
Surviving Corporation shall provide each employee of the Company and its
subsidiaries with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time for the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under any
welfare plans that such employees are eligible to participate in after the
