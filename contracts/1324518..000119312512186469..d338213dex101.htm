Contributor shall prepare and deliver to Acquirer: (i) Contributors good
faith estimated balance sheet of the Company as of 11:59 p.m. local time on

Amount (the " _Final Indebtedness Amount_ "); and (v) Acquirers calculation

13  Sheet, the Final Net Working Capital, the Final Pre-Closing Capital
Expenditures Amount, the Final Indebtedness Amount and the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount shall be prepared and/or calculated in accordance
with GAAP applied consistently and in a manner consistent with the Accounting
Methodology Schedule. In connection with Contributors review of the Final
Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Final Pre-Closing Capital Expenditures
Schedule and the calculation of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount,
Acquirer shall, and shall cause the Company to, (x) permit Contributor and its
Representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and other
documents (including internal work papers, schedules, financial statements and
memoranda) of the Company, shall cooperate with Contributor and its
Representatives in seeking to obtain work papers from Acquirer and the Company
pertaining to the calculation of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount
and provide Contributor with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by
Contributor) and (y) provide Contributor and its Representatives reasonable
access to Acquirers and the Companys employees and accountants as
reasonably requested by Contributor.

(e) Unless Contributor delivers to Acquirer written notice setting forth in
reasonable detail any specific items in Acquirers calculation of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount disputed by Contributor (each, a " _Disputed
Item_ ") and a written statement setting forth Contributors calculation of
each such Disputed Item on or prior to the sixtieth (60th) day after
Contributors receipt of the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Final
Pre-Closing Capital Expenditures Schedule (such period, the " _Objection
Period_ "), Contributor will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to
Acquirers calculation of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount and such
agreement will be final, binding and conclusive. Any items in Acquirers
calculation of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount to which Contributor
has not given notice of objection within the Objection Period will be deemed
to have been agreed upon by the Parties. If Contributor so notifies Acquirer
of its objections to Acquirers calculation of the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount within the Objection Period, Acquirer and Contributor shall,
within thirty (30) days following such notice (the " _Resolution Period_ "),
attempt to resolve the Disputed Items. Any resolution by Acquirer and
Contributor during the Resolution Period as to any Disputed Items will be
final, binding and conclusive.

 

(f) If Acquirer and Contributor do not resolve all Disputed Items by the end
of the Resolution Period, then Acquirer and Contributor shall submit all
unresolved Disputed Items to KPMG LLP or such other national independent
accounting firm mutually acceptable to Acquirer and Contributor (the "
_Independent Accounting Firm_ ") as soon as practicable following the
expiration of the Resolution Period. In such event, each of Acquirer and
Contributor shall submit to the Independent Accounting Firm its calculation of
the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount together with such supporting
documentation as it deems appropriate. The Independent Accounting Firm will
resolve such dispute by choosing in its entirety the calculation of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount proposed by either Acquirer or Contributor
and will make no other resolution of such dispute (including by combining
elements of either calculation of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount
submitted by Acquirer and Contributor). Acquirer and Contributor shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after the date
on which the Independent Accounting Firm receives the calculations of the
Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount submitted by Acquirer and Contributor.
The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and

 



14  binding upon the Parties and shall not be subject to appeal or further
review absent manifest error. The costs and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm will be paid by the Party whose calculation of the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount is not chosen by the Independent Accounting
Firm in its resolution of the dispute. The Parties agree that the procedures
set forth in this _Section 2.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive method for
resolving disputes regarding the determination of the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount.

(g) Within five (5) Business Days after the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Amount is finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.3_:

 

(i) if the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount, Acquirer shall promptly deliver to Contributor, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by
Contributor, an amount equal to such excess;

 

(ii) if the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.3_, Contributor shall promptly deliver to Acquirer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account designated by Acquirer,
an amount equal to such excess; and

 

(iii) if the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Amount as finally determined
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ is equal to the Estimated Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount, neither Acquirer nor Contributor shall have any further
obligation under this _Section 2.3_.

Section 2.4 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

The purchase and sale of the Purchased Interests shall be treated for federal
and applicable state income Tax purposes as the sale and purchase of the
assets of the Company, and no Party or any Affiliate thereof shall take any
position inconsistent with such treatment. Contributor and Acquirer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to agree to an allocation of the Final
Purchase Price, liabilities of the Company, and any other items constituting
consideration for applicable income Tax purposes among the assets of the
Company that complies with _Schedule 2.4_ and Section 1060 of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder within ninety (90) days after
the Closing Date (the " _Allocation_ "). The Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to update the Allocation in a manner consistent with
_Schedule 2.4_ and Section 1060 of the Code following any adjustment to the
Final Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement. Contributor and Acquirer
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, report consistently with the
Allocation, as adjusted, in all Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594 if
required, and neither Contributor nor Acquirer shall take any position in
any Tax Return that is inconsistent with the Allocation, as adjusted, in each
case, unless required to do so by a final determination as defined in Section
1313 of the Code. Each of Contributor and Acquirer agree to promptly advise
each other regarding the existence of any Tax audit, controversy or
litigation related to the Allocation.

 



15 Section 2.5 _Tax Treatment of Contribution_.

 

The Parties intend that (i) the contribution and assignment of the Purchased
Interests by Contributor to Acquirer shall be treated as a contribution by
Contributor to Acquirer of the assets of the Company in exchange for the
Equity Interests in a transaction consistent with the requirements of Section
721(a) of the Code; (ii) Acquirer shall be treated as assuming the liabilities
of Contributor or taking the assets of Contributor subject to the liabilities
of Contributor; and (iii) to the greatest extent permissible under Section
1.707-4(d), the distribution of the Cash Consideration shall be treated as a
distribution to Contributor by Acquirer under Section 731 of the Code and be
treated as a reimbursement of capital expenditures. Unless otherwise required
by a change in applicable Law, the Parties agree to file all Tax Returns and
otherwise act at all times in a manner consistent with this intended
treatment set forth in this _Section 2.5_, including disclosing the
distribution of the Cash Consideration in accordance with the requirements of
Section 1.707-3(c)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.

not with a view to distribution in violation of the Securities Act or any
applicable state securities or blue sky laws. Contributor is an accredited
investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act. Contributor understands that the Equity Consideration has not
been, and will not be (other than as expressly set forth in the Registration
Rights Agreement), registered under the Securities Act, by reason of a

which depends upon, among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment
intent and the accuracy of Contributors representations as expressed herein.
Contributor acknowledges that the Equity Consideration constitutes
"restricted securities" under applicable U.S. federal and state securities
Laws and that, pursuant to these Laws, Contributor must hold the Equity
Consideration indefinitely unless they are registered with the SEC and
qualified by state Governmental Authority, or an exemption from such
registration and qualification requirements is available. Contributor further
acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or qualification is
available, it may be conditioned on various requirements including the time
and manner of sale, the holding period for the Equity Consideration, and on
requirements relating to Acquirer which are outside of Acquirers control, and
which Acquirer may not be able to satisfy. Contributor understands that the
Equity Consideration and any securities issued in respect of or exchange
therefor, shall bear one or all of the following legends: (a) a legend
describing the restrictions relating to the Equity Consideration contained in
this Agreement; (b) the legends contemplated by the Registration Rights
Agreement; and (c) any legend required by the securities Laws of any state to
the extent such Laws are applicable to the Equity Consideration represented
by the certificate so legended; _provided that_ , each such legend shall be
removed (i) at such time as such restrictions are no longer applicable, which
removal shall be completed within three (3) Business Days after the request
of the holder of the Equity Consideration, and (ii) with respect to the
restriction described in _clause (c)_ above, upon delivery of a customary
opinion of counsel to such holder, which opinion is reasonably satisfactory
in form and substance to Acquirer and its counsel, that the

 



32  restriction referenced in such legend is no longer required in order to
ensure compliance with applicable securities Laws, which removal shall be
completed within three (3) Business Days after delivery of such opinion of
counsel that is so reasonably satisfactory.

Section 3.24 _Investigation; No Other Representations_.

(a) Contributor acknowledges and agrees that the representations and
warranties of Acquirer set forth in the Transaction Documents constitute the
sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Acquirer in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby. There are no representations,
warranties, covenants, understandings or agreements of Acquirer regarding
Acquirer or the Equity Consideration other than those set forth in the
Transaction Documents. Except for the representations and warranties of
Acquirer expressly set forth in the Transaction Documents,
Contributor disclaims reliance on any representations or warranties, either
express or implied, by Acquirer, and Contributor acknowledges and agrees that
no material or information provided by or communications made by Acquirer or

businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial
conditions, technologies and prospects of Acquirer. CONTRIBUTOR FURTHER

SHALL HAVE NO RECOURSE WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACH OF SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN _SECTION 8.2_.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF CONTRIBUTOR EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR IN ANY OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, (i) CONTRIBUTOR EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE LIABILITIES, OPERATIONS, TITLE, CONDITION, VALUE

DOCUMENT AND TO SEEK REMEDY FOR SUCH BREACH PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR SUCH TRANSACTION DOCUMENT, AS APPLICABLE.

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 3.24_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall limit, restrict or otherwise impair Contributors rights as a unitholder
in Acquirer after the Closing, including rights arising out of any
inaccuracies in the applicable registration statements, proxy statements, and
other statements, reports, schedules, forms and other documents filed by

partnership power required to carry on its business as now conducted. Acquirer

limited partnership action on the part of Acquirer.

 



34 (b) This Agreement has been duly and validly executed by Acquirer, and each of
the other Transaction Documents will be duly and validly executed by
Acquirer, and (assuming this Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of
Contributor) this Agreement constitutes, and each of the other Transaction
Documents entered into or to be entered at the Closing by it will constitute
when entered into, a valid and binding agreement of Acquirer (assuming such
Transaction Document is a valid and binding obligation of Contributor),
enforceable against Acquirer in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by Creditors Rights.

Section 4.3 _No Conflicts; Consents and Approvals_.

The execution, delivery and performance by Acquirer of this Agreement and the

C.F.R. Part 800, _et. seq._ ).

Section 5.2 _Access to Information_.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Contributor shall
give Acquirer and its Representatives reasonable access to the offices,
personnel, properties and books and records (including work papers and data in
possession of the Companys Representatives) of the Company. Any
investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.2(a)_ shall (i) be conducted at
Acquirers sole expense, during normal business hours and in such manner so as
not to interfere with the conduct of the business of Contributor and the
Company and, to the extent so requested by Contributor, under the supervision
of a Representative of Contributor or the Company and (ii) not be conducted
without reasonable prior notice to, and approval (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of, Contributor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquirer shall not: (x) have access to
personnel records of Contributor or the Company relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information
which in Contributors good faith determination is sensitive or the disclosure
of which could subject Contributor, the Company or any of their Affiliates to
risk of liability (unless such information is sufficiently redacted in order
to allow such disclosure) without prior written consent of Contributor (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); (y)
conduct any invasive sampling or testing of any soil, surface water,

 



42  groundwater, building materials or other environmental media, including the
conduct of a Phase II environmental site assessment; or (z) have access to any
information if doing so would reasonably likely constitute a breach by
Contributor, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates of any Contract
to which such Person is a party or would reasonably likely constitute a
violation of any Law to which Contributor, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates is subject ( _provided that_ , in each such case
Contributor shall, and shall cause the Company and the applicable Affiliates
to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide Acquirer with access to
such information while avoiding a breach of any such Contract or a violation
of any such Law, including seeking applicable waivers or consents or redacting
certain information from documents), or which such Person believes in good
faith could jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege.

(b) Neither Contributor nor any of its Representatives makes any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information provided
pursuant to this _Section 5.2_, and Acquirer may not rely on the accuracy of
any such information, in each case, other than as expressly set forth in the
representations and warranties contained in the Transaction Documents. All
information provided or made available to Acquirer or any of its
Representatives will be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
January 5, 2012, between Contributor and Williams Field Services Group LLC
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which agreement shall remain in full
force and effect until the Closing and shall thereupon terminate except that
the disclosure (but not the use to the extent necessary to operate the
business of the Company in the ordinary course) of any Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to the extent
related solely to Contributor or its Affiliates (for the avoidance of
doubt, other than the Company) shall continue to be governed by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

(c) After the Closing, Contributor and its Affiliates will hold, and will use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause their respective
Representatives to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by
applicable Law, all confidential documents and information concerning the
Company and the business thereof, except to the extent that such information
can be shown to have been (i) previously known on a nonconfidential basis by
Contributor, (ii) in the public domain through no fault of Contributor or its
Affiliates or (iii) later lawfully acquired by Contributor from sources other
than those related to its prior ownership of the Company. The obligation of
Contributor and its Affiliates to hold any such information in confidence
shall be satisfied if they exercise the same care with respect to such
information as they would take to preserve the confidentiality of their own
similar information.

(d) After the Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Contributor and
Acquirer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other and their
Representatives access, during normal business hours, to such information,
the Books and Records and assistance relating to the business of the Company
as is necessary for any reasonable business purposes, including the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return, the defense of any Tax claim or
assessment, in connection with the prosecution or defense of any
investigation, claim (including any insurance claims) or legal proceeding
against or governmental investigations of Contributor, Acquirer, the Company
or any of their Affiliates (other than a legal proceeding among the Parties
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents) or in order to enable Contributor or Acquirer to comply
with their respective 

 



43  obligations under this Agreement. Each Party shall reimburse the other for
reasonable documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in assisting
such requesting Party pursuant to this  _Section 5.2(c)_.

(e) Acquirer shall, and shall cause the Company to preserve and keep the
books, records, documents, instruments, accounts, correspondence, writings,
evidences of title and other papers and electronic files relating to the
business of the Company (the " _Books and Records_ ") in its possession or the
possession of the Company for at least seven (7) years following the Closing
Date or for such longer period as may be required by applicable Law; _provided
that_ , Contributor may dispose of or destroy any such Books and Records for
which Contributor has offered to turn over possession thereof to Acquirer by
written notice to Acquirer at least ninety (90) days prior to the proposed
date of such disposition or destruction. Contributor shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, preserve and keep the Books and Records in its or their
possession for at least seven (7) years following the Closing Date or for such
longer period as may be required by applicable Law; _provided that_ , Acquirer
may dispose of or destroy any such Books and Records for which Acquirer has
offered to turn over possession thereof to Contributor by written notice to
Contributor at least ninety (90) days prior to the proposed date of such
disposition or destruction.

 

Section 5.3 _Resignation of Officers and Managers_.

satisfactory to Acquirer of the resignation, effective as of the Closing, of
any managers and officers of the Company as requested by Acquirer at least

Section 5.4 _Use of Contributor s Names and Marks_.

 

(a) Acquirer agrees that (i) as soon as practicable following the Closing, but

cause the Company to, change the name of the Company to a name that does not
include any of Contributors Names and Marks or comprise any colorable
imitations thereof; and (ii) as soon as practicable following the Closing,
but in no event later than one hundred eighty (180) days after Closing,
Acquirer shall, and shall cause the Company to, cease and permanently
discontinue any and all uses of any of the Contributors Names and Marks and
any colorable imitations thereof, and remove or cover all Contributors Names
and Marks from, or destroy, any publications, signage, corporate letterhead,
invoices, stationery, business cards, marketing materials, website content or
other materials in the Companys possession or under its control bearing any
of the Contributors Names and Marks, and provide Contributor with written
confirmation thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquirer shall have a
period of up to twelve (12) months from the Closing to cause the Company to
permanently remove Contributors Names and Marks on pipeline markers or
similar assets of the Company.

(b) In no event shall Acquirer or any of its Affiliates use any of
Contributors Names and Marks after Closing in any manner or for any purpose
different from the use of such Contributors Names and Marks by the Company
preceding the Closing, and neither Acquirer

 



44  nor any of its Affiliates shall affix any of the Contributors Names and
Marks or any colorable imitations thereof on any publications, signage,
corporate letterhead, invoices, stationery, business cards, marketing
materials, website content or other materials that are created or produced
after the Closing. Acquirer, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that, after
the Closing Date, Acquirer and its Affiliates will not do business
or represent themselves as having any affiliation or business relationship
with Contributor or any of its subsidiaries, except pursuant to any separate
agreement entered into, or assumed by, Acquirer or its Affiliates on one hand,
and Contributor or its Affiliates, on the other hand.

(c) Acquirer expressly acknowledges and confirms that Contributor is not
transferring or assigning, and Acquirer shall not receive, any right, title
or interest in or to Contributors Names and Marks, except the limited right
to use Contributors Names and Marks for the sole purpose of permitting
Acquirer to complete the phase-out of such use in strict compliance with this
_Section 5.4_. Acquirer expressly acknowledges and confirms that Contributor
is not transferring or assigning, and Acquirer shall not receive, any right,
title or interest in or to Contributors Names and Marks (except the limited
right to use for the sole purpose of permitting Acquirer to complete the
phase-out in strict compliance with this _Section 5.4_). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein or in the other Transaction Documents, prior
to the Closing Date, Contributor shall be permitted to cause the Company to
assign and transfer to Contributor or its Affiliates (other than the Company)
any and all right, title and interest that the Company has or may have in or
to Contributors Names and Marks, including any goodwill therein. Furthermore,
all use of Contributors Names and Marks by Acquirer during the phase-out
period described in _Section 5.4(a)_ shall be at all times subject to
Contributors direction and control, Acquirer shall, and shall cause the
Company to, comply with Contributors instructions and direction at all times
and any and all use thereof by Acquirer or the Company shall inure to the
exclusive benefit of Contributor.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.4_, Acquirer and the
Company may continue to use the Contributors Names and Marks for so long as
is reasonably necessary (but in no event longer than thirty (30) months
following the Closing) to maintain the Permits of the Company or to avoid
unreasonable delays with respect to Permits. Acquirer agrees to and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Contributor against any liabilities, obligations
or losses which Contributor may incur as a result of such use by Acquirer of
Contributors Names and Marks. Furthermore, Acquirer will use commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Permits reissued in the new name as soon as
possible following the Closing.

Section 5.5 _Efforts; Further Assurances_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party will
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary or desirable under applicable
Law to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Parties agree, and Contributor, prior to the Closing, and Acquirer, after the
Closing, agree to cause the Company, to execute and deliver such other
documents, certificates, agreements and other writings and to take such other
actions as may be necessary or desirable in order to consummate or implement
expeditiously the transactions

 



45  contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof.
Contributor shall transfer, assign, convey and deliver the properties, assets
and rights set forth on  _Schedule 5.5(i)_ to the Company on or prior to the
Closing. If, at any time following the date of this Agreement, either Party
discovers that Contributor or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company
and EnCap Energy Infrastructure Fund, L.P.) has ownership or possession of
any property, asset or right used in connection with the operation of the
Company, then Contributor shall effect the transfer, assignment, conveyance
and delivery of such property, asset or right to the Company as soon as
reasonably practicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquirer acknowledges
to Contributor that none of the assets described or set forth on _Schedule
5.5(ii)_ shall be transferred to the Company.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Acquirer
and Contributor shall: (i) use reasonable best efforts to obtain, or in the
case of Contributor, cause the Company to obtain, all necessary consents,
waivers, authorizations and approvals of all Governmental Authorities, and of
all other Persons, required in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement; and (ii) make an appropriate filing of a
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable and in any event within ten (10) days after the date of this
Agreement and shall supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act. Each of Acquirer and Contributor shall request expedited
treatment of any such filings, shall promptly furnish each other with copies
of any notices, correspondence or other written communication from the
relevant Governmental Authority, shall promptly make any appropriate
or necessary subsequent or supplemental filings and shall cooperate in the
preparation of such filings as is reasonably necessary and appropriate;
_provided that_ , neither Acquirer nor Contributor shall be required to, in
the absence of a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement, waive the

information from being disclosed to Third Parties. Each of Acquirer and
Contributor further agree to consult and cooperate with the other Party with
respect to, and to permit, to the extent reasonably practicable, the other
Party to be present at conferences and meetings for the purpose of obtaining,
clearance under the HSR Act.

 

(c) Each of Acquirer and Contributor shall cooperate in good faith with all
Governmental Authorities and shall not take any action that could reasonably
be expected to adversely affect or delay receiving any approval, clearance or
expiration of any applicable waiting period to be obtained from any
Governmental Authority charged with enforcing, applying, administering,
or investigating any applicable Law designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization, restraining
trade or abusing a dominant position (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "),
including the United States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division
of the United States Department of Justice, any attorney general of a state of
the United States or any other competition authority of any jurisdiction
(each, an " _Antitrust Authority_ "). In the event that any action is
threatened or instituted challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Acquirer and Contributor
shall use reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary to promptly
resolve such challenges. In the event that any permanent or preliminary
injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be
entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unlawful or that would

 



46  restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Acquirer shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly take all steps necessary to vacate,
modify or suspend such injunction or order as promptly as practicable and in
any event prior to the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, none of Acquirer, Contributor or any of their respective Affiliates
shall have any obligation to (i) hold separate or divest any their respective
properties or assets, (ii) defend against any lawsuit, action or proceeding,
judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, or (iii) expend a material amount of funds, in each case
in connection with its compliance with this _Section 5.5_.

Prior to and with respect to the Closing, Acquirer and Contributor agree to
consult with each other before issuing any press release or making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and, except for any press releases and public announcements

with any national securities exchange where such prior consultation is not
reasonably practicable, will not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation.

Section 5.7 _Surety Bonds_. 

As soon as practicable after the Closing, Acquirer will use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain Contributors and any of its Affiliates release from
any surety bonds of the Company set forth in _Schedule 5.7_ and any surety
bonds entered into by the Company after the date of this Agreement and prior
to Closing in the ordinary course consistent with past practices. From and
after the Closing, Acquirer shall, and shall cause the Company to, indemnify
Contributor and its Affiliates against, and shall hold each of them harmless
from, any and all Losses incurred or suffered by Contributor of any of its
Affiliates pursuant to or arising out of such surety bonds. Contributor shall
have no obligation to keep such surety bonds in effect from and after the
Closing.

Section 5.8 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Contributor shall
be solely responsible for all costs, expenses and liabilities under or in any
way attributable to the Client Service Agreement (whether occurring on, prior
to or after the Closing Date), including costs or liabilities in any way
attributable to: (i) current or former employees of Contributor, the Company
or their respective Affiliates, Employee Plans, COBRA rights and benefits, and
(ii) all charges, fees, expenses and other items under or in any way
attributable to the Client Service Agreement, including the fees or other
expenses charged by Co-Employer and all costs, liability and expense of
terminating the Client Service Agreement. Contributor shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly through any Person or
contractual arrangement, solicit, recruit or hire any Covered Employee for, or
offer any Covered Employee employment with, Contributor or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company).

 



47 (b) No later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date, Acquirer or one or more of its Affiliates shall offer employment to
each Employee whose names and positions are set forth on the document entitled
"Covered Employees" made available to Acquirer in the virtual data room
(the " _Covered Employees_ "), which offers shall (i) be written offers of
employment substantially consistent with the terms of this _Section 5.8_,
(ii) be on terms or conditions comparable to similarly situated employees of
Acquirer or its applicable Affiliate (with credit for all periods of
employment or service with Contributor and its Affiliates (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, service with the Co-Employer relating to Contributor and
its Affiliates) prior to the Closing Date solely for purposes of paid time
off and severance entitlement, and not for any other purpose under any
employee benefit plan or program), and such Covered Employee shall be subject
to the applicable screening and testing policies and procedures of Acquirer
or its applicable Affiliate, and (iii) otherwise be consistent with standard
terms, conditions and policies of employment of Acquirer or its applicable
Affiliates (each a " _Qualifying Offer_ "). Each Covered Employee shall have
three (3) Business Days to accept his or her Qualifying Offer, and failure to
accept such Qualifying Offer within such period shall constitute a rejection
of such Qualifying Offer. No later than five (5) Business Days before the
anticipated Closing Date, Acquirer shall inform Contributor of the identities
of those Covered Employees who have accepted Acquirers or such Affiliates
Qualifying Offer and those, if any, who have declined the Qualifying Offer.
Acquirer shall be solely responsible, and shall reimburse Contributor, for any
severance or other obligations (including the employer-paid portion of any
payroll taxes) due to a Covered Employee under the Caiman Severance Policy
(which was made available to Acquirer in the virtual data room) that arise due
to Acquirers failure to make a Qualifying Offer to such Covered Employee
(subject to _clauses (i)_ through _(iii)_ above). A Covered Employee who
signifies his or her acceptance of the Qualifying Offer, but does not report
for work as specified in the Qualifying Offer and does not otherwise satisfy
each of the terms and conditions of such Qualifying Offer, shall be
deemed not to have accepted the Qualifying Offer. Covered Employees who
accept and comply with the terms and conditions of Qualifying Offers from
Acquirer or such Affiliate are referred to herein as " _Transferred
Employees_." Employment of Transferred Employees by Acquirer or such
Affiliate shall commence (i) in the case of a Covered Employee who is actively
at work on the Closing Date, 12:00 a.m. of the day after the Closing Date, and
shall be deemed for all purposes to have occurred with no interruption or
break in service, (ii) in the case of a Covered Employee who is on approved
leave on the Closing Date, upon such Covered Employees return from leave
within ninety (90) days of Closing, shall provide Contributor with
appropriate return to work documents and Contributor will then contact
Acquirer or such Affiliate to arrange for appropriate transition of services
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Qualifying Offer, and
(iii) in the case of any Covered Employee who is not actively at work on the
Closing Date and is not on approved leave, shall be deemed not to have
accepted the qualifying offer and will remain with the Contributor.
Contributor shall be solely responsible, and shall directly provide for the
full cost of, any severance or other obligations (including the employer-paid
portion of any payroll taxes and the provision of any COBRA continuation
coverage) due to a Covered Employee that arise due to the failure of such
Covered Employee who receives a Qualifying Offer to become a Transferred
Employee (as a result of such Covered Employees rejection of the Qualifying
Offer or otherwise).

 



48 (c) All Transferred Employees shall be terminated by Contributor and its
Affiliates and shall cease active participation in the Employee Plans
effective as of 11:59 p.m. local time on the day immediately preceding the
Closing Date.

(d) In the event any Transferred Employee is terminated without cause by
Acquirer or its applicable Affiliate within twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date, such individual shall be eligible for severance benefits in
amounts and upon terms no less favorable than the more favorable of (i) the
severance benefits described in the document entitled "Caiman Severance
Benefits" made available to Acquirer in the virtual data room (taking into
account service with Acquirer and its Affiliates (including any co-employer)
from and after the Closing Date) and (ii) those afforded by the severance
plans or arrangements in which similarly-situated employees of Acquirer and
its Affiliates (including any co-employer) participate in at the time of such
termination.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 5.8_, none of Acquirer, or Acquirers
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) shall have any
liability or obligation, contingent or otherwise, arising from or relating to
(i) any employees (or any other current or former employee of Contributor or
any of its Affiliates, including, before the Closing, the Company) employment
with, or termination of employment by, Contributor or any of its Affiliates,
(ii) the Employee Plans or participation by employees (or any other current or
former employee of Contributor or any of its Affiliates, including, before the
Closing, the Company) or Transferred Employees in the Employee Plans, or
(iii) Title IV of ERISA by reason of the Company being treated as a single
employer that includes Contributor pursuant to Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code. In particular and without limiting the generality
of the foregoing sentence, except as provided in _Section 5.8(c)_,
Contributor and its Affiliates (other than the Company) shall be solely
responsible for payment of any severance and termination costs, accrued and
unpaid bonus or incentive payments with respect to performance periods ending
on or before the Closing Date, payment of any bonus or other incentive
compensation for performance periods beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date (disregarding any requirement that a participant be employed
with Contributor or any of its Affiliates on the date of such payment or
through the performance period), and/or Sections 601 _et seq._ of ERISA
(COBRA) costs) with respect to the employment or termination of employment by
Contributor or any Affiliate of Contributor of employees (or any other current
or former employee of Contributor or any of its Affiliates, including, before
the Closing, the Company), whether or not they become Transferred
Employees, that are incurred or due as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including but not limited to the termination
of any of the employees by Contributor or its Affiliates but excluding the
termination of any Transferred Employees by Acquirer and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Company). Except as otherwise provided in
this _Section 5.8_, after the Closing, Acquirer and its Affiliates shall be
solely responsible for all employment and employee benefits-related
liabilities, obligations, claims and losses that are made and payable after
the Closing, are incurred or arise after the Closing Date with respect to
employment with the Acquirer and its Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Company) after the Closing Date, and relate to any Transferred Employee
(or any dependent or beneficiary of any such Transferred Employee).

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing express or implied by this
Agreement shall (i) confer upon any Employee (or any other current or former
employee of 

 



49  Contributor or any of its Affiliates, including the Company), or
representative thereof, any rights or remedies, including any right to
employment or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason
of this Agreement or otherwise limit the right of Contributor, Acquirer and
their respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of any Covered
Employee subject to any applicable requirements of _Section 5.8(c)_, or (ii)
be deemed to amend any employee benefit plan of Contributor, Acquirer, the Co-
Employer or any of their Affiliates.

 

Section 5.9 _Termination and Release Relating to Related-Party Transactions_.

 

On or prior to the Closing Date, Contributor shall cause the Company to (a)
terminate all Contracts with Contributor or any of its Affiliates (other than
those Contracts set forth in _Schedule 5.9_) and (b) deliver irrevocable and
unconditional releases executed by such Affiliates with whom the Company has
terminated such Contracts pursuant to this  _Section 5.9_ providing that no
further payments are due, or may become due, under or in respect of any such
terminated Contacts; _provided that_ , in no event shall the Company pay any
fee or otherwise incur any expense or financial exposure with respect to any
such termination or release; provided for purposes of clarification that no
action contemplated by this _Section 5.9_ shall release Contributor from any
obligation arising under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herby.

Section 5.10 _Monthly Financial Statements_.

 

As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than twenty (20) days
after the end of each calendar month during the period from the date hereof

reports (such reports to be in the form prepared by the Company in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) of the Company for
such preceding month.

 

Section 5.11 _Repayment and Satisfaction of Scheduled Debt_.

 

At least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, Contributor (a) shall
obtain and deliver, or shall cause to be obtained and delivered, to Acquirer
payoff letters from each financial institution or other lender in respect of
any and all Indebtedness of the Company (including the Scheduled Debt), each
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer, confirming the
total payment required to be made as of the Closing Date to repay in full the
amount of such Indebtedness and (b) shall authorize Acquirer to wire transfer
a portion of the Cash Consideration directly to holders of the

efforts to cooperate with, assist and support Acquirers efforts to obtain a
letter from the EPA confirming the Companys or Acquirers ability to qualify

requires Acquirer to obtain a new letter, Contributor shall, and shall cause
the Company to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with, assist
and support Acquirers efforts to obtain such new letter.

 



50 Section 5.13 _Exclusive Dealing_.

 

(a) Until such time, if any, that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, Contributor shall not, and shall cause the Company and the
respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate,
encourage any inquiries, proposals or offers from, discuss or negotiate with,
provide any non-public information to, or consider the merits of any
unsolicited inquiries, proposals or offers from, any Person (other than
Acquirer and its Representatives) relating to any transaction involving the
sale of the business or assets of the Company, the sale of any of the
membership interests or other equity interests of the Company, or any merger,
consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company.

(b) Contributor shall notify Acquirer promptly, but in any event within 24
hours, orally and in writing if Contributor, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives receives any inquiry, proposal,
offer or other contact from any Person with respect to the matters described

(a) Contributor acknowledges and agrees that the WPZ Units constituting the
Equity Consideration shall, when issued, constitute restricted securities that
have not been registered for issuance or transfer under applicable federal or
state securities laws and that such shares and units will, when issued bear a
legend as provided in the Registration Rights Agreement. In addition,
Contributor agrees not to transfer any of the WPZ Units constituting
the Equity Consideration at any time during the period ending eighteen (18)
months after the Closing without the written consent of Acquirer.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.14_, certain of the WPZ Units
constituting the Equity Consideration shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement. Contributor will refrain, for the period
ending eighteen (18) months after the Closing, from transferring or otherwise
disposing of the Equity Consideration in such manner as to cause Acquirer to
be in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act or
applicable state securities or blue sky laws. For the purposes of this
_Section 5.14_, " _transfer_ " (and all correlative terms) means, as to any
WPZ Units, a direct or indirect sale, assignment, conveyance, gift, exchange,
lease or other disposition or transfer of such WPZ Units, whether effected
voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of Law, excluding the creation of
a Lien but including a transfer in connection with, or in lieu of, the
foreclosure of a Lien.

Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Highstar_ "), its
portion of the WPZ Units (other than WPZ Units that are Escrow Units), not to
exceed four and one-half percent (4.5%) of the total WPZ Units that are not
Escrow Units, conditioned upon Highstar delivering to Acquirer (i) a lock-up
letter pursuant to which Highstar agrees (A) to the same restrictions on
transfer set forth in _Section 5.14(a)_ above with respect to the WPZ Units
held in its name and (B) not to receive any benefits under the Registration
Rights Agreement, and (ii) reasonable representations and a reasonable legal
opinion, in each case customary for transfers of this type.

 

Section 5.15 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) For a period of two (2) years following the Closing, Contributor shall
not, and shall cause its direct and indirect subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly through any Person or contractual arrangement:

(i) engage in any gas gathering, processing or fractionation business or any
liquid hydrocarbon business anywhere in the Territory that is of the kind of
businesses currently operated or currently intended by the Company to be

management, executive or supervisory functions with respect to, own, operate,
join, control, render financial assistance to, receive any economic benefit
from, exert any influence upon, participate in, render services or advice to,
or as applicable and within its control, allow any of its officers or
employees to be connected as an officer, employee, partner, member,
stockholder, consultant or otherwise with, any business or Person that
competes in whole or in part with the Business;

(ii) solicit, recruit or hire any person who at any time after the date of
this Agreement becomes a Transferred Employee; _provided that_ , the
foregoing shall not prohibit Contributor or its direct or indirect
subsidiaries from (A) hiring a Transferred Employee who responds to a general
solicitation to the public of general advertising or similar methods of
solicitation by search firms not specifically directed at Transferred
Employees or (B) soliciting, recruiting or hiring any Transferred Employee who
has ceased to be employed or retained by the Company, Acquirer or any of
their respective Affiliates for at least twelve (12) months; or

(iii) approach or seek business in the Territory constituting Restricted
Business from any Customer (as hereinafter defined), refer business in the
Territory constituting Restricted Business from any Customer to any Person or
be paid commissions based on sales from business in the Territory
constituting Restricted Business received from any Customer by any Person (it
being understood that, for purposes of this _Section 5.15_, the term "
_Customer_ " means any Person to which the Company provided products or
services during the twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing Date);
_provided that_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit any referral of business by
Contributor to the Company or Acquirer.

 



52 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 5.15(a)_, none of
the following actions shall be deemed to be a violation of the restrictive
covenants contained in this _Section 5.15(a)_: (A) owning less than five
percent (5%) of any class of securities traded on a national stock exchange
issued by any Person engaged in the Restricted Business; (B) acquiring the
equity securities or assets of any Person of which less than twenty percent
(20%) of its revenues are attributable to the Restricted Business; and (C) the
conduct and continuation of business operations of the kind currently
conducted (including fulfillment of existing obligations under contracts
currently in effect) in the Counties of Greene, Fayette, Somerset, Bedford,
Indiana, Clearfield, Cambria and Blair in Pennsylvania and Preston County in
West Virginia.

(b) For a period of two (2) years following the Closing, Acquirer shall
not, directly or indirectly through any Person or contractual arrangement,
solicit, recruit or hire any person who on the date of this Agreement is an
employee of Contributor (other than the Covered Employees); _provided that_ ,
the foregoing shall not prohibit (A) hiring any such employee who responds to
a general solicitation to the public of general advertising or similar methods
of solicitation by search firms not specifically directed at such employees or
(B) Acquirer or any of its Affiliates from soliciting, recruiting or hiring
any such employee who has ceased to be employed or retained by Contributor or
any of its Affiliates for at least twelve (12) months.

 

(c) Each Party acknowledges that the covenants of such Party set forth in this
_Section 5.15_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that any
breach by a Party of any provision of this _Section 5.15_ may result in
irreparable injury to the other Party. Each Party acknowledges that, in the
event of such a breach, in addition to all other remedies available at Law,
the other Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including
injunctive relief, as well as such other remedies as may be available at law
and equity. Each Party has independently consulted with its counsel and after
such consultation agrees that the covenants set forth in this _Section 5.15_
are reasonable and proper to protect the legitimate interest of the other
Party.

(d) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of _Section 5.15(a)_ are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the Parties that these
provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose only
those restrictions on Contributors conduct that are reasonable in light of
the circumstances and as are necessary to assure to Acquirer the benefits of
this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to
enforce all of the separate covenants of _Section 5.15(a)_ because taken
together they are more extensive than necessary to assure to Acquirer the
intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed by
the Parties that the provisions of _Section 5.15_ that, if eliminated, would
permit the remaining separate provisions to be enforced in such
proceeding, shall be deemed eliminated, for the purposes of such proceeding,
from this Agreement.

Section 5.16 _Casualty Event_.

(a) If, before the Closing, all or any portion of the tangible assets of the
Company (the " _Company Systems_ ") are damaged or destroyed in whole or in
part (the portion of the Company Systems so damaged or destroyed, the "
_Damaged Portion_ "), as a result of any 

 



53  event following the date hereof and prior to the Closing (a " _Casualty
Event_ "), Contributor shall notify Acquirer promptly in writing (a "
_Casualty Event Notice_ ") of the Casualty Event. The Casualty Event Notice
shall include: (i) a reasonable description of the facts and circumstances
surrounding the Casualty Event; (ii) Contributors preliminary assessment of
the effect of the Casualty Event on the Company Systems; (iii) Contributors
preliminary assessment of whether, and the extent to which, any Losses
sustained as a result of such Casualty Event are covered by one or more of
Contributors insurance policies then in effect; and (iv) Contributors
election pursuant to _Section 5.16(b)_, if applicable.

(b) If (i) Contributor reasonably expects the Damaged Portion resulting from a
Casualty Event can be fully remedied and (ii) the Uninsured Casualty Loss
Amount resulting from such Casualty Event is greater than $5,000,000 but less
than $50,000,000, then Contributor may elect, by written notice to Acquirer,
to (x) remedy such Damaged Portion or (y) reduce the amount of the Purchase
Price by such Uninsured Casualty Loss Amount. If, with respect to any
Casualty Event, Contributor elects to remedy the Damaged Portion resulting
therefrom or reduce the Purchase Price pursuant to this _Section 5.16(b)_,
then such Casualty Event shall have no effect for purposes of determining
whether Acquirers conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.2_ have been
fulfilled. If, with respect to such Casualty Event, Contributor elects neither
to remedy the Damaged Portion resulting therefrom nor reduce the Purchase
Price pursuant to this _Section 5.16(b)_, then such Casualty Event shall be
taken into account for purposes of determining whether Acquirers conditions
to Closing set forth in _Section 7.2_ have been fulfilled. 

(c) If Contributor elects to remedy the Damaged Portion pursuant to _Section
5.16(b)_: (i) Contributor shall promptly commence and diligently remedy such
Damaged Portion at its sole cost and expense; (ii) Contributor shall be
entitled to all of the insurance proceeds to which Contributor or any of its
Affiliates are entitled with respect to such Casualty Event; and (iii) the
Closing and the Outside Date shall be delayed and extended for such reasonable
time as is necessary for Contributor to complete any such repair or
restoration.

 

(d) If the Uninsured Casualty Loss Amount resulting from a Casualty Event is
in excess of $50,000,000, then either Party can terminate this Agreement by
written notice to the other Party, unless the Parties agree to a mutually
acceptable reduction in the Purchase Price. If the Uninsured Casualty Loss
Amount resulting from a Casualty Event is $5,000,000 or less, then: (i)
neither Partys rights or obligations under this Agreement shall be affected
in any way; (ii) there will not be a breach of any representation or warranty
by Contributor as a result of the Damaged Portion; (iii) neither Party will
have any right of termination under this Agreement as a result of the Damaged
Portion; and (iv) there shall be no change to the Purchase Price pursuant to
this _Section 5.16_.

 

Section 5.17 _Assignment of Certain Insurance Policies_.

 

On or prior to the Closing Date, Contributor shall assign, or shall cause to
be assigned, to the Company the insurance policy or policies set forth in
_Schedule 3.17_ under the headings "Builders Risk Insurance Policy" and
"Environmental Liability Insurance Policy" with substantially the same terms
and conditions (including coverage, premium amount and limitations of
liability) as those currently contained in such insurance policies
(collectively, the " _Assigned Insurance Policies_ "). Acquirer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause Contributor to be named, or continue
to be named, as an additional insured party under the Assigned Insurance
Policies.

 



54 Section 5.18 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Contributor shall use its reasonable efforts and shall cause the Company
and their respective Representatives to use their reasonable efforts to
provide to Acquirer, at Acquirers sole expense, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Acquirer in connection with the arrangement of any bridge or
other debt financing entered into by Acquirer in connection with the Closing
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (a " _Debt Financing_ ").

(b) Acquirer acknowledges that obtaining the Debt Financing in connection
with the Closing is not a condition to Acquirer complying with its obligations
under this Agreement, including closing the transactions contemplated herein
following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in _Section 7.2_.

For purposes of determining the portion of any Taxes imposed on the Company
for any Straddle Period that are Pre-Closing Taxes, the portion of such Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Effective Straddle Period shall, in the case of any
Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for the Straddle
Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-Effective Straddle
Period be (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related
to income or receipts, deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period _multiplied_ by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire taxable period, and
(ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income or receipts,
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant taxable

take all commercially reasonable actions, and shall cause the Company to take
all commercially reasonable actions, to obtain any Tax refunds to which
Contributor would be entitled pursuant to this _Section 6.5_.

Each Party shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, provide to
the other Party such cooperation, documentation and information as any of them
reasonably may request in filing any 

 



56  Tax Return, determining a liability for Taxes or conducting any audit,

limitation shall not apply with respect to Fraud on the part of Contributor;
and

(iv) notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_, no recovery
from Contributor may be had by Acquirer under _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ until
the Company and Acquirer have first exhausted all legal rights to recovery
that the Company or Acquirer have under the Olin Purchase Agreement and under
the $25,000,000 environmental insurance policy from Indian Harbor Insurance
Company with regard to the Olin site referenced in _Schedule 3.17_ (the "
_Environmental Liability Insurance Policy_ ") to the extent it shall have
been assigned by Contributor to the Company prior to the Closing (it being
understood and agreed that claims for indemnification by Acquirer under or
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(iii)_ shall not be in excess of $25,000,000 in
the aggregate and must be made in writing prior to the currently designated
expiration of the Environmental Liability Insurance Policy); _provided that,_
any claim for indemnification made prior to such expiration shall survive
until thirtieth (30th) day after the Company and Acquirer shall have
exhausted the remedies described in the foregoing part of this _clause (iv)_.

(c) Effective after the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
_Article 9_, Acquirer hereby indemnifies Contributor, its Affiliates and
their respective Representatives (collectively, the " _Contributor
Indemnified Parties_ ") against and shall hold each of them harmless from any
and all Losses incurred or suffered by any such Contributor Indemnified Party
based upon, attributable to or resulting from:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by
Acquirer in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to
_Sections 2.2_ or _7.3_ ( _provided that_ , for the sole purpose of
determining Losses (and not for determining whether or not any breaches of
representations and warranties of Acquirer have occurred), any qualification
or exception contained therein relating to materiality shall be disregarded);
and

 



62 (ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of
Acquirer contained in this Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding _Section 9.2(c)_ above, Acquirers maximum liability for
any Loss under _Section 9.2(c)(i)_ shall not exceed $60,000,000; _provided
that_ , the foregoing limitation shall not apply with respect to (i) any
breach of the covenants, agreements or obligations of Acquirer set forth
in Article 2, (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in the Acquirer Fundamental Representations or (iii) Fraud
on the part of Acquirer.

 

(e) All Losses for which any Acquirer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnity or reimbursement under _Article 6_ or  _Section 9.2(a)_ shall be
paid by Contributor, in its discretion, (x) in cash or (y) by the delivery of
WPZ Units or (z) in the case of claims made against the Escrow Account, by
delivery of all or a portion of the Escrow Property held by the Escrow Agent
as provided in this _Section 9.2(e)_. " _Escrow Period_ " means the period
commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is fifteen (15)
months thereafter; _provided that_ , such period shall be extended as

reimbursement made by an Acquirer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 9.3_
or _9.4_ on or prior to the date that is fifteen (15) months after the
Closing Date.

(i) If the Closing occurs, for any indemnification claims under _Section
9.2(a)(i)_, the Escrow Property shall be the Acquirer Indemnified Parties
sole and exclusive security and source of consideration and recovery, and the
transfer of Escrow Units or payment of cash from the Escrow Account shall be
the Acquirer Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy therefor;
_provided that_ , the limitation in this _Section 9.2(e)(i)_ shall not apply
with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
set forth in the Contributor Fundamental Representations, in the last sentence
of _Section 3.10(d)_ or in _Section 3.16_ (Taxes) or to any knowing and
intentional breach by Contributor of any of the covenants, agreements or
obligations of Contributor set forth in _Article 5_ that are to be performed
prior to the Closing Date or any breach of any of the covenants, agreements or
obligations of Contributor set forth in _Article 2_. Acquirer Indemnified
Parties shall not be limited to the Escrow Property for indemnification claims
based on (A) Fraud on the part of Contributor, (B) _Sections 9.2(a)(ii)_,
_9.2(a)(iii)_ or _9.2(a)(iv)_ , or (C) matters described in the proviso of
the immediately preceding sentence, and they shall have the right to seek
indemnification directly against Contributor without first exhausting the
Escrow Property or seeking indemnification against the Escrow Account;
_provided that_ , Contributor may, in its sole discretion, satisfy any such
indemnification claims by paying cash or delivering WPZ Units (other than the
Escrow Units) to Acquirer in satisfaction of any such claim.

 

(ii) In the event that Contributor satisfies its indemnification obligation
hereunder (or a portion thereof) by the delivery of Escrow Units or other WPZ
Units (instead of cash), the number of such Escrow Units or other WPZ Units to
be delivered to Acquirer shall be based on the quotient of (x) the aggregate
dollar amount payable to the Acquirer Indemnified Party, _divided_ by (y) the
price equal to the volume-weighted average trading price of WPZ Units for the
thirty (30) trading day period ending two (2) trading days prior to the date
of payment.

 



63 (iii) Concurrently with providing notice of indemnity to Contributor under 
_Section 9.3_ or _9.4_ , during the Escrow Period, Acquirer also will provide
written notice to the Escrow Agent of a claim for Losses or reimbursement
under _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_. Upon receipt of any such written claim notice,
the Escrow Agent shall transfer a portion of the Escrow Property (either
Escrow Units or cash, at the discretion of Contributor, based on the
availability of Escrow Units and cash in the Escrow Account) to a Pending
Claims Account (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) in an amount equal to the
amount of Losses set forth in such written claim notice.

(iv) Upon the expiration of the Escrow Period, Contributor shall be entitled
to a transfer of (A) any Escrow Units that are not held by the Escrow Agent in
Pending Claims Accounts under the Escrow Agreement (the " _Released Units_ ")
and (B) any cash in the Escrow Account that is not held by the Escrow Agent in
Pending Claims Accounts under the Escrow Agreement, in each case in accordance
with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(v) At any time, the Parties may jointly instruct, in the manner provided in
the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent to transfer all or a portion of the
Escrow Property to either Contributor or Acquirer, as the Parties may agree.

(vi) Any Escrow Units to be transferred to Acquirer from the Escrow Agent on
behalf of any Acquirer Indemnified Party or other WPZ Units to be transferred
to Acquirer by Contributor to satisfy an indemnification claim shall be
accompanied by a fully executed stock power or other applicable assignment
instrument in the form reasonably acceptable to Acquirer and Contributor.

 

(vii) Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement or any of the
other Transaction Documents, any dividends or other distributions made in
respect of the Escrow Units (whether made in cash or equity securities and
whether held in the Escrow Account or the Pending Claims Account) shall be
paid (or issued) to Contributor, and all voting rights associated with the
Escrow Units shall be exercised by Contributor.

Section 9.3 _Third-Party Claim Procedures_. 

(a) The Party seeking indemnification under _Section 9.2_ (the " _Indemnified
Party_ ") agrees to give prompt notice in writing to the Party against whom
indemnity is to be sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the assertion of
any claim or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any Third
Party (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under _Section 9.2_. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
Third-Party Claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the
information then available to the Indemnified Party) and, to the extent
practicable, an estimate of Losses. So long as the notice thereof is given
within the applicable survival period set forth in _Section 9.1_, the failure
to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its obligations or liability hereunder, except to the extent such failure
shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. Thereafter, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the
Indemnified Partys receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

 



64 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to reasonable participation in
the defense of any Third-Party Claim at its own cost. If the Indemnifying
Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified
Party against the Losses set forth in the Indemnified Partys indemnification
notice, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall continue to be entitled to assert any limitation of
any claims contained in this _Article 9_.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such Third-
Party Claim pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_, it shall, within thirty (30) days
after receiving the Indemnified Partys indemnification notice, notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its intent to do so and the Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof, except as otherwise provided below. The Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to assume control of such defense of the Third-Party Claim only for
so long as it conducts such defense with diligence. The Indemnifying Party
shall keep the Indemnified Parties advised of the status of such Third-Party
Claim and the defense thereof on a reasonably current basis and shall
consider in good faith the recommendations made by the Indemnified Parties
with respect thereto. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the control of the
defense of any Third-Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this
_Section 9.3_, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any such Third-Party Claim and to employ, at its expense, separate
counsel of its choice for such purpose, it being understood, however, that
the Indemnifying Party shall continue to control such defense; _provided that_
, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall pay the
reasonable costs and expenses of such defense (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) of the Indemnified Party if (i) the
Indemnified Partys outside counsel shall have reasonably concluded and
advised in writing (with a copy to the Indemnifying Party) that there are
defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party or (ii) the
Indemnified Partys outside counsel shall have advised in writing (with a copy
to the Indemnifying Party) that there is a conflict of interest that would
make it inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to
have common counsel for the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Party shall not be permitted to settle, compromise, take any corrective or
remedial action or enter into an agreed judgment or consent decree, in each
case, that subjects the Indemnified Party to any criminal liability, requires
an admission of guilt or wrongdoing on the part of the Indemnified Party or
imposes any continuing obligation on or requires any payment from the
Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Partys prior written consent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Each Party shall reasonably cooperate, and cause their
respective Affiliates to reasonably cooperate, in the defense or prosecution
of any Third-Party Claim and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

 



65 Section 9.4 _Direct Claim Procedures_.

 

If the Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnity under _Section 9.2_
against the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party agrees to give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the
Indemnifying Party. Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such
claim and the basis for indemnification (taking into account the information
then available to the Indemnified Party) and, to the extent practicable, an
estimate of Losses. So long as the notice thereof is given within the
applicable survival period set forth in _Section 9.1_, the failure to so
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually
prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 

Section 9.5 _Calculation of Losses_.

(a) The amount of any Losses payable under _Section 9.2_ by the Indemnifying
Party shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party
under applicable insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible therefor, _less_ reasonable costs or expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in obtaining such recovery. If the Indemnified Party
receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other
Person alleged to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an
indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or
expense incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such
indemnification payment up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified
Party ( _less_ (i) the aggregate amount of applicable Losses incurred or
suffered by the Indemnified Party for which Indemnifying Party did not
indemnify the Indemnified Party (it being understood and agreed that, for
purposes of this clause, any amount of Losses set off against the Basket
Amount shall be deemed to have been paid by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party) and (ii) any reasonable cost or expense incurred by the
Indemnified Party in obtaining such recovery).

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under _Section 9.2_ for any
punitive or exemplary Losses, except to the extent the Indemnified Party is
required to pay any amounts to any Third Party for such Losses in regard to a
matter that is otherwise indemnifiable hereunder. In addition, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Losses indemnifiable by Contributor under
_Section 9.2(a)_ shall expressly exclude any and all diminution in value of
any Person other than the Company (or its successor), including any decrease
in the value or price of WPZ Units.

(c) Contributor shall have no obligation to indemnify Acquirer or its
Affiliates pursuant to _Section 9.2_ with respect to any Losses or alleged
Losses to the extent that the matter forming the basis for such Losses or
alleged Losses was taken into account in the determination of Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Amount.

 

(d) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax purposes. 

 



66 Section 9.6 _Exclusivity_.

 

Except for equitable remedies and such other remedies expressly provided for
in this Agreement, including those provided in  _Sections 2.3_ and _10.12_ ,
after the Closing, this _Article 9_ will provide the exclusive remedy for
each Party for any and all claims relating to this Agreement or the sale and
purchase of the Company, including any misrepresentation, breach of warranty,
covenant or other agreement or other claim arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (other than equitable remedies as they
relate to breaches of covenants or other agreements contained herein to the
extent such covenants or agreements are to be performed after the Closing),
regardless of applicable Law or the legal theory under which such liability or
obligation may be sought to be imposed, whether sounding in contract or tort,
or whether at law or in equity or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall preclude any Party from asserting a claim (a) of Fraud or
(b) arising under any Transaction Document other than this Agreement 

Section 9.7 _Non-Recourse_.

No Party shall have recourse whatsoever under this Agreement against any of
the Representatives of the other Parties (including for such purposes, the
Representatives of any Affiliate of a Party). Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, Acquirer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and
Contributor, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, each hereby fully and
irrevocably waive any right, claim or entitlement whatsoever against
such Representatives relating to any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
any of them arising from, based upon, related to, or associated with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any
breach, termination or failure to consummate such transactions) in each case
whether based on contract, tort, strict liability other laws or otherwise and
whether by piercing of the corporate veil, by claim on behalf of or by a Party
or other Person or otherwise.

of the State of Texas, without regard to the conflicts of law rules thereof.

Each Party shall give prompt notice to each other Party upon acquiring
Knowledge of Contributor or Knowledge of Acquirer, as the case may be, of (a)
the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event which such Party has determined

representation or warranty made by such Party 

 



70  contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect and (b) any failure, or the occurrence of nonoccurrence of any event
of which such Party has determined after obtaining knowledge thereof would be
reasonably likely to cause the failure, by such Party to comply with or
satisfy, in any material respect, any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided, however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 10.8_ shall not limit or

Agreement.

 

Section 10.10 _Severability_.

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a
court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid,
void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not
affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such a
determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 10.11 _Disclosure Schedules_.

Contributor has set forth information on the Disclosure Schedules that
correspond to the sections of this Agreement to which each such Schedule
relates. A matter set forth in one section of the Disclosure Schedules need

section of the Disclosure Schedules or section of this Agreement is reasonably
apparent. The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Disclosure Schedules
may include certain items and information solely for informational purposes
for the convenience of Acquirer and (b) the disclosure by Contributor of any
matter in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an
acknowledgment by Contributor that the matter is required to be disclosed by
the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

Section 10.12 _Specific Performance_.

The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required under this
Agreement in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) and that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches (or threatened breaches) of this 

 



71  Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order
or injunction. If, prior to the Outside Date, any Party brings any action to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement by any other Party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended
by (a) the amount of time during which such action is pending, _plus_ twenty
(20) Business Days, or (b) such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action.

 

Section 10.13 _Waiver of Conflicts; Attorney Client Privilege_.

 

(a) Acquirer waives and will not assert, and Acquirer agrees to cause its
Affiliates (including the Company) to waive and not to assert, any conflict
of interest arising out of or relating to the representation, after the
Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of Contributor or any of its
Affiliates or any present or former shareholder, officer, employee, manager
or director of Contributor or any of its Affiliates (any such Person, a "
_Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated hereby, by any legal counsel
currently representing Contributor or any of its Affiliates in connection with
this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Current Representation_ ").

 

(b) Acquirer waives and will not assert, and Acquirer agrees to cause its
Affiliates (including the Company) to waive and not assert, any attorney
client privilege with respect to any communication between any legal counsel
and any Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation in
connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including in connection with
a dispute with Acquirer or any of its Affiliates, it being the intention of
the Parties that all such rights to such attorney client privilege and to
control such attorney client privilege shall be retained by Contributor;
_provided that_ , the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall
not extend to any communication not involving this Agreement or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, or to communications with any
Person other than the Designated Persons. 

Section 10.14 _No Presumption Against Drafting Party_.

 

Each Party has fully participated in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity, question or intent or question of interpretation
arises, this Agreement must be construed as if drafted jointly, and there must
not be any presumption, inference or conclusion drawn against any Party by

ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGY

The Company will provide the " _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ", "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ ", the " _Estimated Pre-Closing Capital
Expenditures Amount_ " and the " _Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment Amount_
" as specified below.



   A. | _ _Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet__ will contain the
following classifications, derived and supported in such a manner as defined
herein, all of which will be supported by sufficient general ledger detail
and supporting documentation for review and confirmation: 
---|--- 



     | 1. | Cash and Cash Equivalentsthere will be no balances to report
as these elements are maintained by an Affiliate. The Company does not have
any bank accounts.  
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | Accounts Receivable ("A/R")the following components are
maintained in the Companys A/R account and will be derived and documented in
the following manner: 
---|---|--- 



     | a) | Revenuewill be based on invoiced (actuals) and uncollected
revenues, to the extent they exist, as well as accrued revenues for the
current month of business. The accrual will be based on the Companys accrual
model results for the month in which the closing occurs. Principally, the
model calculates the accrual based on forecasted volumes and actual contracted
rates/fees for the month. The amount of the accrual will be proportionally
adjusted based on available scada volumes for the days of flow and projected
forward to the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | b) | Billing for Aid-In-Construct  are recorded as invoiced to
the customer. The balance in this account will be supported by invoices
presented to the customer and any offsetting receipts. 
---|---|--- 



     | c) | Imbalancegas and liquid imbalances are calculated and
supported by the Companys monthly allocation and invoice for each particular
system or plant. Company will use the imbalance from the most recently
submitted invoice. 
---|---|--- 



     | d) | Volume Commitmentrelates to a minimum flow requirement on a
particular contract. Company will use the value carried on the most recently
submitted invoice.  
---|---|--- 



     | e) | Otherany other receivables will be supported by appropriate
documentation. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 3. | Prepaid Expenses ("Prepaids")are characterized as
distinguished below. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | a) | Cash/Surety Bondbalances will be supported by either a cash
receipt if they are cash bonds or some other type of security document whether
that be a Letter of Credit or Bond. Currently the Company only has Cash Bonds
outstanding which are in support of West Virginia permits. 
---|---|--- 
 



Schedule 2.3(a)

6 and are generally returned or applied to final invoices upon satisfactory
project completion. These advances will be supported by the contract and
payment made on behalf of the Company. 
---|---|--- 



     | c) | Depositsare required by various vendor / service providers
which are primarily utility deposits for the Company. The balance will be
supported by invoices and/or any receipts reducing such deposits. These
balances are fairly static. 
---|---|--- 



     | d) | Otherany other prepaid expenses will be supported by
appropriate documentation. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 4. | Property, Plant, and Equipment ("PPandE")will be an
accumulation of actual expenditures paid and recorded by the company in
addition to the amounts accrued in 6(a) below. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5. | Accounts Payable ("A/P")consists of the following types of
A/P accounts 
---|---|--- 
 



     | a) | Trade A/Pthe balance will be supported by invoices that have
been recorded in the sub and general ledger of the Company as of three days
prior to the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | b) | Project Retention A/Pexists when construction contracts
provide for a percentage of invoice to be withheld until satisfactory
completion of a project. The balance in this account will be supported by the
contract, an invoice, and a schedule detailing the amounts withheld for
retention. 
---|---|--- 



     | c) | Other A/Pany other accounts payable will be supported by
appropriate documentation. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 6. | Accrued Payable balances are determined for Capex, Opex, and
GandA: 
---|---|--- 



     | a) | Capex Accrualwill include (a) unposted invoices still in the
approval process and (b) Operations personnels projections of work performed
for which the Company has not yet received the invoice. The accrual will
account for the activities performed up to the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 



     | b) | Opex Accrualwill include any worked performed in support of
operating and maintaining the assets, but not yet invoiced and /or recorded in
the Companys ledger. A large component of the accrual is related to ad
valorem tax. The monthly ad valorem is based on the Companys capital forecast
and will be reduced proportionately on a straight-line basis should closing
occur prior to the end of the month. 
---|---|--- 



     | c) | GandA Accrualeach month the Company is allocated and charged a
prorata share of the Contributors GandA. An accrual will be recorded on
the Companys books for an amount calculated by multiplying the Contributors
budgeted GandA expense for the month of closing times the allocation percentage
determined (and supported) by the Contributor and further reduced
proportionately by the number of days of the month prior to the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 
 



Schedule 2.3(a)

7 related costs to be paid by the Acquirer, including bonus and paid time off
accruals. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 7. | Long Term Deferred Revenueis related to a Chevron condensate
system contract whereby the cash received under the contract is accelerated
faster than the amortization period for revenue recognition. The monthly
change to Deferred Revenue is consistent month to month and will readily to be
prorated to any mid-month settlement. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 8. | Intercompany notes payablerepresents the cumulative balance
due to the Companys parent and other affiliates. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 9. | Members Equity (Deficit)will represent the cumulative
retained earnings of the Company from its inception including a prorated net
income attributable to the month of the Closing Date. 
---|---|--- 



   B. | _ _Estimated Net Working Capital__ is calculated by adding the
Current Assets (items A.1, A.2 and A.3 above) and subtracting the sum of (i)
Current Liabilities (items A.5 and A.6, above) and (ii) Long Term Deferred
Revenue A.7. To the extent that any of the Net Working Capital items are
settled or paid directly to a vendor or customer (i.e. replacement of a cash
or surety bond), those amounts will be excluded from consideration in the
_Estimate Net Working Capital_. For purposes of clarity, Estimated Net Working
Capital does not include any indebtedness accounts. See attached example
calculation. 
---|--- 
 



   C. | _ _Estimated Pre-Closing Capital Expenditures Amount__ this
amount represents the amount of cost incurred on the Companys capital
projects between January 1, 2012 and the Closing Date for Pre-Approved
Capital Expenditures less the sum of (i) Aid In Construction receipts from
January 1, 2012 through the date of the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet
and (ii) Aid in Construction Receivables on the Closing Date Balance Sheet.
These costs will be exclusive of any Capitalized Interest charged to the
Company. The amount will be derived as follows: 
---|--- 
 



     | 1. | The sum of all Pre-Approved Capital Expenditures recorded in
the general ledger of the Company, including amounts accrued in 6(a) above,
with a date incurred of January 1, 2012 or later. This total will represent
invoices or journal entries paid, accrued or otherwise recorded to the asset
accounts of the Company during this timeframe. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 2. | Less (a) the sum of any asset sales from January 1, 2012
through the date of Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet, (b) the sum of any
PPandE material transfers outside of the company from January 1, 2012 through
the date of the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet (c) the sum of Aid In
Construction receipts from January 1, 2012 through the date of the Estimated
Closing Date Balance Sheet and (d) Aid In Construction on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet.

[SIGNATURE PAGE TO ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT] ESCROW AGREEMENT

 

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated [ _ _], 2012,
is entered into by and among Caiman Energy, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Contributor_ "), Williams Partners L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (" _Acquirer_ "), and Wells Fargo N.A., a [ _ _]
banking corporation (" _Escrow Agent_ "). Contributor, Acquirer and
Escrow Agent are referred to herein sometimes individually as a " _Party_ "
and collectively as the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used but not defined
in this Agreement have the meanings assigned to them in the
Contribution Agreement (as defined below).

RECITALS

A. Contributor and Acquirer entered into that certain Contribution Agreement,
dated March [ _ _], 2012 (the " _Contribution Agreement_ "), under which
Acquirer agreed to purchase from Contributor, and Contributor agreed to sell,
all of the outstanding membership interests in Caiman Eastern Midstream, LLC,
a Texas limited liability company (the " _Company_ ").

 

B. Under Section 2.2(b)(ii) of the Contribution Agreement, in connection with
the Closing thereunder, Acquirer and Contributor agreed to execute and
deliver this Agreement and deposit in the Escrow Account (as defined below) [
_ _] WPZ Units (the " _Escrow Units_ ") to be available
to satisfy certain obligations of Contributor that may arise under the
Contribution Agreement after the Closing.

C. The Parties desire to set forth further terms and conditions in addition
to those set forth in the Contribution Agreement relating to the operation of
the Escrow Account.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals, the mutual
covenants and agreements set forth herein, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereby agree as follows:

1\. _Appointment_. Acquirer and Contributor hereby appoint Escrow Agent as
their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and Escrow Agent hereby
accepts such appointment under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

2\. _Escrow Account_. At the Closing, Acquirer shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to Escrow Agent, in accordance with Section 2.2(b)(ii) of the
Contribution Agreement, the Escrow Units in certificated form, as more fully
identified on _Schedule 3_ attached hereto, to be held in Contributors name
by Escrow Agent in a separate account designated and maintained by Escrow
Agent (the " _Escrow Account_ ") for the benefit of Acquirer and Contributor
as provided in this Agreement and the Contribution Agreement. Escrow Agent
shall provide notice to Contributor and Acquirer that it is in possession of
the Escrow Units upon receipt thereof and shall hold the Escrow Units in the
Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

3\. _Rights of Ownership, Distributions and Voting_.

(a) While the Escrow Units remain in escrow pursuant to this Agreement,
Contributor will retain and will be able to exercise all incidents of
ownership of said Escrow Units that are not inconsistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement. The Escrow Units held pursuant to this
Agreement will be shown as issued and outstanding on the books and records of
Acquirer. (b) During the term of this Agreement, any dividends or other
distributions (" _Distributions_ ") made in respect of the Escrow Units
(whether made in cash, WPZ Units or other equity securities) shall be paid (or
issued) directly to Contributor by Acquirer, free and clear of any and all
Liens, and shall not be placed into the Escrow Account or be subject to this
Escrow Agreement. To the extent that any Distributions are delivered to Escrow
Agent, Escrow Agent is authorized to and shall deliver to Contributor such
Distributions within five (5) Business Days of Escrow Agent receiving such
Distributions (i) in the case of a cash Distribution, by wire transfer to the
account or accounts specified in writing by Contributor to Escrow Agent, or
(ii) in the case of a Distribution paid in WPZ Units or other equity
securities, by delivery of Common Units or such other equity securities to the
address or address specified in writing by Contributor to Escrow Agent.

 

(c) During the term of this Agreement, Contributor shall have the right to
exercise all of the voting rights pertaining to the Escrow Units on all
matters submitted to the unitholders of Acquirer. Acquirer shall deliver
directly to Contributor, and not to Escrow Agent, all notices, solicitations
or other documents or information issued to Acquirers unitholders generally
with respect to the WPZ Units, including, but not limited to, all proxy
materials (collectively, " _Voting Materials_ "). To the extent that any
Voting Materials are sent to Escrow Agent, Escrow Agent shall promptly deliver
such Voting Materials to Contributor at Contributors address specified in
_Section 11_ or otherwise specified in writing by Contributor to Escrow
Agent.

4\. _Disposition_.

(a) _Pending Claims Account_. Upon Escrow Agents receipt of a written notice
of a claim (each, a " _Claim_ ") for indemnity or reimbursement pursuant to
and in accordance with Section 9.2 of the Contribution Agreement (each, a "
_Claim Notice_ "), the number of Escrow Units set forth in the Claim Notice
corresponding to the amount of such Claim shall immediately be deemed to be
part of a pending claims account (the " _Pending Claims Account_ "). Each
Claim Notice shall include the number of Escrow Units to be deemed part of
the Pending Claims Account, which number of Escrow Units shall be equal to the
quotient of (x) the aggregate dollar amount of such Claim divided by (y) the
value of each Escrow Unit, which value shall be deemed to be equal to the
thirty (30) day, volume-weighted average trading price of the Escrow Units
ending two (2) trading days prior to the date of such Claim Notice. In the
case of fractional Escrow Units, the number of Escrow Units shall be rounded
up to the nearest whole number. Escrow Agent shall have no obligation to
calculate the number of Escrow Units to be deemed part of the Pending Claims
Account pursuant to a Claim Notice. For the avoidance of doubt, no
separate certificate(s) need be created or held for such Escrow Units deemed
part of the Pending Claims Account and no certificates representing Escrow
Units in the Pending Claims Account need be physically segregated. Escrow
Agent shall release and disburse the Escrow Units, whether or not deemed in
the Pending Claims Account, as follows:

(i) promptly upon, and in any event no later than three (3) Business Days
after receipt of, and in accordance with, joint written instructions executed
by both Acquirer and Contributor (a " _Joint Written Instruction_ "); or

 



2 (ii) as promptly as practicable, and in any event no later than three (3)
Business Days after Escrow Agents receipt of, and in accordance with, a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction (a "
_Final Court Order_ "); or

 

(iii) after fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date, pursuant to a
Contributor Release Notice delivered pursuant to  _Section 4(c)_.

(b) _Release of Escrow Units_.

 

(i) If Escrow Agent receives direction pursuant to a Joint Written Instruction
or a Final Court Order for the disbursement of Escrow Units from the Escrow
Account or Pending Claims Account at any time or receives from Contributor a
Contributor Release Notice (as defined below), Escrow Agent shall disburse all
or a portion of the Escrow Units in accordance with such Joint
Written Instruction, Final Court Order or Contributor Release Notice. Each
such Joint Written Instruction, Final Court Order or Contributor Release
Notice requiring the disbursement of Escrow Units shall (i) identify the
number of Escrow Units to be disbursed by Escrow Agent, (ii) identify the
name of the parties to whom such Escrow Units are to be disbursed, and (iii)
include instructions (" _Delivery Instructions_ ") to deliver the appropriate
certificate(s) held by Escrow Agent in the Escrow Account to Acquirers
transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (the " _Transfer Agent_ "),
for exchange and/or cancellation. Concurrently with the delivery of each Joint
Written Instruction, Final Court Order or Contributor Release Notice
containing Delivery Instructions, Acquirer and Contributor shall deliver to
the Transfer Agent, with a copy to Escrow Agent, a joint written instruction
directing the Transfer Agent to (A) cancel the certificate(s) representing
Escrow Units it receives from Escrow Agent, (B) issue and deliver to Escrow
Agent new physical certificates, if any, in Contributors name representing
such WPZ Units to be returned and continued to be held by Escrow Agent in
accordance with such instructions, and/or (C) issue and deliver to Contributor
or its designee in book-entry form (unless otherwise requested by Contributor)
the number of WPZ Units, if any, to be delivered to Contributor in accordance
with such instructions (each, a " _Transfer Agent Instruction_ "). Contributor
and Acquirer shall take such further actions, including the delivery of
notices and documents required by the Transfer Agent, as are
reasonably necessary to effectuate the foregoing.

(ii) No later than two (2) Business Days after the expiration of the
Escrow Period (as defined below), Acquirer and Contributor shall deliver to
Escrow Agent a Joint Written Instruction to transfer to Contributor all of the
remaining Escrow Units held in the Escrow Account that have not been deemed as
part of the Pending Claims Account.

(iii) Contributor shall deliver a fully executed stock power to Escrow Agent
on the Closing Date in the form reasonably acceptable to Acquirer and
Contributor. Any Escrow Units to be transferred to Acquirer from Escrow Agent
on behalf of any Acquirer Indemnified Party shall be accompanied by such fully
executed stock power. Contributor agrees to execute and deliver such other
documents, certificates, agreements and other writings (including stock
powers) and to take such other actions as may be necessary or desirable in
order to transfer the Escrow Units to Acquirer as contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



3 (iv) Any Escrow Units that have been deemed as part of the Pending Claims
Account at the end of the Escrow Period shall be retained by Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until such time as Escrow Agent is
instructed to distribute such Escrow Units, if any, pursuant to a Joint
Written Instruction or Final Court Order. 

(v) If Contributor satisfies a Claim in cash in accordance with Section 9.2(e)
of the Contribution Agreement and Escrow Units have been deemed as part of
the Pending Claims Account in respect of such Claim, Acquirer and Contributor
shall deliver a Joint Written Instruction to Escrow Agent releasing such
Escrow Units to the Escrow Account or to Contributor, as applicable.

(vi) Neither Acquirer nor Contributor shall provide any notice or instruction
to the Transfer Agent in contravention of a Transfer Agent Instruction.

(vii) For the purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Escrow Period_ " shall
mean the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the later to occur
of (A) fifteen (15) months following the Closing Date and (B) the date on
which all obligations of Contributor with respect to any claim for indemnity
or reimbursement made by an Acquirer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.3
or Section 9.4 of the Contribution Agreement on or prior to the date that is
fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date have been settled or resolved.

(c) In the event that Acquirer fails to timely execute a Joint Written
Instruction under  _Section 4(b)(ii)_ after the expiration of the Escrow
Period, Contributor may give unilateral written notice (" _Contributor Release
Notice_ ") to Escrow Agent with a copy to Acquirer directing Escrow Agent to
release and transfer to Contributor all of the remaining Escrow Units held in
the Escrow Account that have not been deemed as part of the Pending Claims
Account in the case of a notice under _Section 4(b)(ii_) certifying that
Acquirer has failed, after written notice from Contributor, to execute a
Joint Written Instruction under _Section 4(b)(ii)_ and Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to and shall on the first Business Day after three (3) Business Days
following receipt of the Contributor Release Notice release and disburse the
applicable Escrow Units as directed in the Contributors Release Notice unless
Escrow Agent and Contributor have received during such three (3) Business Day
period a written notice from Acquirer wherein Acquirer objects to the release
of such Escrow Units, such notice to include a description of the legal basis
supporting Acquirers objection to the Escrow Units being released.

 

(d) _Substitution of Cash for Escrow Units_. At any time during the Escrow
Period, with the prior written consent of Acquirer (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), Contributor may elect by written notice to the Escrow
Agent and Acquirer (" _Cash Substitution Notice_ ") elect to substitute cash
for all of the Escrow Units held in the Escrow Account by depositing cash
into the Escrow Account in exchange for Escrow Units with the Escrow Units
subject to substitution being valued at a value equal to the thirty (30) day
volume weighted average trading price of Escrow Units ending two trading days
prior to the date of release of such Escrow Units from the Escrow Account in
exchange for cash. Upon Acquirers receipt of the Cash Substitution Notice,
the parties agree that _Section 4(a_) and _Section 4(b)_ shall be replaced
in its entirety by the provisions set forth in _Schedule 4_ attached hereto.

 



4 5\. _Escrow Agent_.

(a) _Duties_. Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically
and expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in
nature, and no other duties shall be implied. Escrow Agent shall neither be
responsible for, nor chargeable with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements
to comply with, the terms and conditions of any other agreement, instrument or
document between the Parties, in connection herewith, if any, including
without limitation the Contribution Agreement, nor shall Escrow Agent be
required to determine if any person or entity has complied with the
Contribution Agreement, nor shall any additional obligations of Escrow Agent
be inferred from the terms of the Contribution Agreement, even though
reference thereto may be made in this Agreement. In the event of any conflict
between the terms and provisions of this Agreement and those of the
Contribution Agreement, any schedule or exhibit attached to the Contribution
Agreement, or any other agreement, the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall control as between Escrow Agent, on the one hand, and Contributor and
Acquirer, on the other hand; _provided, however_ , that the terms and
conditions of the Contribution Agreement shall control as between Contributor
and Acquirer. Escrow Agent may rely upon and shall not be liable for acting or
refraining from acting upon any written notice, document, instruction
or request furnished to it hereunder and believed in good faith by it to be
genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties
without inquiry and without requiring substantiating evidence of any kind.
Escrow Agent shall not be liable to Acquirer or Contributor, any beneficiary
or other person for refraining from acting upon any instruction setting forth,
claiming, containing, objecting to, or related to the transfer or distribution
of the Escrow Units, or any portion thereof, unless such instruction shall
have been delivered to Escrow Agent in accordance with this Agreement and
Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as
may be required hereunder. Escrow Agent shall be under no duty to inquire
into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content of any such document,
notice, instruction or request. Escrow Agent shall have no duty or obligation
to confirm or verify the accuracy or correctness of any amounts deposited
with it hereunder.

(b) _No Liability_. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith except to the extent that
a final adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction determines that
Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct was the primary cause of
any loss. Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers and perform any of its
duties hereunder directly or through Affiliates or agents; _provided that_
Escrow Agent shall be responsible for the performance of such duties to the
standards set forth herein. Escrow Agent will not be liable for the
negligence or misconduct of any Affiliates or agents selected by it in good
faith and with reasonable care, except to the extent that a final adjudication
of a court of competent jurisdiction determines that Escrow Agents or
its Affiliates or agents gross negligence or willful misconduct was the
primary cause of any loss. Escrow Agent may consult with counsel, accountants
and other skilled persons selected with reasonable care and retained by it, at
the expense of Acquirer and Contributor, which expense shall be paid fifty
percent (50%) by Contributor and fifty percent (50%) by Acquirer, as to any
matter relating to this Agreement, and Escrow Agent shall not incur any
liability in acting in good faith in accordance with any advice from such
counsel. If Escrow Agent shall be uncertain or believe there is some ambiguity
as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall receive instructions, claims or
demands from any Party hereto which, in its opinion, conflict with any of the
provisions of this Agreement, it shall be entitled to refrain from taking any
action and its sole obligation shall be to keep safely all property held in
escrow until it shall be given a direction in writing by the Parties which
eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the satisfaction of Escrow Agent
or by a Final Court

 



5  Order. To the extent practical, the Parties agree to pursue any redress or
recourse in connection with any dispute without making Escrow Agent a party to
the same. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no
event shall Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect
or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not
limited to lost profits), even if Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

6\. _Succession_.

 

(a) _Resignation_. Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties
or obligations hereunder by giving thirty (30) days advance notice in
writing of such resignation to the Parties specifying a date when such
resignation shall take effect. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following
receipt of the notice of resignation, Escrow Agent may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor escrow agent or for
other appropriate relief, and any such resulting appointment shall be binding
upon all of the Parties hereto. Escrow Agents sole responsibility after such
thirty (30) day notice period expires shall be to hold the Escrow Units
(without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to
a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, or in accordance with the
directions of a Final Court Order, at which time of delivery Escrow Agents
obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate, subject to the provisions
of  _Section 8_.

(b) _Merger_. Any entity into which Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or
substantially all the escrow business may be transferred, shall be Escrow
Agent under this Agreement without further act.

7\. _Compensation and Reimbursement_. Acquirer and Contributor agree
severally, not jointly, (a) to pay Escrow Agent upon execution of this
Agreement and from time to time thereafter reasonable compensation for the
services to be rendered hereunder as described in _Schedule 1_ attached
hereto, and (b) to pay or reimburse Escrow Agent upon request for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and expenses,
incurred, or made by it in connection with the performance, modification, and
termination of this Agreement (without duplication of any amounts to be paid
in accordance with _Section 8_). Escrow Agent shall send a written request
to Contributor and Acquirer for such expenses, which expenses shall be paid
fifty percent (50%) by Contributor and fifty percent (50%) by Acquirer.
Annual fees are due annually in advance for each year or any part thereof.
Expenses payable pursuant to this _Section 7_ shall be paid fifteen (15)
Business Days after receipt of the written request. The obligations contained
in this  _Section 7_ shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
resignation, replacement or removal of Escrow Agent.

8.  _Indemnity_. Acquirer and Contributor shall severally, and not jointly,
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Escrow Agent and its Affiliates and their
respective successors, assigns, directors, agents and employees (the "
_Indemnitees_ ") from and against and reimburse Escrow Agent for all
reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses and court costs and
all Damages arising out of or in connection with (a) Escrow Agents execution
and performance of this Agreement, the enforcement of any rights or remedies
under or in connection with this Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any
act, omission, or error of the Indemnitee, except in the case of any
Indemnitee to the extent that such Losses are finally adjudicated by a court
of competent jurisdiction to have been caused by the , gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, or (b) Escrow Agents action in
accordance with any Joint Written Instruction. The indemnity obligations set
forth in this _Section 8_ shall survive the resignation, replacement, or
removal of Escrow Agent or the termination of this Agreement and Acquirer and
Contributor agree that liability pursuant to this _Section 8_ shall be
allocated fifty percent (50%) to Contributor and fifty percent (50%) to
Acquirer.

 



6 9\. _Patriot Act Disclosure_. The Parties acknowledge that in order to help
the United States government fight the funding of terrorism and money
laundering activities, pursuant to Federal regulations that became effective
on October 1, 2003 (Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act) requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify, record and update information that identifies
each person establishing a relationship or opening an account. The Parties
agree that they will provide to Escrow Agent such information as it may
request, from time to time, in order for Escrow Agent to satisfy the
requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, including but not limited to the name,
address, tax identification number and other information that will allow it to
identify the individual or entity who is establishing the relationship or
opening the account and may also ask for formation documents such as articles
of incorporation or other identifying documents to be provided.

10.  _Force Majeure_. Escrow Agent shall not incur any liability for not
performing any act or fulfilling any duty, obligation or responsibility
hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond the control of Escrow Agent
(including but not limited to any act or provision of any present or future
law or regulation or governmental authority, any act of God or war, civil
unrest, local or national disturbance or disaster, any act of terrorism, or
the unavailability of the Federal Reserve Bank wire or facsimile or other
wire or communication facility).

11\. _Notices_. All communications hereunder shall be in writing and except
for communications from the Parties setting forth, claiming, containing,
objecting to, or in any way related to the transfer or distribution of units
or funds, including but not limited to transfer instructions pursuant to
_Section 4_ of this Agreement (all of which shall be specifically governed
by _Section 12_ below), shall be deemed to be duly given and received: (a)
upon delivery, if delivered personally, or upon confirmed transmittal, if by
facsimile; or (b) on the next Business Day if sent prepaid by overnight,
nationally-recognized courier to the appropriate notice address set forth
below or at such other address as any Party may have furnished to the other
Parties in writing by registered mail, return receipt requested.

Notwithstanding the above, in the case of communications delivered to Escrow
Agent, such communications shall be deemed to have been given on the date
received by an officer of Escrow Agent or any employee of Escrow Agent who
reports directly to any such officer at the above-referenced office. In the
event that Escrow Agent, in its reasonable discretion, shall determine that an
emergency exists, Escrow Agent may use such other means of communication as
Escrow Agent deems reasonably appropriate. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Business Day_ " shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or any
other day on which Escrow Agent located at the notice address set forth above
is authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed.

12\. _Security Procedures_.

 

(a) _Instructions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary as set forth in
_Section 11_, any and all instructions setting forth, claiming, containing,
objecting to, or in any way related to the distribution of Escrow Units,
including but not limited to any such transfer instructions that may otherwise
be set forth in a Joint Written Instruction, may be given to Escrow Agent
only by confirmed facsimile and no instruction for or related to the transfer
of the Escrow Units, or any portion thereof, shall be deemed delivered and
effective unless Escrow Agent shall have received such instruction by
facsimile at the number provided to the Parties by Escrow Agent in accordance
with _Section 11_ and as further evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to that
number.

(b) _Confirmation_. If Escrow Units transfer instructions are so received by
Escrow Agent by facsimile, Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of
such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated
on _Schedule 2_ hereto, and Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of
anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. The persons and
telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in a writing actually

 



8  received and acknowledged by Escrow Agent. If Escrow Agent is unable to
contact any of the authorized representatives identified in _Schedule 2_ ,
Escrow Agent is hereby authorized both to receive written instructions from
and seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one
or more of Contributors or Acquirers executive officers, (each such person,
an " _Executive Officer_ "), as Escrow Agent may select. Such " _Executive
Officer_ " shall deliver to Escrow Agent a fully executed incumbency
certificate, and Escrow Agent may rely, to the extent reasonable under the
circumstances, upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such
officer. Escrow Agent may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar
identifying numbers provided by Contributor and Acquirer.

(c) _Change in Instructions_. Any Party may unilaterally modify only its funds
transfer instructions in this _Section 12_, by written notice to Escrow
Agent. The Parties acknowledge that the security procedures set forth in this
_Section 12_ are commercially reasonable.

13\. _Compliance with Court Orders_. If any Escrow Units shall be attached,
garnished or levied upon by any court order, or the delivery thereof shall be
stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any order, judgment, or decree
shall be made or entered by any court order affecting the property deposited
under this Agreement, Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its
reasonable discretion, to obey and comply with all writs, orders or decrees so
entered or issued, which it is advised by legal counsel of its own
choosing is binding upon it, whether with or without jurisdiction, and if
Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall
not be liable to any of the Parties or to any other person, entity, firm or
corporation, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or
decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

14\. _Other Provisions_. Except for changes by a Party of its respective
funds transfer instructions as provided in _Section 12(c)_, the provisions of
this Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or supplemented, in whole or in
part, only by a writing signed by the Parties. Neither this Agreement nor any
right or interest hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part by Escrow
Agent or any Party, except as provided in _Section 6_, without the prior
consent of Escrow Agent and the other Parties. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Texas. Each Party and
Escrow Agent irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum
non-conveniens or similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of
process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable Law and
consents to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Texas or any Texas State court sitting in Dallas, Texas.
To the extent that in any jurisdiction either Party may now or hereafter be
entitled to claim for itself or its assets, immunity from suit, execution
attachment (before or after judgment), or other legal process, such Party
shall not claim, and it hereby irrevocably waives, such immunity. Escrow
Agent and the Parties further hereby waive any right to a trial by jury with
respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this
Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument. All signatures of the Parties to this
Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile, and such facsimile will, for all
purposes, be deemed to be the original signature of such party whose signature
it reproduces, and will be binding upon such party. If any provision of this
Agreement is determined to be prohibited or unenforceable by reason of any
applicable Law, then such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction. A person who is not a
party to this Agreement shall have no right to enforce any term of this
Agreement. The Parties represent, warrant, and covenant that each document,
notice, instruction or request provided by such Party to Escrow Agent shall
comply with applicable Laws. Where, however, the conflicting provisions of any
such applicable Law may be waived, they are hereby irrevocably waived by the
Parties to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the end that this
Agreement shall be enforced as written. Nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be construed to give to any person or entity other
than the Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or claim
under or in respect of this Agreement or any funds escrowed hereunder.

 AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals, the covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other fair, adequate and valuable
consideration (including the consideration delivered pursuant to the
Transaction), the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree as follows:

1\. _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_. For a period beginning on the date
hereof and expiring on the two (2) year anniversary of the Closing (the "
_Restricted Period_ "), the Restricted Party acknowledges and agrees that it
shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly
through any Person or contractual arrangement:

(a) engage in any gas gathering, processing, fractionation or liquid
hydrocarbon business anywhere in the Territory that is of the kind of the
businesses currently operated or currently intended by the Company to be
operated by the Company (the " _Restricted Business_ "), or perform
management, executive or supervisory functions with respect to, own, operate,
join, control, render financial assistance to, receive any economic
benefit from, exert any influence upon, participate in, render services or
advice to, or as applicable and within its control, allow any of its officers
or employees to be connected as an officer, employee, partner, member,
stockholder, consultant or otherwise with, any business or Person that
competes in whole or in part with the Restricted Business;

(b) solicit, recruit or hire any person who at any time after the date of the
Contribution Agreement becomes a Transferred Employee; _provided that_ the
foregoing shall not prohibit the Restricted Party or any of its Affiliates
from (A) hiring a Transferred Employee who responds to a general solicitation
to the public of general advertising or similar methods of solicitation by
search firms not specifically directed at Transferred Employees or (B)
soliciting, recruiting or hiring any Transferred Employee who has ceased to
be employed or retained by the Company, Acquirer or any of their respective
Affiliates for at least twelve (12) months; or

(c) approach or seek business in the Territory constituting the Restricted
Business from any Customer (as hereinafter defined), refer business in the
Territory constituting the Restricted Business from any Customer to any
Person or be paid commissions based on sales from business in the Territory
constituting the Restricted Business received from any Customer by any Person
(it being understood that, for purposes of this _Section 1(c)_, the term "
_Customer_ " means any Person to which the Company provided products or
services during the twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing Date;
_provided that_ the foregoing shall not prohibit any referral of business by
the Restricted Party to the Company or Acquirer.

(d) For purposes hereof, " _Territory_ " means and includes Pennsylvania
(except the Utica Shale in the Counties of Lawrence, Mercer, Crawford and
Erie) and West Virginia.

2.  _Exceptions_.

Notwithstanding _Section 1_ to the contrary, nothing herein shall be deemed
to prohibit: 

 



2 (a) the Restricted Party from owning less than five percent (5%) of any class
of securities traded on a national stock exchange issued by any Person
engaged in the Restricted Business;

(b) the Restricted Party from acquiring the equity securities or assets of
any Person of which less than twenty percent (20%) of its revenues are
attributable to the Restricted Business; and

 

(c) the Restricted Party from conducting and continuing its business
operations of the kind currently conducted (including fulfillment of existing
obligations under contracts currently in effect) in the Counties of Greene,
Fayette, Somerset, Bedford, Indiana, Clearfield, Cambria and Blair in
Pennsylvania and Preston County in West Virginia.

 

3\. _Enforceability and Breaches_.

(a) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this Agreement are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the Parties that these
provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose only
those restrictions on the Restricted Partys conduct that are reasonable in
light of the circumstances and as are necessary to assure to Acquirer the
benefits of this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall
refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants of this Agreement because
taken together they are more extensive than necessary to assure to Acquirer
the intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and
agreed by the Parties that the provisions of this Agreement that, if
eliminated or reformed, would permit the remaining separate provisions to be
enforced in such proceeding, shall be deemed eliminated or reformed as the
case may be, for the purposes of such proceeding, from this Agreement.

(b) Each Party acknowledges any breach by the Restricted Party of any
provision of this Agreement may result in irreparable injury to Acquirer. The
Restricted Party acknowledges that, in the event of such a breach, in addition
to all other remedies available at Law, Acquirer shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including injunctive relief, as well as such other remedies
as may be available at law and equity. The Restricted Party has independently
consulted with its counsel and after such consultation agrees that the
covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable and proper to protect the
legitimate interest of Acquirer.

 

4\. _Amendments and Waivers_.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each Party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by
the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

(b) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege in connection with this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights and remedies
provided in this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by Law.

 



3 5\. _Notices._ All notices, requests and other communications to any Party
pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing (including facsimile
transmission) and shall be given,

Otherwise, any such notice, request or communication shall be deemed not to
have been received until the next succeeding Business Day.

6\. _Successors and Assigns; Assignment_. All of the terms of this Agreement
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by and
against the Restricted Party and its 

 



4  successors and permitted assigns, _provided that_ no Party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of each other Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Acquirer may assign any of its rights and obligations hereunder (a)
to one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries or parent entities of Acquirer
(including any subsidiaries or parent entities which may be organized
subsequent to the date hereof), (b) to any successor of Acquirer, and (c) in
connection with a sale of capital stock, a sale of assets, a merger or other
disposition involving Acquirer, the Company or their respective Affiliates. 

7\. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law of the State of Texas, without regard to the
conflicts of law rules thereof.

8\. _Consent to Jurisdiction_. The Parties agree that any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be brought in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Texas or any Texas State court sitting in Dallas,
Texas, so long as one of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction
over such suit, action or proceeding, and that any cause of action arising out
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have arisen from a transaction of
business in the State of Texas, and each Party hereby irrevocably consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process
in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in
the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such court.
Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of process on
such Party as provided in _Section 5_ shall be deemed effective service of
process on such Party.

9\. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
may be signed in any number of counterparts (including facsimile and
electronic transmission counterparts), each of which shall be an original,
with the same effect as if the signatures to this Agreement were upon the
same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall
have received a counterpart of this Agreement signed by the other Parties. No
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

10\. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among
the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and
written, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this
Agreement.

11\. _Construction_. The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or
otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions hereof. In this Agreement,
the term "including" and words of similar import mean "including, without
limitation," unless the context requires otherwise. Each Party and its or his
counsel have participated in the drafting of this Agreement, the language
used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the
Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of construction to the
effect that any ambiguities shall be resolved against the drafting party
shall be used to interpret this Agreement.

any Person of which less than twenty percent (20%) of its revenues are
attributable to the Restricted Business.

 



2 3\. _Enforceability and Breaches_.

 

(a) If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the character,
duration or geographical scope of the provisions of this Agreement are
unreasonable, it is the intention and the agreement of the Parties that these
provisions shall be construed by the court in such a manner as to impose only
those restrictions on the Restricted Partys conduct that are reasonable in
light of the circumstances and as are necessary to assure to Acquirer the
benefits of this Agreement. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court shall
refuse to enforce all of the separate covenants of this Agreement because
taken together they are more extensive than necessary to assure to Acquirer
the intended benefits of this Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed
by the Parties that the provisions of this Agreement that, if eliminated or
reformed, would permit the remaining separate provisions to be enforced in
such proceeding, shall be deemed eliminated or reformed as the case may be,
for the purposes of such proceeding, from this Agreement.

(b) Each Party acknowledges any breach by the Restricted Party of any
provision of this Agreement may result in irreparable injury to Acquirer. The
Restricted Party acknowledges that, in the event of such a breach, in
addition to all other remedies available at Law, Acquirer shall be entitled to
seek equitable relief, including injunctive relief, as well as such other
remedies as may be available at law and equity. The Restricted Party
has independently consulted with its counsel and after such consultation
agrees that the covenants set forth in this Agreement are reasonable and
proper to protect the legitimate interest of Acquirer.

 

4\. _Amendments and Waivers_.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each Party to this Agreement, or in the case of a waiver, by
the Party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

(b) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege in connection with this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights and remedies
provided in this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights
or remedies provided by Law.

5\. _Notices._ All notices, requests and other communications to any Party

6\. _Successors and Assigns; Assignment_. All of the terms of this Agreement
shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
and against the Restricted Party and its successors and permitted assigns,

State court sitting in Dallas, Texas, so long as one of such courts shall

arisen from a transaction of business in the State of Texas, and each Party
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party
agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in  _Section 5_
shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.

9\. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
may be signed in any number of counterparts (including facsimile and
electronic transmission counterparts), each of which shall be an original,
with the same effect as if the signatures to this Agreement were upon the
same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall
have received a counterpart of this Agreement signed by the other Parties. No
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations, or liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

10\. _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

11\. _Construction_. The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and shall in no way restrict or
otherwise modify any of the terms or provisions hereof. In this Agreement, the
term "including" and words of similar import mean "including, without
limitation," unless the context requires otherwise. Each Party and its or his
counsel have participated in the drafting of this Agreement, the language used
in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to
express their mutual intent, and no rule of construction to the effect that
any ambiguities shall be resolved against the drafting party shall be used to
interpret this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

Section 2.01. _Registration_. 

(a) At any time after the Lock-Up End Date that the Registrable Securities
then held by Unitholder have not ceased to be Registrable Securities, at
Unitholders election and within 15 Business Days after the Partnerships
receipt of Unitholders written request (which written request may be
submitted as early as 15 Business Days prior to the Lock-Up End Date) (an
"Underwritten Offering Request"), the Partnership will (i) if the Partnership
is then a Well Known Seasoned Issuer (as such term is defined under the
Securities Act) with an existing effective Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement at the time of receipt of the Underwritten Offering Request, use its
reasonable best efforts to file a prospectus supplement that shall be deemed
to be part of an existing effective Automatic Shelf Registration Statement
of the Partnership in accordance with Rule 430B under the Securities Act that
is useable for a resale of Registrable Securities by Unitholder conducted
pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting (an "Underwritten Offering"),
or (ii) if the Partnership does not have an existing effective Automatic
Shelf Registration Statement, file and use its reasonable best efforts to have
declared effective by the SEC a Registration Statement containing a prospectus
supplement that is useable for a resale of Registrable Securities by
Unitholder conducted pursuant to an Underwritten Offering; _provided_ ,
_however_ that in no event shall the Partnership be required to file a
prospectus supplement or Registration Statement (as applicable) or otherwise
participate in more than a total of four Underwritten Offerings during the
term of this Agreement or more than one Underwritten Offering in any six-month
period. The Underwritten Offering Request will specify the aggregate value of
the Registrable Securities proposed by Unitholder to be included in such
Underwritten Offering (calculated based on the volume-weighted average trading
price of the Common Units 

 



4  for the 30 days prior to the date of the Underwritten Offering Request),
which aggregate value may not be less than $100 million or more than $275
million. Unitholder may change the number of Registrable Securities proposed
to be offered in any Underwritten Offering at any time prior to commencement
of such offering so long as such change would not materially adversely affect
the timing or success of the Underwritten Offering or change the aggregate
value of the Registrable Securities proposed by Unitholder to be included in
such Underwritten Offering to less than $100 million or more than $275 million
and provided that the Partnership shall be entitled to reasonably delay
an Underwritten Offering as a result of such change. Unitholder will be
permitted to rescind an Underwritten Offering Request at any time prior to 10
Business Days before the public announcement of the Underwritten Offering;
_provided_ , that (i) Unitholder reimburses the Partnership for all
reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Partnership in connection
with such Underwritten Offering, (ii) such Underwritten Offering will not
count as an Underwritten Offering for purposes of determining when future
Underwritten Offerings may be requested by Unitholder pursuant to this Section
2.01(a), and (iii) Unitholder will not be entitled to submit an Underwritten
Offering Request during the two months following the date of the rescission.
In addition, any Underwritten Offering will not count against such number of
Underwritten Offerings if (A) such offering is withdrawn (other than at the
request of Unitholder) or (B) less than 80% of the Registrable Securities
requested by Unitholder to be sold in such Underwritten Offering are sold.

(b) The Partnership will use its reasonable best efforts (i) to cause any
Registration Statement to be declared effective (unless it becomes effective
automatically upon filing) as promptly as practicable after the filing thereof
with the SEC and (ii) to keep any Registration Statement current and
effective until the completion of the Underwritten Offering registered
thereon. The Partnership further agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
supplement or make amendments to each such Registration Statement as may be
necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for the period
referred to above, including (A) to respond to the comments of the SEC, if
any, (B) as may be required by the registration form utilized by
the Partnership for such Registration Statement or by the instructions to
such registration form, (C) as may be required by the Securities Act, (D) as
may be reasonably requested in writing by Unitholder or any Underwriter and
reasonably acceptable to the Partnership. The Partnership agrees to furnish
to Unitholder copies of any such supplement or amendment no later than the
time it is first being used or filed with the SEC.

 

(c) Subject to the following sentence, the Partnership may include in any
Underwritten Offering any securities for its own account or for the account
of holders of Common Units (other than Unitholder). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, if the lead Underwriters of an Underwritten
Offering advise the Partnership in writing that, in their reasonable opinion
the number of Equity Interests (including any Registrable Securities) that
the Partnership, Unitholder and any other persons intend to include in any
Registration Statement is such that the success of any such offering would be
materially and adversely affected, including with respect to the price at
which the securities can be sold, then the number of Common Units or other
Equity Interests to be included in the Registration Statement for the account
of the Partnership, Unitholder and any other persons will be reduced to the
extent necessary to reduce the total number of securities to be included in
any such Registration Statement to the number recommended by such lead
Underwriter; _provided_ , _however_ , that such reduction shall be made: (i)
_first_ , to remove or reduce pro rata among any

 



5  other holders of Common Units or other Equity Interests requested to be
registered or disposed of, as applicable, so that the total number of Equity
Interests to be included in any such offering for the account of all such
persons will not exceed the number recommended by such lead Underwriter, (ii)
_second_ , to remove or reduce any Common Units or other Equity Interests
proposed to be offered by the Partnership for its own account and (iii)
_third_ , to remove or reduce Registrable Securities requested to be included
in the Registration Statement for the account of Unitholder pursuant to
Section 2.01(a).

 

(d) The Partnership and Unitholder agree that it is in the parties interest to
work together to sell the Registrable Securities in an orderly manner. In
this regard, the Partnership may, in its sole discretion, inform Unitholder of
any primary offerings of its Common Units and, to the extent practicable in
the sole discretion of the Partnership, and subject to Unitholder being bound
by a confidentiality agreement containing a restriction on any purchase or
sale of Common Units until such offering is publicly announced, the
Partnership may offer to Unitholder the opportunity to include Registrable
Securities in such offering to allow for the orderly sale of such Units.

Section 2.02. _Registration Procedures_. Subject to the provisions of Section
2.01, in connection with the registration of the sale of Registrable
Securities in an Underwritten Offering pursuant to this Agreement, the
Partnership will as promptly as reasonably practicable:

 

(a) furnish to Unitholder without charge, prior to the filing of a
Registration Statement, copies of such Registration Statement as it
is proposed to be filed, and thereafter such number of copies of such
Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each case
including all exhibits thereto, including each preliminary prospectus), copies
of any and all transmittal letters or other correspondence with the SEC
relating to such Registration Statement and such other documents in such
quantities as Unitholder may reasonably request from time to time in order to
facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities, and give
Unitholder and its Representatives a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the same prior to filing any such documents;

(b) (i) cause the Partnerships Representatives to supply all information
reasonably requested by Unitholder, any Underwriter, or its Representatives in
connection with the Registration Statement and (ii) provide Unitholder, any
Underwriter and its Representatives with the opportunity to participate in the
preparation of such Registration Statement and the related Prospectus;

 

(c) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable
Securities under such other securities or "blue sky" laws of such
jurisdictions as Unitholder reasonably requests and do any and all other acts
and things as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable Unitholder to
consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in
such jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall in no
event be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction
where it is not then so qualified, (ii) subject itself to taxation in
any jurisdiction where is not otherwise then so subject, (iii) take any
action that would subject it to service of process in suits other than those
arising out of the offer and sale of the securities covered by the
Registration Statement or (iv) consent to general service of process in any
jurisdiction where it is not then so subject;

 



6 (d) notify Unitholder at any time when a prospectus relating to Registrable
Securities is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the
happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in a
Registration Statement or the Registration Statement or amendment or
supplement relating to such Registrable Securities contains an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and the
Partnership will promptly prepare and file with the SEC a supplement or
amendment to such prospectus and Registration Statement (and comply fully with
the applicable provisions of Rules 424, 430A and 430B under the Securities Act
in a timely manner) so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
Registrable Securities, such prospectus and Registration Statement will not
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading;

(e) advise any Underwriter(s) and Unitholder promptly and, if requested by
such persons, confirm such advice in writing, of the issuance by the SEC of
any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement
under the Securities Act or of the suspension by any state securities
commission of the qualification of the Registrable Securities for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of any proceeding for any of
the preceding purposes. If at any time the SEC shall issue any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, or any state
securities commission or other regulatory authority shall issue an order
suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of the
Registrable Securities under state securities or "blue sky" laws, the
Partnership shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or
lifting of such order as promptly as practicable; 

(f) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be
registered with or approved by such other Governmental Entities as may be
necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the Partnership to
enable Unitholder to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership shall in no event
be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where
it is not then so qualified, (ii) subject itself to taxation in any
jurisdiction where is not otherwise then so subject, (iii) take any action
that would subject it to service of process in suits other than those arising
out of the offer and sale of the securities covered by the Registration
Statement or (iv) consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction
where it is not then so subject;

(g) enter into customary agreements and use reasonable best efforts to take
such other actions as are reasonably requested by Unitholder and are
consistent with the other obligations of the Partnership hereunder in order to
expedite or facilitate any Underwritten Offering;

(h) if requested by Unitholder, promptly include in any Registration Statement
or Prospectus, pursuant to a supplement or post-effective amendment if
necessary, and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, such information
as Unitholder may reasonably request to have included therein, including any
terms of the Underwritten Offering, and make all required filings of such
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable
after the Partnership is notified of the matters to be included in such
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment;

 



7 (i) except to the extent prohibited by applicable Law and subject to entry
into a customary confidentiality agreement or arrangement, make available,
after reasonable advance notice, for inspection by Unitholder and any of its
Representatives (collectively, the "Inspectors"), during business hours at the
offices where such information is normally kept, any financial and other
records and corporate documents of the Partnership (collectively, the
"Records") as will be reasonably necessary to enable them to conduct
reasonable and customary due diligence with respect to the Partnership and
the related Registration Statement and prospectus and request the
Representatives of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries to supply all
information reasonably requested by any such Inspector; provided,
however, that Records and information obtained hereunder will be used by such
Inspectors only to conduct such due diligence;

(j) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC and make generally available to its security
holders, within the required time period, an earnings statement covering a
period of 12 months, beginning with the first fiscal quarter after the
effective date of the Registration Statement relating to such Registrable
Securities (as the term "effective date" is defined in Rule 158(c) under the
Securities Act), which earnings statement will satisfy the provisions of
Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder or any successor
provisions thereto;

(k) use reasonable best efforts to provide and cause to be maintained a
transfer agent and registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement not later than the effective date of such Registration
Statement;

(l) cooperate with Unitholder and any Underwriter to facilitate the timely
preparation and delivery of certificates representing the Registrable
Securities to be sold under the Registration Statement in a form eligible for
deposit with The Depository Trust Company not bearing any restrictive legends
and not subject to any stop transfer order with any transfer agent, and cause
such Registrable Securities to be issued in such denominations and registered
in such names as the lead Unitholder may request in writing in connection with
the closing of any sale of Registrable Securities; 

(m) use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be
listed or quoted on the NYSE or, if Common Units are not then listed on the
NYSE, then on such other securities exchange or national quotation system on
which the Common Units are then listed or quoted; and

(n) The Partnership will cooperate with Unitholder and each Underwriter in
effecting any Underwritten Offering as promptly as reasonably practicable
following receipt of an Underwritten Offering Request. The Partnership and
Unitholder shall each be entitled to select one lead Underwriter in connection
with an Underwritten Offering from the list of investment banking firms set
forth on _Exhibit A_ attached hereto, which firms have been pre-approved by
Unitholder and the Partnership. The Partnership shall reasonably assist such
managing Underwriter or Underwriters in their efforts to sell Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Underwritten Offering and, if reasonably requested
in connection therewith, shall make senior executives with appropriate
seniority and expertise reasonably available for customary "road show" or
other presentations during the marketing period for such Registrable
Securities (with an 

 



8  understanding that these shall be scheduled in a collaborative manner so as
not to unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the
Partnership). In furtherance of the foregoing, the Partnership will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to each Underwriter and
Unitholder a comfort letter from the independent registered public accounting
firm for the Partnership (and additional comfort letters from the independent
registered public accounting firm for any company acquired by the Partnership
whose financial statements are included or incorporated by reference in the
Registration Statement) in customary form and covering such matters as
are customarily covered by comfort letters as such Underwriter and Unitholder
may reasonably request. The Partnership will use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain and deliver to each Underwriter and Unitholder a 10b-5 statement and
legal opinion from the Partnerships counsel in customary form and covering
such matters as are customarily covered by 10b-5 statements and legal opinions
delivered to Underwriters in Underwritten Offerings as such Underwriter and/or
Unitholder may reasonably request.

Section 2.03. _Conditions to Offerings_.

 

(a) The obligations of the Partnership to take the actions contemplated by
Section 2.01 and Section 2.02 with respect to an offering of Registrable
Securities will be subject to the following conditions:

(i) the Partnership may require Unitholder to furnish to the Partnership such
information regarding Unitholder, the Registrable Securities or the
distribution of such Registrable Securities as the Partnership may from time
to time reasonably request in writing, in each case to the extent reasonably
required by the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or under state securities or "blue sky" laws; and

 

(ii) Unitholder, together with the Partnership and any other holders of the
Partnerships securities proposing to include securities in any Underwritten
Offering, will enter into a customary underwriting agreement with the
Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such underwriting, as well as such
other documents customary in similar offerings.

 

(b) Unitholder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Partnership of
the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 2.02(d) or
2.02(e) or a condition described in Section 2.04, Unitholder will forthwith
discontinue disposition of such Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Registration Statement covering the sale of such Registrable Securities until
Unitholders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus
contemplated by Section 2.02(d) or notice from the Partnership of the
termination of the stop order or Suspension Period.

 

Section 2.04. _Suspension Period_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
the Partnership determines in good faith (because of the existence of, or in
anticipation of, any acquisition, financing activity or other transaction
involving the Partnership, the unavailability of any required financial
statements, disclosure of information which is in its best interest not to
publicly disclose, or any other event or condition of similar significance to
the Partnership) that

 



9  effecting an Underwritten Offering would be materially detrimental to the
Partnership or the holders of its Common Units, then the Partnership shall be
entitled to postpone any such Underwritten Offering for a reasonable period
of time not to exceed 60 consecutive days (or a longer period of time with the
prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) or 105 days in the aggregate in any 365-day period (a "Suspension
Period"). In the event of any such suspension pursuant to this Section
2.04(a), the Partnership shall furnish to Seller a written notice setting
forth the estimated length of the anticipated delay. The Partnership will
notify Unitholder promptly upon the termination of the Suspension Period. Upon
notice by the Partnership to Unitholder of any determination to commence a
Suspension Period, Unitholder shall, except as required by applicable Law,
including any disclosure obligations under Section 13 of the Exchange Act,
keep the fact of any such Suspension Period strictly confidential, and during
any Suspension Period, promptly halt any offer, sale (including sales pursuant
to Rule 144), trading or transfer of any Common Units for the duration of the
Suspension Period until the Partnership has provided notice that the
Suspension Period has been terminated.

(b) After the expiration of any Suspension Period and without any further
request from a holder of Equity Interests, the Partnership shall as promptly
as reasonably practicable prepare a Registration Statement or post-effective
amendment or supplement to the applicable shelf Registration Statement or
Prospectus, or any document incorporated therein by reference, or file any
other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the
Registrable Securities included therein, the Prospectus will not include a
material misstatement or omission or be not effective and useable for resale
of Registrable Securities.

 

Section 2.05. _Registration Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred by
Unitholder applicable to Registrable Securities offered for Unitholders
account in an Underwritten Offering (including underwriting discounts and
commissions and fees and expenses of Unitholders counsel) will be borne by
Unitholder. All other reasonable fees and expenses incident to an
Underwritten Offering, including all fees and expenses incurred by the
Partnership in complying with securities or "blue sky" laws, printing
expenses, messenger and delivery expenses, any registration or filing fees
payable under any federal or state securities or "blue sky" laws, the fees
and expenses incurred in connection with any listing or quoting of the
securities to be registered on any national securities exchange or automated
quotation system, fees of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the Partnership, its
independent registered certified public accounting firm and any other public
accountants who are required to deliver comfort letters (including the
expenses required by or incident to such performance), transfer taxes, fees of
transfer agents and registrars, costs of insurance, the fees and out of pocket
expenses of other persons retained by the Partnership (collectively,
the "Offering Expenses") will be borne (i) in the event the Underwritten
Offering includes only Registrable Securities offered for Unitholders
account, by Unitholder, and (ii) in the event the Underwritten
Offering includes Registrable Securities offered for Unitholders account and
Common Units offered for the Partnerships own account or for the account of
holders of Common Units other than Unitholder, 50% by Unitholder and 50% by
the Partnership,  _provided,_ in the case of (ii), if less than 50% of the
total amount of Common Units offered in the Underwritten Offering are offered
for Unitholders account, then the Offering Expenses for such Underwritten
Offering will be borne by Unitholder and the Partnership _pro rata,_ based on
the percentage of the total amount of Common Units offered for Unitholders
account and the percentage of the total amount of Common Units offered for the
Partnerships own account or for the account of holders of Common Units other
than Unitholder.

 



10 Section 2.06. _Indemnification; Contribution_. (a) In connection with any
registration of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 2.01, the
Partnership will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Unitholder, its
Affiliates, directors, officers and shareholders and each person who controls
Unitholder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the "Indemnified Persons") from
and against any and all Losses caused by any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of material fact contained in any part of any Registration
Statement or any Prospectus, including any amendment or supplement thereto,
used in connection with the Registrable Securities or any Issuer FWP, or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a
prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Partnership will not be
required to indemnify any Indemnified Person for any Losses resulting from any
such untrue statement or omission if such untrue statement or omission was
made in reliance on and in conformity with information with respect to any
Indemnified Person furnished to the Partnership in writing by, or at direction
of, Unitholder or any Indemnified Person expressly for use therein.

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement, Prospectus or Issuer FWP,
Unitholder will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Partnership, its
directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls the Partnership
(within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the
Partnership to Unitholder, but only with respect to information furnished to
the Partnership in writing by, or at direction of, any Unitholder or any
Indemnified Persons expressly for use in such Registration Statement,
Prospectus or Issuer FWP.

 

(c) In case any claim, action or proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) is instituted involving any person in respect of which
indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 2.06(a) or Section 2.06(b), such
person (the "Indemnified Party") will promptly notify the person against whom
such indemnity may be sought (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing and the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent
it shall wish, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and will pay the fees and disbursements
of such counsel related to such proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure or delay to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement except to the extent
such Indemnifying Party has been prejudiced by such failure or delay. In any
such claim, action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right,
but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to retain its
own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense
of such Indemnified Party unless (i) the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii)
the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of the claim, action or
proceeding within 15 Business Days following receipt of notice from the
Indemnified Party, or (iii) the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
are both actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such action
and the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that representation of
both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential conflicting interests between them. It is understood that
the Indemnifying Party will not, in connection with any claim, action or
proceeding or

 



11  related claims, actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable
for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of
attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such
Indemnified Parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be
reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of the retention of any such
separate firm for the Indemnified Parties, such firm will be designated
in writing by the Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party will not be
liable for any settlement of any claim, action or proceeding effected without
its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), but if such claim, action or proceeding is settled
with such consent or if there has been a final judgment for the plaintiff, the
Indemnifying Party agrees to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against
any Loss by reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Party
will, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle,
compromise or offer to settle or compromise any pending or threatened
proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is seeking
indemnity hereunder, unless such settlement includes (i) an unconditional
release of such Indemnified Party from all liability in connection with such
proceeding, (ii) no finding or admission of any violation of Law or any
violation of the rights of any person by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates can be made as the result of such action, and (iii) the sole relief
(if any) provided is monetary damages that are reimbursed in full by the
Indemnifying Party. No Indemnified Party will, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any
Indemnified Party is seeking indemnity hereunder.

 

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 2.06 from the
Indemnifying Party is unavailable to an Indemnified Party hereunder or is
insufficient in respect of any Losses referred to in this Section 2.06, then
the Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, will
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as
a result of such Losses (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party in
connection with the actions that resulted in such Losses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations, or (ii) if the allocation provided by
clause (i) is not permitted by applicable Law, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault referred to in clause (i)
but also the relative benefit of the Partnership, on the one hand, and
Unitholder, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that
resulted in such Losses, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any
action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has
been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party
or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of the Losses referred to above will be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.06(c),
any reasonable legal or other out of pocket fees or expenses reasonably
incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.

(e) The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to Section 2.06(d) were determined by _pro rata_ allocation or by
any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable
considerations referred to in Section 2.06(d). No person guilty of
"fraudulent misrepresentation" (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent

 



12  misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 2.06(e),
Unitholder shall not be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount
in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by Unitholder from
the sale of the Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which
Unitholder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

(f) If indemnification is available under this Section 2.06, the Indemnifying
Party will indemnify each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permissible
under applicable Law provided in Sections 2.06(a) and 2.06(b) without regard
to the relative fault of said Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party or any
other equitable consideration provided for in Section 2.06(d) or Section
2.06(e). The obligations of the Partnership under this Section 2.06 shall be
in addition to any liability that the Partnership may otherwise have to any
Indemnified Person.

 

Section 2.07. _Rule 144_.

(a) The Partnership agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to
file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and take such further action as Unitholder reasonably may
request (including providing Unitholder with such information as may be
required in order to enable Unitholder to make sales within the limitation of
the exemptions provided by Rule 144), all to the extent required from time to
time to enable Unitholder to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to the
exemptions provided by Rule 144.

(b) Seller and the Partnership agree that Seller and its Affiliates shall not
be deemed an affiliate of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries under
Rule 144 for purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.08. _Transfer of Registration Rights_. The rights granted to
Unitholder under this Article II may not be assigned by Unitholder in whole
or in part other than to any person that acquires all of Unitholders
Registrable Securities; _provided_ that the Partnership approves such transfer
in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

ARTICLE III

LOCK-UP; CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS

Section 3.01. _Lock-Up_. Unitholder agrees that the Units are subject to the
restrictions on transfer set forth in Section 5.14 of the Purchase Agreement.

Section 3.02. _Transfer Agent_. Seller and the Partnership agree that the
Partnership may cause the transfer agent or other registrar to enter stop
transfer instructions and implement stop transfer procedures with respect to
any transfer of Units not in compliance with Section 3.01. Any transfer or
attempted transfer of Units in violation of Section 3.01, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, be null and void _ab initio_.

Section 3.03. _Legends_. Any certificates for Units issued to Unitholder shall
bear a legend or legends (and appropriate comparable notations or other
arrangements will be made with respect to any uncertificated units)
referencing restrictions on transfer of such Units under the Securities Act
and under this Agreement which legend shall state in substance:

 



13 "The securities evidenced by this certificate have been issued and sold
without registration under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any state of the
United States (a "State Act") in reliance upon certain exemptions
from registration under said acts. The securities evidenced by this
certificate cannot be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred within the
United States unless such sale, assignment or other transfer is (i) made
pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act and
in accordance with each applicable State Act or (ii) exempt from, or not
subject to, the Securities Act and each applicable State Act. If the proposed
sale, assignment or other transfer within the United States will be made
pursuant to clause (ii) above, the holder must, prior to such sale, assignment
or other transfer, furnish to the issuer such customary certifications, legal
opinions and other information as the issuer may reasonably require to
determine that such sale, assignment or other transfer is being made in
accordance with such clause.

The securities evidenced by this certificate are subject to restrictions on
transfer set forth in a Contribution Agreement dated as of March [__], 2012,
between the Partnership and Caiman Energy, LLC (a copy of which is on file
with the Secretary of the general partner of the Partnership)."

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of any certificate(s) for Units
shall be entitled to receive from the Partnership new certificates for a like
number of Units not bearing such legend (or the elimination or termination of
such notations or arrangements) upon the request of such holder at (i) such
time as such restrictions are no longer applicable, and (ii) with respect to
the restriction on transfer of such Units under the Securities Act, delivery
of a customary opinion of counsel to such holder, which opinion is reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to the Partnership and its counsel, that
the restriction referenced in such legend (or such notations or arrangements)
is no longer required in order to ensure compliance with the Securities Act.

 

Section 3.04. _Section 16 Matters_. Seller shall comply in all material
respects with the beneficial ownership reporting requirements under Section
16 of the Exchange Act, as such requirements may apply to its beneficial
ownership of Common Units.

Section 3.05. _Information_. Seller agrees to use its reasonable best efforts
to provide the Partnership with any information requested by the Partnership
regarding Sellers consummated or planned sales of Units pursuant to this
agreement or, to the extent known by Seller, the consummated or planned sales
activity of Sellers affiliates.

Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
person, other than the parties and their respective permitted successors and

Delaware limited liability company _OR_ Williams Partners L.P., a Delaware
limited partnership (" _Acquirer_ ")]. Contributor and Acquirer are each
sometimes referred to herein each as a " _party_ " and collectively, as the "
_parties_ ". Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined shall
have the meanings assigned such terms in the Contribution Agreement (as
defined below).

 

RECITALS:

 

A. Contributor and Acquirer have entered into that certain Contribution
Agreement (the " _Contribution Agreement_ "), dated as of March [__], 2012,

") all on the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth in the
Contribution Agreement.

B. In connection with the transactions contemplated by the Contribution
Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
parties agree that Contributor will provide Acquirer with such transition
services as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate for the ownership and
operation of the business of the Company until the end of the Service Period
(as defined below), and in order to facilitate the transition of such services

services without the aid of Contributor by the end of the Service Period.

AGREEMENT 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing Recitals, the mutual
covenants and agreements set forth herein, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereby agree as follows:

1\. _Term and Services_.

(a) Unless sooner terminated as hereinafter provided, the term of this
Agreement shall commence on the date hereof (" _Effective Date_ ") and
continue for a period of [ _ _]1 months (the " _Initial Service
Period_ "), _provided_ the Service Period can be extended for up to [ _
_] additional successive one-month periods (each such period, an " _Extended
Service Period_ ") by Acquirer giving written notice to Contributor no less
than thirty (30) days prior to the end of the Initial Service Period and no
less than ten (10) days prior to the end of each Extended Service Period. The
period of service by Contributor hereunder whether the Initial Service Period
or the Extended Service Period, or as otherwise extended by mutual agreement,
shall be referred to as the " _Service Period_ ".

 



   1  |

Parties to agree on the service periods prior to Closing. 
 (b) From the Effective Date through the end of the Service Period, subject to
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, Contributor shall provide to
Acquirer the services set forth in _Exhibit A_ attached hereto and
incorporated herein by reference to transition ownership and operation of the
businesses of the Company to Acquirer (the " _Services_ "); _provided that_ ,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Services shall
not include any services to the extent such services were, prior to the
Closing, provided by one or more of the Transferred Employees.

(c) The Services will be provided solely by the employees designated in
_Exhibit B_,  _provided that_ from time to time Acquirer shall have the
right to reduce the number of employees designated to provide the Services by
providing a written notice to Contributor at least ten (10) days prior to the
end of any Service Month (as defined below), with such reduction taking
effect at the end of such Service Month.

(d) The parties agree that  _Exhibit A_ and _Exhibit B_ may be amended by
mutual agreement of the parties from time to time in accordance with _Section
6(g)_.

2\. _Fees, Reimbursable Costs, and Payment_.

(a)  _Fees_. Acquirer shall (i) with respect to the Services rendered during
the Initial Service Period and the first three Extended Service Periods (if
any), pay to Contributor the fully-burdened monthly cost set forth in _Exhibit
B_ for each employee performing the Services for Acquirer hereunder in each
Service Month (based on the allocation of each such employees time to
performing the Services for Acquirer as set forth on _Exhibit B_ , as amended
from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties) and (ii) with respect
to the Services rendered during the Extended Service Periods (if any)
beginning at least [ ]2 months after the Effective Date, pay to
Contributor an amount equal to 1.25 times the fully-burdened monthly cost set
forth in _Exhibit B_ for each employee performing the Services for Acquirer
hereunder in each Service Month (based on the allocation of each such
employees time to performing the Services for Acquirer as set forth on
_Exhibit B_ , as amended from time to time by mutual agreement of the parties)
(collectively the " _Fees_ "). " _Service Month_ " shall mean the period
beginning on the Effective Date and continuing until the end of the current
calendar month, and each successive calendar month thereafter, until the end
of the Service Period. In addition, Acquirer shall pay directly or reimburse
Contributor for any and all out-of-pocket costs incurred by Contributor in
providing the Services.

(b) _Payment_. Contributor shall submit an invoice to Acquirer within ten

underpayments or overpayments attributable to an earlier Service Month) of all
amounts due under _Section 2(a)_ in the prior Service Month and Acquirer
shall pay any undisputed invoice amount within thirty (30) days following the
date of Acquirers receipt thereof from Contributor. Invoices shall include

annum.



   2  |

Parties to agree on this period prior to Closing. 

---|--- 
 



2 (c) _Audit_. Contributor shall, for a period of two (2) years after the
expiration or termination of this Agreement, maintain records and other
evidence sufficient to accurately and properly reflect the performance of the
Services hereunder and the amounts invoiced by Contributor to Acquirer with
respect thereto. Acquirer shall have access at all reasonable times during
such period to examine and obtain (at Acquirers expense) copies of such
records for the purpose of auditing and verifying the accuracy of the invoices
submitted by Contributor regarding the amounts due Contributor.

3\. _Standards for the Provision of Services_.

(a) Contributor shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement, devote to the
performance of the Services the personnel designated pursuant to _Exhibit B_
(as adjusted pursuant to  _Section 1(c)_) and shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such employees of Contributor to continue
providing the Services during the Services Period as long as they are employed
by Contributor.

 

(b) Contributor and Acquirer shall each designate a representative to serve as
the "contract manager" who shall have the responsibility for coordinating the
provision of the Services and the general administration of this Agreement on
behalf of Contributor and Acquirer, respectively. The names of such contract
managers are set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto. 

(c) The Services shall be performed in accordance with applicable Law, and in
a manner and quality that are substantially consistent with Contributors
past practice in performing the Services for the benefit of the Company. Prior
to the commencement of any Services rendered for a Service Month, Contributor
shall submit to Acquirer a plan of the Services to be rendered and scope of
work in or for such Service Month and Contributor shall notify Acquirer of any
material deviation made to such plan during such Service Month. Contributor
shall not be liable or held accountable in damages or otherwise, for
any error of judgment or any mistake of fact or Law or for anything that
Contributor does or refrains from doing in good faith hereunder.

(d) Contributor shall (i) secure (at Acquirers expense) all necessary third-
party consents, permits and governmental approvals required for Contributor to
provide the Services, and (ii) report and pay all Taxes of Contributor,
including payroll, sales, use, excise and occupational taxes, applicable to
the provision of the Services by Contributor hereunder. In addition,
Contributor shall at all times comply with any applicable Permits and Laws
relating to the Services provided hereunder and shall promptly notify Acquirer
upon receiving notice of any investigation or notice regarding any
noncompliance or alleged violation with respect thereto which result
from Contributor providing the Services.

(e) Acquirer shall furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Contributor such
access, information, documentation, services and materials as are reasonably
requested by Contributor to enable Contributor to perform the Services.

(f) In providing the Services, Contributor shall not be obligated to acquire
new, additional, replacement or different personnel, equipment or resources,
or to provide services incidental to or ancillary to the Services.
Contributor may use contractors, subcontractors,

 



3  vendors or other third parties to provide some or all of the Services to be
provided by Contributor; _provided however_ that Contributor shall remain
responsible for the performance of such subcontractor as it Contributor were
performing such services itself.

(g) It is understood and agreed that Contributor is not a professional
provider of the types of services included in the Services. The Services will
not necessarily be uninterrupted or error-free. Contributors obligation
hereunder is to use reasonable efforts to perform the Services effectively
and efficiently and to address any defects in the Services, all within the
constraints of available personnel and other resources. It is understood and
agreed that Contributors personnel performing the Services have other
responsibilities for Contributor and its Affiliates, and will only dedicate
the allocation of time as set forth in _Exhibit B_.

(h) IT IS SPECIFICALLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED BY THE PARTIES THAT THERE ARE NO
WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF SERVICES BY
CONTRIBUTOR HEREUNDER, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED.

(i) Contributor shall not be required to purchase any equipment in order to
provide the Services. If Contributor and Acquirer agree that Contributor will
require additional equipment to provide the Services, (including but not
limited to hardware, software and associated software licensing fees),
Acquirer shall reimburse Contributor at 100% of the actual paid-out costs
incurred by Contributor for such items in accordance with _Section 2(b)_;
_provided that_ upon termination of this Agreement such items shall be
transferred by Contributor to Acquirer.

(j) Neither Contributor nor any of its Affiliates will be required to perform
or to cause to be performed any of the Services for the benefit of any third
party or any Person other than the Company and Acquirer (to the extent
relating to the Companys business).

 



   4. | _Termination of the Services_. 
---|--- 

(a) _Option to Terminate Services_. Acquirer may elect for any reason, by
giving written notice to Contributor at least five (5) Business Days in
advance, to terminate the provision by Contributor of any or all categories
of the Services (set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto) provided to Acquirer;
_provided, however_ , that Acquirer shall remain liable for and shall pay the
Fees accrued until the end of the period agreed upon pursuant to _Section
1(c)_. Contributor shall submit to Acquirer the final invoice for the Services
rendered within sixty (60) days of notice to terminate the Services.

 

(b) _Contributor s Right to Suspend Performance_. Contributor shall have the
right to suspend the performance of the Services under this Agreement if
Acquirer fails to make payments due, owing and not disputed in good faith, to
Contributor as required under this Agreement and such failure has not been
cured within fifteen (15) days after delivery of written notice of such
failure to Acquirer.

 



4 (c) _Effect of Termination_. Applicable provisions of this Agreement shall
survive expiration or early termination of this Agreement to the extent
necessary to enforce or complete the duties, obligations or responsibilities
of the parties arising prior to such expiration or termination and, as
applicable, to provide for final billings related to the period prior to
expiration or termination and indemnification obligations provided in this
Agreement.

5.  _Relationships Among the Parties_. Contributor shall be an independent
contractor with respect to the Services it provides hereunder. Nothing in this
Agreement shall cause the relationship between Contributor and Acquirer or any
of its Affiliates to be deemed to constitute an agency, partnership, or joint
venture, or to cause either of Contributor or Acquirer or any of its
Affiliates to be treated as a co-employer with respect to employees, or to
cause Contributor or any of its Affiliates to have any burdens or obligations
of ownership or similar responsibilities with respect to the Purchased
Interests after the Closing. None of Contributor or any of its respective
officers or employees shall have or hold themselves out as having any right,
power or authority to make any warranty or representation on behalf of
Acquirer, contract for Acquirer, or commit Acquirer to any obligation or
undertaking other than actions taken reasonably by Contributor in connection
with an emergency situation of which Contributor notifies Acquirer within a
reasonable time after its occurrence. The parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the terms of this Agreement and provision of the Services under this
Agreement in no way provide or require that (a) Contributor or any of its
Affiliates in any way sponsor, maintain, contribute to, or have any obligation
(fiduciary or otherwise) with respect to any compensation or any benefit plan,
program, policy and/or arrangement (whether governed by ERISA, securities
laws, or otherwise) with respect to any employees of Acquirer providing the
Services or (b) Acquirer or any of its Affiliates in any way sponsor,
maintain, contribute to, or have any obligation (fiduciary or otherwise) with
respect to any compensation or any benefit plan, program, policy and/or
arrangement (whether governed by ERISA, securities laws, or otherwise) with
respect to any employees of Contributor providing the Services;
_provided that_ Acquirer acknowledges that the fully burdened cost of each
employee performing the Services hereunder includes a component attributable
to the benefits and insurance provided by or on behalf of Contributor to such
employee.

 

6\. _Indemnification and Limitation of Liability_.

(a) For Services provided after the end of the Initial Service Period, subject
to the terms and conditions of this _Section 6_, Acquirer hereby releases and
agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Contributor, its affiliates,

(iii) Where liability with or without fault is imposed or sought to be
imposed, on the basis of any theory of strict liability by operation of law.

(b) IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES THAT THE EXCULPATION, DEFENSE AND

TO PROTECT AND INDEMNIFY THE CONTRIBUTOR INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST
ANY AND ALL LIABILITY ARISING FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT,
INCLUDING LIABILITY BASED ON OR RESULTING FROM THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE, FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY OF THE CONTRIBUTOR INDEMNIFIED PARTIES;
PROVIDED THAT NOTHING HEREIN SHALL PROTECT OR INDEMNIFY A CONTRIBUTOR
INDEMNIFIED PARTY FROM LIABILITY BASED ON OR RESULTING FROM ITS WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT.

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, NONE OF THE
ACQUIRER OR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES SHALL BE ENTITLED TO
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT
