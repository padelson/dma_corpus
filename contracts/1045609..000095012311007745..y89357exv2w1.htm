 (i) _Membership Interests of Pumpkin LLC_. Each membership interest of Pumpkin LLC issued and outstanding immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time shall be automatically converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable common share of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, of the surviving entity of the ProLogis Merger, and such share of beneficial interest of the surviving entity shall be owned by Upper Pumpkin.

Each common share of beneficial interest, par value $0.01 per share, of ProLogis (" _ProLogis Common Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time shall be automatically converted into one newly issued share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of New Pumpkin (" _New Pumpkin Common Stock_ "). As a result of the ProLogis Merger, all ProLogis Common Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously evidencing ProLogis Common Shares shall thereafter represent the shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock into which such ProLogis Common Shares were converted (and, following the Topco Effective Time, shares of AMB Common Stock into which such shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b)).

Pursuant to a share exchange effected by the ProLogis Merger, (A) each ProLogis Series C Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time shall be automatically exchanged for one newly issued share of Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of New Pumpkin (" _New Pumpkin Series C Preferred Stock_"), (B) each ProLogis Series F Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time shall be automatically exchanged for one newly issued share of Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of New Pumpkin (" _New Pumpkin Series F Preferred Stock_") and (C) each ProLogis Series G Preferred Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time shall be automatically exchanged for one newly issued share of Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of New Pumpkin (" _New Pumpkin Series G Preferred Stock_" and, together with the New Pumpkin Series C Preferred Stock and the New Pumpkin Series F Preferred Stock, the 

   ##### 

  

    

" _New Pumpkin Preferred Stock_ "). As a result of such share exchange,
all ProLogis Preferred Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate previously evidencing ProLogis Preferred Shares shall thereafter
represent the shares of New Pumpkin Preferred Stock for which such ProLogis
Preferred Shares were exchanged (and, following the Topco Effective Time,
shares of AMB Preferred Stock into which such shares of New Pumpkin Preferred
Stock have been converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b)). 

   

 (iv) _Conversion of Rights to Redeem or Exchange ProLogis Partnership Units and Rights to Convert Convertible Debt_. Each right of a limited partner in a ProLogis Partnership to redeem or exchange its ProLogis Partnership Units for ProLogis Common Shares (or cash equivalents thereof) pursuant to the partnership agreement of the applicable ProLogis Partnership outstanding immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to redeem or exchange such ProLogis Partnership Units for a number of shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock (or cash equivalents thereof) equal to the number of ProLogis Common Shares that such limited partner would have received if the redemption or exchange occurred immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time, as such number of shares may be adjusted and on the terms pursuant to the agreements governing such ProLogis Partnership Units. Each right of a holder of ProLogiss convertible debt to convert such convertible debt into ProLogis Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time shall be converted into the right to convert such convertible debt into a number of shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock equal to the number of ProLogis Common Shares that such holder would have received if the conversion occurred immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time (as such number of shares may be adjusted and on the terms pursuant to the agreements governing such convertible debt), pursuant to the adoption of a supplemental indenture as contemplated pursuant to Section 5.14.

 (i) _Conversion of New Pumpkin Common Stock and New Pumpkin Preferred Stock_.  Subject to Section 2.2(e), (A) each share of New Pumpkin Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Topco Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive 0.4464 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a newly issued share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AMB (" _AMB Common Stock_ "), (B) each share of New Pumpkin Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Topco Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive one newly issued share of Series Q Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AMB (" _AMB Series Q Preferred Stock_"), (C) each share of New Pumpkin Series F Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Topco Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive one newly issued share of Series R Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of AMB (" _AMB Series R Preferred Stock_"), and (D) each share of New Pumpkin Series G Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Topco Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive one newly issued share of

of AMB (" _AMB Series S Preferred Stock_" and, together with the AMB Series
Q Preferred Stock and the AMB Series R Preferred Stock, the " _AMB New
Preferred Stock_ "). As a result of the Topco Merger, all shares of New
Pumpkin Common Stock and New Pumpkin Preferred Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each ProLogis Certificate shall thereafter represent the right
to receive the shares of AMB Common Stock and AMB New Preferred Stock, as
applicable, into which such shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock and New
Pumpkin Preferred Stock were converted. ProLogis Certificates shall be
exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of AMB Common Stock and
shares of AMB New Preferred Stock, as applicable, issued in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance with
Section 2.2, without interest. 

   

 (ii) _Conversion of Rights to Redeem or Exchange New Pumpkin Partnership Units and Rights to Convert Convertible Debt_. Each right of a limited partner in a ProLogis Partnership to redeem or exchange its ProLogis Partnership Units for shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock (or cash equivalents thereof) pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iv) shall be automatically converted into the right to redeem or exchange such ProLogis Partnership Units for that number of shares of AMB Common Stock (or cash equivalents thereof) equal to the product of the number of shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock that such limited partner would have received if the redemption or exchange occurred immediately prior to the Topco Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, as such number of shares may be adjusted and on the terms pursuant to the agreements governing such ProLogis Partnership Units. Each right of a holder of ProLogiss convertible debt to convert such convertible debt into shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iv) shall be converted into the right to convert such convertible debt into that number of shares of AMB Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock that such holder would have received if the conversion occurred immediately prior to the Topco Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (as such number of shares may be adjusted and on the terms pursuant to the agreements governing such convertible debt), pursuant to the adoption of a supplemental indenture as contemplated pursuant to Section 5.14. 

  

 (c) _AMB Capital Stock_. Each share of AMB Common Stock and AMB Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding following the Topco Effective Time as shares of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

As of the Topco Effective Time, AMB shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by AMB and reasonably acceptable to ProLogis (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form which immediately prior to the Topco Effective Time represented shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock and New Pumpkin Preferred Stock (including certificates formerly evidencing ProLogis Common Shares and ProLogis Preferred Shares as of immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time, and collectively, the " _ProLogis Certificates_ "), for exchange in accordance with this Article II, certificates or, at AMBs option, evidence of 

   ##### 

  

    

shares in book-entry form (collectively " _certificates_ ") representing the
shares of AMB Common Stock and AMB New Preferred Stock issuable pursuant to
Section 2.1 in exchange for such shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock and New
Pumpkin Preferred Stock. Such certificates for shares of AMB Common Stock and
AMB New Preferred Stock so deposited, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_." 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Topco Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock and New Pumpkin Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Topco Effective Time whose shares were converted into the right to receive shares of AMB Common Stock and AMB New Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the ProLogis Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the ProLogis Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in such form and have such other provisions as AMB and ProLogis may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the ProLogis Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of AMB Common Stock and AMB New Preferred Stock. Upon surrender of a ProLogis Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as the Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the holder of such ProLogis Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of AMB Common Stock and AMB New Preferred Stock which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the ProLogis Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II (after taking into account all shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock and New Pumpkin Preferred Stock then held by such holder), and the ProLogis Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of ProLogis Common Shares or ProLogis Preferred Shares which is not registered in the transfer records of ProLogis or a transfer of ownership of New Pumpkin Common Stock or New Pumpkin Preferred Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of New Pumpkin, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of AMB Common Stock and AMB New Preferred Stock, as applicable, may be issued to a transferee if the ProLogis Certificate representing the applicable New Pumpkin Common Stock or New Pumpkin Preferred Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each ProLogis Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Topco Effective Time to represent only the right to receive AMB Common Stock or AMB New Preferred Stock into which the shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock and New Pumpkin Preferred Stock represented by such ProLogis Certificate have been converted as provided in this Article II and the right to receive upon such surrender cash in lieu of any fractional shares of AMB Common Stock as provided in this Section 2.2. 

  

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to AMB Common Stock or AMB New Preferred Stock with a record date after the Topco Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered ProLogis Certificate with respect to the shares of AMB Common Stock or AMB New Preferred Stock, as the case may be, represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.2(e), until the holder of 

   ##### 

  

    

such ProLogis Certificate shall surrender such ProLogis Certificate. Subject
to the effect of applicable Laws, following the surrender of any such
ProLogis Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of AMB Common Stock or AMB New Preferred Stock
issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such
surrender the amount of any cash payable with respect to a fractional share
of AMB Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
2.2(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Topco Effective Time theretofore paid (but withheld pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence) with respect to such whole shares of AMB
Common Stock or AMB New Preferred Stock, as the case may be, and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Topco Effective Time but prior to surrender and a
payment date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole shares
of AMB Common Stock or AMB New Preferred Stock, as the case may be. 

  

 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights_. All shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock and New Pumpkin Preferred Stock issued upon conversion of ProLogis Common Shares and ProLogis Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, and all shares of AMB Common Stock and AMB New Preferred Stock issued upon conversion of shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock and New Pumpkin Preferred Stock (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.2(c) or 2.2(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such ProLogis Common Shares and ProLogis Preferred Shares and such shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock and New Pumpkin Preferred Shares, respectively; _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the ProLogis Effective Time which may have been declared or made by ProLogis or New Pumpkin on such ProLogis Common Shares or ProLogis Preferred Shares or shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock or New Pumpkin Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement on or prior to the ProLogis Effective Time and which remain unpaid at the ProLogis Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the ProLogis Common Shares and ProLogis Preferred Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to the ProLogis Effective Time or of the shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock or New Pumpkin Preferred Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Topco Effective Time. If, after the Topco Effective Time, ProLogis Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

  

 (e) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of AMB Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of ProLogis Certificates representing New Pumpkin Common Stock, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation. In lieu thereof, upon surrender of the applicable ProLogis Certificates, AMB shall pay each holder of New Pumpkin Common Stock an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock held at the Topco Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled by (ii) the closing price on the NYSE, as reported on the consolidated tape at the close of the NYSE regular session of trading, for a share of AMB Common Stock on the last trading day immediately preceding the Topco Effective Time. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the stockholders of New Pumpkin for nine months after the Topco Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any stockholders of New Pumpkin who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claim for AMB Common Stock or AMB New Preferred Stock and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of AMB Common Stock. 

  

 (g) _No Liability_. None of AMB, ProLogis, New Pumpkin or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of shares of ProLogis Common Shares, ProLogis Preferred Shares, New Pumpkin Common Stock or New Pumpkin Preferred Stock for shares of AMB Common Stock or AMB New Preferred Stock (or dividends or other distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (h) _Withholding_. AMB shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock or New Pumpkin Preferred Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by AMB, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock or New Pumpkin Preferred Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by AMB. 

  

 2.3. _Structure_. Each party hereto shall cooperate with and agree to any reasonable changes requested by the other parties regarding the structure of the transactions contemplated herein (including with respect to the restructuring transactions set forth in Section 2.3 of the ProLogis Disclosure Letter), which cooperation shall include entering into appropriate amendments to this Agreement; _provided_ that any such changes do not have an adverse effect on either the holders of the AMB Common Stock, AMB Preferred Stock, ProLogis Common Shares or ProLogis Preferred Shares, or on the Surviving Corporation being structured as an UPREIT, including any adverse effect on the expected time by which the Mergers shall be consummated. 

  

 2.4. _Further Assurances_. If at any time following the Topco Effective Time the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances or any other acts or things are necessary, desirable or proper (a) to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of any party hereto, or (b) otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the Surviving Corporation and its proper officers and directors or their designees shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of any such Person, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to do, in the name and on behalf of any such Person, all such other acts and things as may be necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, privileges, powers, franchises, properties or assets of such party and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.5. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If, at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Topco Effective Time, there is a change in the number of issued and outstanding ProLogis Common Shares, shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock or shares of AMB Common Stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into ProLogis Common Shares or shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock or shares of AMB Common Stock, in each case, as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including reverse stock split), stock dividend or stock distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer or other similar transaction, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

  

 2.6. _Lost Certificates_. If any ProLogis Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such ProLogis Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if requested by AMB, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as AMB may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such ProLogis Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section 2.2(f), the Surviving Corporation) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed ProLogis Certificate, the shares of AMB Common Stock or AMB New Preferred Stock, as applicable, into which such shares of New Pumpkin Common Stock or New Pumpkin Preferred Stock were converted pursuant to Section 2.1(b), any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends and distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 5.1. _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings_. (a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate in preparing and shall cause to be filed with the SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials which shall constitute the proxy statement/prospectus relating to the matters to be submitted to the AMB stockholders at the AMB Stockholders Meeting and to the ProLogis shareholders at the ProLogis Shareholders Meeting (such joint proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and AMB (and, if required, New Pumpkin) shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (of which the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be a part) with respect to the issuance of AMB Common 

      ##### 

  

    

Stock in the Topco Merger (and, if required, with respect to the issuance of
the New Pumpkin Common Stock in the Pumpkin Merger) (such Form S-4, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Form S-4_"). Each of the parties
hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective by
the SEC and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Topco Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. AMB
and ProLogis shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof, provide
the other party with copies of any written comments and advise the
other party of any oral comments with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. Each party shall
cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the
SEC, and each party will provide the other party with a copy of all such
filings made with the SEC. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take any action required to be taken under any applicable state securities
laws in connection with the Mergers, and each party shall furnish all
information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock or shares of

AMB Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale
in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4. If, at any time prior to
the Topco Effective Time, any information relating to either of the parties,
or their respective affiliates, officers, trustees or directors, should be
discovered by either party, and such information should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that such documents would not include any misstatement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other party hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules

information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.1(b), if, on a date for which the AMB Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, AMB has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of AMB Common Stock to obtain the AMB Required Vote, whether or not a quorum is present, AMB shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the AMB Stockholders Meeting;  _provided_ that the AMB Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which the AMB Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjourn- 

   ##### 

  

 

ments or postponements required by applicable Law). Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be deemed to relieve AMB of its obligation to submit the
Topco Merger to its stockholders for a vote on the approval thereof. AMB
agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1, its obligations to hold the AMB Stockholders Meeting
pursuant to this Section 5.1(b) shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to AMB of any Acquisition
Proposal or by any Change in AMB Recommendation.

Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve ProLogis of its obligation to submit the Mergers to its shareholders for a vote on the approval thereof. ProLogis agrees that, unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, its obligations to hold the ProLogis Shareholders Meeting pursuant to this Section 5.1(c) shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to ProLogis of any Acquisition Proposal or by any Change in ProLogis Recommendation.

Neither party nor 

      ##### 

  

    

any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the
rights of its customers, jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information or contravene any
law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties will make appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the
restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. 

   

 (b) The parties will hold any such information which is nonpublic in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the letter dated December 31, 2010, between AMB and ProLogis (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement will remain in full force and effect.

AMB or ProLogis, as applicable, shall provide the other with a copy of any nonpublic information or data provided to a third party pursuant to the prior sentence prior to or simultaneously with furnishing such information to such third party.

 (iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, the Board of Directors of AMB or Board of Trustees of ProLogis, as applicable, may make a Change in AMB Recommendation or a Change in ProLogis Recommendation, as applicable, if and only if (A) an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.4) is made to AMB or ProLogis, as applicable, by a third party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (B) the Board of Directors of AMB or the Board of Trustees of ProLogis, as applicable, has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (C) the directors of AMB or the trustees of ProLogis, as applicable, have concluded in good faith (after consultation with their outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with their duties under applicable Law, (D) five Business Days shall have elapsed since the party proposing to take such action has given written notice to the other party advising such other party that the notifying party intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action (a " _Notice of Recommendation Change_ ") (it being understood that any amendment to any material term of such Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Recommendation Change and a new five-Business-Day period), (E) during such five-Business-Day period, the notifying party has considered and, at the reasonable request of the other party, engaged in good faith discussions with such party regarding, any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by the other party, and (F) the directors or trustees, as applicable, of the party proposing to take such action, following such five- 

   ##### 

  

    

Business-Day period, again reasonably determines in good faith (after

virtue of the Mergers and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof. Subject to, and in accordance with, the terms of, the applicable
ProLogis Share Plan and any applicable award agreement or other agreement
or other document evidencing ProLogis DEUs, each ProLogis DEU so assumed

ARTICLE I 

  

 _OFFICES_  

  

 Section 1\. The principal executive office of ProLogis Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Corporation"), shall be located at such place or places as the board of directors may designate. 

  

 Section 2\. The Corporation may also have offices at such other places as the board of directors may from time to time determine or the business of the Corporation may require. 

  

ARTICLE II 

   

 _MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_  

  

 Section 1\. All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such place as may be fixed from time to time by the board of directors and stated in the notice of the meeting. 

  

 Section 2\. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on such date and at such time as may be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the board of directors, at which the stockholders shall elect a board of directors, and transact such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting in accordance with these bylaws. To be properly brought before the annual meeting, business must be either (i) specified in the notice of annual meeting (or any supplement or amendment thereto) given by or at the direction of the board of directors, (ii) otherwise brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, or (iii) otherwise brought before the annual meeting by a stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote on the matter at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2 of Article II and who was a stockholder of record both at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 2 of Article II and at the time of the annual meeting. In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such business must be a proper matter for action by the stockholders and the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than thirty (30) days from the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the date of the annual meeting and not less than the later of ninety (90) days prior to the date of the annual meeting or, if less than one hundred (100) days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is given or made to stockholders, the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the annual 

   ##### 

  

 

meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. In no event shall any
postponement or adjournment of an annual meeting, or the announcement
thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice
as described above. A stockholders notice to the secretary shall set forth
(a) as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual
meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before
the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual
meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the stockholder proposing such
business, (iii) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock of
the Corporation which are beneficially owned by the stockholder, and (iv) any
material interest of the stockholder in such business and any material
interest of any Stockholder Associated Person (as defined below) in such
business, individually or in the aggregate, including any anticipated benefit
to the stockholder or the Stockholder Associated Person therefrom, and (b) as
to the stockholder giving the notice and any Stockholder Associated Person
(i) the name and record address (and current address, if different) of the
stockholder and the Stockholder Associated Person, (ii) the class, series and
number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are
beneficially owned or owned of record by the stockholder and by such
Stockholder Associated Person, if any, and the nominee holder for, and the
number of, shares owned beneficially but not of record by such stockholder
and by any such Stockholder Associated Person, (iii) whether and the extent to
which any hedging or other transaction or series of transactions has been
entered into by or on behalf of, or any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding (including any short position or any borrowing or lending of
shares of stock) has been made, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate
loss to or manage risk of stock price changes for, or to increase the voting
power of, such stockholder or any such Stockholder Associated Person with
respect to any share of stock of the Corporation, and a general description
of whether and the extent to which such stockholder or such Stockholder
Associated Person has engaged in such activities with respect to shares of
stock or other equity interests of any other company, and (iv) to the extent
known by the stockholder giving the notice, the name and address of any other
stockholder supporting the proposal of other business on the date of such
stockholders notice. For purposes of these bylaws, "Stockholder Associated
Person" shall mean, with respect to any stockholder, (x) any person
controlling, directly or indirectly, or acting in concert with, such
stockholder, (y) any beneficial owner of shares of stock of the Corporation
owned of record or beneficially by such stockholder, and (z) any person
controlling, controlled by or under common control with such Stockholder
Associated Person. Notwithstanding anything in these bylaws to the contrary,
no business shall be conducted at the annual meeting except in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 2 of Article II and no person
shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless
nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2(a) of
Article III. The officer of the Corporation presiding at an annual meeting
shall, if the facts warrant, determine that business was not properly brought
before the annual meeting in accordance with the provisions of this Section
2 of Article II, and if he should so determine, he shall so declare to the
annual meeting and any such business not properly brought before the meeting
shall not be transacted. 

   

 Section 3\. A majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, the holders of which are present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by law, by the Corporations charter or by these bylaws. A quorum, once established, shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a quorum and the votes present may continue to transact business until adjournment. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or 

   ##### 

  

 

represented at any meeting of the stockholders, a majority of the voting stock
represented in person or by proxy may adjourn the meeting from time to time
until a date not more than 120 days after the original record date, without
notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be
present or represented. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall
be present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have
been transacted at the meeting as originally notified. If the adjournment is
for more than 120 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote thereat. 

   

 Section 4\. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the holders of a majority of the stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy shall decide any question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which, by express provision of the Maryland General Corporation Law ("MGCL") or the rules of any securities exchange on which the Corporations capital stock is listed or the Corporations charter or these bylaws, a different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. 

  

 Section 5\. At each meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder having the right to vote may vote in person or may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy in any manner permitted by applicable law. All proxies must be filed with the secretary of the Corporation at the beginning of each meeting in order to be counted in any vote at the meeting. Subject to the provisions of the charter of the Corporation, each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of stock having voting power registered in his name on the books of the Corporation on the record date set by the board of directors as provided in Section 6 of Article V. 

  

 Section 6. 

  

 a. Subject to clause (d) below of this Section 6 of Article II, a favorable vote of a majority of the aggregate of (x) the votes cast "for" a director nominee and (y) the votes cast "against" a director nominee (or if directors are to be elected upon a favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast but in such circumstances stockholders generally are not offered the opportunity to cast a vote "against" a director nominee but instead are offered the opportunity to "withhold" votes, any votes designated to be "withheld" from voting in respect of a director nominee, which for these limited purposes will be deemed a vote cast and have the affect of a vote "against"), at a meeting of the stockholders duly called and held at which a quorum is present, shall be required to elect such director nominee. For purposes of determining whether a director nominee has received a favorable vote of a majority of the aggregate of the votes cast, a majority of the aggregate votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director (or, if the director is nevertheless to be elected upon a favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast but stockholders generally are not offered the opportunity to cast a vote "against" the director nominee but instead are offered the opportunity to "withhold" votes, then the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of votes "withheld" from voting in respect of such director nominee, which for these limited purposes will be deemed a vote cast). A vote will be considered withheld from a director nominee only if a stockholder is provided the opportunity to and does affirmatively withhold authority to vote for such director nominee in any proxy granted by such stockholder, in any event in accordance with instructions contained in the proxy statement or accompanying proxy 

   ##### 

  

 

card circulated for the meeting of stockholders at which the election of
directors is to be held or in a ballot to be submitted by such stockholder in
person at such meeting. A "broker non-vote" or abstention (or similar
expression) shall not in any event be deemed a vote cast for these
purposes. 

   

 b. If an otherwise incumbent director is not re-elected but would nevertheless for any reason otherwise remain in office, the director shall tender his or her resignation to the Board, subject to subsequent acceptance. The Nominating and Governance Committee will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Committees recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation will not participate in the Boards decision. 

  

 c. Directors properly elected shall hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors shall be duly elected and qualified. Directors need not be stockholders. If, for any cause, the Board of Directors shall not have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose in the manner provided in these bylaws. 

  

 d. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that the number of director nominees is expected to exceed the number of directors to be elected at a meeting (a "Contested Election"), with the determination that the number of director nominees is expected to exceed the number of directors to be elected, and, therefore, that an election of directors is a Contested Election, being made by the secretary of the Corporation as of the close of the applicable stockholder notice of nomination period set forth in Section 8 of Article II or Section 2(a) of Article III based on whether one or more stockholder notices of nomination were timely filed in accordance with Section 8 of Article II or Section 2(a) of Article III, as applicable (provided that the secretary shall also be able to consider such other facts and circumstances as may be reasonably relevant to the determination that an election of directors is a Contested Election, and provided further that any determination that an election of directors is a Contested Election shall be determinative only as to the timeliness of a stockholder notice of nomination and not otherwise as to its validity), then a plurality of all the votes cast at such meeting shall be sufficient to elect a director, and therefore, and for the avoidance of doubt, the director nominees shall not be elected at such meeting by a favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast. In such case where an election of directors is determined to be a Contested Election, stockholders shall be permitted to vote only "for" or to designate their votes to be "withheld" in respect of a director nominee, and shall not in such circumstance be permitted to vote "against" a nominee; and under such circumstances a vote designated to be "withheld", although present for purposes of establishing the presence of a quorum, will not be deemed a vote cast or a vote "against". If, prior to thirty days prior to the time the Corporation mails its initial proxy statement in connection with the election of directors at a meeting, one or more stockholder notices of nomination are withdrawn such that the number of nominees for election as director no longer exceeds the number of directors to be elected, then the election shall not be considered a Contested Election, but in all other cases, once an election is determined to be a Contested Election, a plurality of all the votes cast at such meeting shall be sufficient to elect a director. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 7\. Special meetings of the stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, unless otherwise proscribed by the charter, may be called at any time by the chief executive officer, a co-chief executive officer, the president, the chairman of the board, or by a majority of the directors, or by a committee of the board of directors which has been duly designated by the board of directors and whose powers and authority, as provided in a resolution of the board of directors or these bylaws, include the power to call such meetings. In addition, a special meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be called by the secretary of the Corporation on the written request of stockholders entitled to cast at least fifty percent (50%) of all votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, except that, in the case of a special meeting called to consider any matter which is substantially the same as a matter voted on at any special meeting for the stockholders held during the preceding twelve (12) months, the secretary of the Corporation shall not be required to call any such special meeting unless requested by stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting. 

  

 Section 8\. Business transacted at any special meeting of stockholders shall be limited to the purposes stated in the notice. Where the Corporations notice of meeting specifies that directors are to be elected at such special meeting, nominations of persons for election to the board of directors may be made only (i) pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the board of directors, (iii) by any committee of persons appointed by the board of directors with authority therefor or (iv) by a stockholder as provided in this Section 8 of Article II. In the event a special meeting of stockholders is called for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the board of directors, any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 8 of Article II and who was a stockholder of record both at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 8 of Article II and at the time of the special meeting, may nominate a person or persons, as the case may be, for election as a director as specified in the Corporations notice of meeting if the stockholders notice containing the information required by Section 2(a) of Article III shall have been delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not more than 120 days prior to the date of the special meeting and not less than the later of 90 days prior to the date of the special meeting or, if less than 100 days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting and of the nominees proposed by the board of directors to be elected at such meeting is given or made to stockholders, the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice was mailed or such public disclosure was made. In no event shall any postponement or adjournment of a special meeting, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. 

  

 Section 9\. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which notice shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called. The written notice of any meeting shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not less than 10 nor more than 90 days before the date of the meeting. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the Corporation. 

  

 Section 10\. Notwithstanding any other provision of the charter of the Corporation or these bylaws, Subtitle 7 of Title 3 of the MGCL (as the same may hereafter be amended from time to time) shall not apply to the voting rights of any shares of stock of the Corporation now or 

   ##### 

  

 

hereafter held by any existing or future stockholder of the Corporation
(regardless of the identity of such stockholder). 

   

ARTICLE III 

   

 _DIRECTORS_  

  

 Section 1\. The board of directors shall consist of a minimum of five (5) and a maximum of thirteen (13) directors. The number of directors shall be fixed or changed from time to time, within the minimum and maximum, by the then elected directors, provided that at least a majority of the directors shall be Independent Directors, as defined from time to time by the Listing Standards of the New York Stock Exchange and any other relevant laws, rules and regulations. Any determination by the board of directors as to the qualification of any director as an "Independent Director" shall be conclusive for all purposes. Until increased or decreased by the directors pursuant to these bylaws, the exact number of directors shall be eleven (11). The directors need not be stockholders. Except as provided in Section 2 of this Article III and in Article VIII with respect to vacancies, the directors shall be elected as provided in the charter at each annual meeting of the stockholders, and each director elected shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his death, retirement, resignation or removal. 

  

 Section 2\. (a) Nominations of persons for election to the board of directors of the Corporation at the annual meeting of stockholders may be made only (i) pursuant to the Corporations notice of meeting; (ii) by or at the direction of the board of directors or (iii) by any committee of persons appointed by the board of directors with authority therefor or by any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2(a) of Article III and who was a stockholder of record both at the time of giving of notice provided for in this Section 2(a) of Article III and at the time of the annual meeting. Such nominations by any stockholder shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholders notice shall be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the preceding years annual meeting, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not more than 120 days prior to the date of the annual meeting and not less than the later of 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting or, if less than 100 days notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to stockholders, the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. In no event shall any postponement or adjournment of an annual meeting, or the announcement thereof, commence a new time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. Such stockholders notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, (a) the name, age, business address and residence address of the person, (b) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (c) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are beneficially owned or owned of record by the person, the date such shares were acquired and the investment intent of such acquisition, (d) any other information relating to the person that is required to be disclosed in 

   ##### 

  

 

solicitations for proxies for election of directors pursuant to the Rules and
Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 14 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (e) such persons written
consent to serve as a director if elected, and (f) a statement whether such
person, if elected or re-elected, or as a condition thereto, will tender
an irrevocable resignation effective upon such persons failure to receive
the required vote for re-election at the next meeting at which such person
would face re-election and upon acceptance of such resignation by the Board,
in accordance with the Corporations Corporate Governance Principles (and
assuming that such person would otherwise remain in office as a director
notwithstanding such failure); and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the
notice and any Stockholder Associated Person (a) the name and record address
(and current address, if different) of the stockholder and the Stockholder
Associated Person, (b) the class, series and number of shares of capital stock
of the Corporation which are beneficially owned or owned of record by the
stockholder and by such Stockholder Associated Person, if any, and the
nominee holder for, and the number of, shares owned beneficially but not of
record by such stockholder and by any such Stockholder Associated Person, (c)
whether and the extent to which any hedging or other transaction or series of
transactions has been entered into by or on behalf of, or any other
agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any short position or any
borrowing or lending of shares of stock) has been made, the effect or intent
of which is to mitigate loss to or manage risk of stock price changes for, or
to increase the voting power of, such stockholder or any such Stockholder
Associated Person with respect to any share of stock of the Corporation, and
a general description of whether and the extent to which such stockholder or
such Stockholder Associated Person has engaged in such activities with
respect to shares of stock or other equity interests of any other company, and
(d) to the extent known by the stockholder giving the notice, the name and
address of any other stockholder supporting the nominee for election or re-
election as a director on the date of such stockholders notice. The
Corporation may require any proposed nominee to furnish such
other information as may reasonably be required by the Corporation to
determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of
the Corporation or that could be material to a reasonable stockholders
understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such nominee. Except
as may otherwise be provided in these bylaws or any other agreement relating
to the right to designate nominees for election to the board of directors, no
person shall be eligible for election as a director of the Corporation unless
nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2(a) of
Article III. The officer of the Corporation presiding at an annual
meeting shall, if the facts warrant, determine that a nomination was not made
in accordance with the foregoing procedure, and if he should so determine, he
shall so declare to the meeting and the defective nomination shall be
disregarded. 

   

 (b) Except as may otherwise be provided pursuant to Article IV of the Corporations charter with respect to any rights of holders of preferred stock to elect additional directors and any other requirement in these bylaws or other agreement relating to the right to designate nominees for election to the board of directors, should a vacancy in the board of directors occur or be created (whether arising through death, retirement or resignation), such vacancy shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even though less than a quorum of the board of directors or, in the case of a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors, by a majority of the entire board of directors. In the case of a vacancy created by the removal of a director, the vacancy shall be filled by the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to elect the director who was removed at the next annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of stockholders called for such purpose, provided, however, 

   ##### 

  

 

that such vacancy may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
remaining directors, subject to approval by the stockholders entitled to
elect the director who was removed at the next annual meeting of stockholders
or at a special meeting of stockholders called for such purpose. A director
so elected to fill a vacancy shall serve for the remainder of the term. 

   

 Section 3\. The property and business of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its board of directors. In addition to the powers and authorities by these bylaws expressly conferred upon it, the board may exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and things as are not by statute or by the Corporations charter or by these bylaws directed or required to be exercised or done by the stockholders. 

  

 Section 4\. Subject to Article VIII, the board of directors shall elect a chairman of the board of directors who shall hold that position until a successor is elected and qualified. The chairman of the board of directors shall preside at meetings of the stockholders and shall set the agenda for meetings of the board of directors. 

  

 Section 5\. Regardless of whether the chairman of the board of directors is an Independent Director, the Independent Directors of the board of directors may elect an Independent Director to be the Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director may conduct separate meetings of the Independent Directors and perform other duties appropriate to his or her responsibilities, including: (a) preparing, in consultation with the chairman of the board of directors, committee chairs, and other directors, the agendas for meetings of the board of directors; (b) coordinating the activities of the other Independent Directors; (c) approving, in consultation with other Independent Directors, the retention and compensation of consultants who report directly to the board of directors; (d) reviewing with the chief executive officer (or each co-chief executive officer) such chief executive officers performance evaluation conducted by the Independent Directors; (e) presiding at non-management meetings of the Independent Directors and conveying to management directors the results of deliberations among non-management directors; and (f) acting as representative of the non-management for communication with interested parties. 

  

 _MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS_  

   

 Section 4\. The directors may hold their meetings and have one or more offices, and keep the books of the Corporation, outside the State of Maryland. 

  

 Section 5\. Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held at such time and place as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the board, and no additional notice shall be required. 

  

 Section 6\. Special meetings of the board of directors may be called by the chief executive officer, a co-chief executive officer, the president or the chairman of the board of directors on forty-eight hours notice to each director, either personally or by mail or by telegram; special meetings shall be called by the chief executive officer, a co-chief executive officer, the president or the secretary in like manner and on like notice on the written request of two directors unless the board consists of only one director, in which case special meetings shall be called by the chief executive officer, a co-chief executive officer, the president or the secretary in like manner 

   ##### 

  

 

and on like notice on the written request of the sole director. 

   

 Section 7\.
