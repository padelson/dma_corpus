number of directors to be elected, and, therefore, that an election of directors is a Contested
Election, being made by the secretary of the Corporation as of the close of the applicable
stockholder notice of nomination period set forth in Section&nbsp;8 of Article&nbsp;II or Section 2(a) of
Article&nbsp;III based on whether one or more stockholder notices of nomination were timely filed in

that the secretary shall also be able to consider such other facts and circumstances as may be
reasonably relevant to the determination that an election of directors is a Contested Election, and
provided further that any determination that an election of directors is a Contested Election shall
be determinative only as to the timeliness of a stockholder notice of nomination and not otherwise
as to its validity), then a plurality of all the votes cast at such meeting shall be sufficient to
elect a director, and therefore, and for the avoidance of doubt, the director nominees shall not be
elected at such meeting by a favorable vote of a majority of the votes cast. In such case where an
election of directors is determined to be a Contested Election, stockholders shall be permitted to
vote only &#147;for&#148; or to designate their votes to be &#147;withheld&#148; in respect of a director nominee, and
shall not in such circumstance be permitted to vote &#147;against&#148; a nominee; and under such
circumstances a vote designated to be &#147;withheld&#148;, although present for purposes of establishing the
presence of a quorum, will not be deemed a vote cast or a vote &#147;against&#148;. If, prior to thirty days
prior to the time the Corporation mails its initial proxy statement in connection with the election
of directors at a meeting, one or more stockholder notices of nomination are withdrawn such that
the number of nominees for election as director no longer exceeds the number of directors to be
elected, then the election shall not be considered a Contested Election, but in all other cases,
once an election is determined to be a Contested Election, a plurality of all the votes cast at
such meeting shall be sufficient to elect a director.
