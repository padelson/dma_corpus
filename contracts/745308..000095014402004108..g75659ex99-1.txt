components thereof in reasonable detail) (the "CLOSING DATE INDEBTEDNESS"), as
of the Closing Date. If the Purchaser does not deliver the Closing Date Balance
Sheet prior to the expiration of ninety (90) days after the Closing Date and
the Seller does not, within ninety (90) days following the Closing Date,
provide the Purchaser with written notice that it believes in good faith the
Estimated Working Capital or the Estimated Indebtedness did not reflect the


                                      16
<PAGE>

consolidated Working Capital of the Companies or the Indebtedness,
respectively, of the Companies as of the Closing Date, then the Estimated
Working Capital and the Estimated Indebtedness shall constitute the Closing
Date Working Capital and/or the Closing Date Indebtedness, as applicable, and
shall be final and binding on the parties. The Closing Date Balance Sheet, the
Closing Date Working Capital and the Closing Date Indebtedness shall be
prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a closed (settled) basis.

                           (ii)     Until the Closing Date Working Capital and
Closing Date Indebtedness have become final in accordance with this Section
2.5(a), the Purchaser shall provide the Seller and its authorized
representatives with reasonable access to the books and records and senior
financial staff of the Company (and otherwise generally will cooperate with the
Seller and its authorized representatives), to the extent relevant to the
determination of the Closing Date Working Capital and the Closing Date
Indebtedness, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice.

                           (iii)    If the Seller in good faith disagrees with
the Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital or the Closing
Date Indebtedness as set forth on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, the Seller
may within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt thereof deliver a written
notice to the Purchaser disagreeing with such calculation. Any such notice of
disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail those items or amounts
comprising the Closing Date Working Capital or the Closing Date Indebtedness as
to which the Seller disagrees and the basis of such disagreement, and the
Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and amounts
contained in the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Indebtedness.
If no such notice of disagreement is timely delivered, the Closing Date Working
Capital and the Closing Date Indebtedness shall be final and binding on the
parties.

                           (iv)     If a notice of disagreement shall be timely
delivered pursuant to Section 2.5(a)(ii) of this Agreement or if the Purchaser
does not timely deliver the Closing Date Balance Sheet and pursuant to Section
2.5(a)(i) the Seller timely delivers written notice that it believes the
Estimated Working Capital or the Estimated Indebtedness should be changed, the
Seller and the Purchaser shall, during the fifteen (15) Business Days following
such delivery, use their reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts. If such an agreement is reached, the Closing Date Working
Capital or Closing Date Indebtedness as so agreed shall be final and binding on
the parties. If the parties are unable to reach such agreement, the New York
City office of a nationally recognized independent accounting firm not then
acting as the principal outside accountant for the Companies, the Seller or the
Purchaser and as mutually agreed by the Purchaser and the Seller (the
"ACCOUNTING REFEREE"), shall be retained to review promptly this Agreement and
the disputed


                                      17
<PAGE>

items or amounts. If the parties are unable to agree mutually upon an
Accounting Referee then each party shall select a nationally recognized
accounting firm. Such two (2) nationally recognized accounting firms shall then
in turn mutually select a separate nationally recognized accounting firm not
then acting as the principal outside accountant for the Companies, the Seller
or the Purchaser who shall then be designated as the "Accounting Referee." In
connection therewith, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Date Working Capital or the Closing Date Indebtedness as
to which the Seller has disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to the
Seller and the Purchaser, as promptly as practicable, and within forty-five
(45) days of being referred the matter, a report setting forth its adjustments,
if any, to the Closing Date Balance Sheet or the Closing Date Indebtedness
(including any adjustments to non-disputed items necessary as a result of
changes to disputed items) and the calculations supporting such adjustments.
Such report shall be final and binding upon the parties and the Closing Date
Working Capital or the Closing Date Indebtedness, as adjusted pursuant to such
report, shall be final and binding on the parties. The cost of the Accounting
Referee's review and report shall be borne equally by the parties.

                           (v)      If the Estimated Working Capital exceeds
the Closing Date Working Capital reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
then the Seller shall pay or cause to be paid to the Purchaser, as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price, with interest as provided in Section 2.5(b),
an amount equal to the amount of such excess. If the Closing Date Working
Capital reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet exceeds the Estimated
Working Capital, then the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price, with interest as provided in Section 2.6(b), an amount
equal to the amount of such excess.

                           (vi)     If the Estimated Indebtedness exceeds the
Closing Date Indebtedness reflected on the Closing Date Balance Sheet, then the
Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, with
interest as provided in Section 2.5(b), an amount equal to the amount of such
excess. If the Closing Date Indebtedness reflected on the Closing Date Balance
Sheet exceeds the Estimated Indebtedness, then the Seller shall pay to the
Purchaser, as an adjustment to the Purchaser Price, with interest as provided
in Section 2.5(b), an amount equal to the amount of such excess.

                           (vii)    For the avoidance of doubt, no amount shall
be included in both "CURRENT LIABILITIES" for purposes of calculating Estimated
Working Capital or Closing Date Working Capital and in "INDEBTEDNESS" for
purposes of calculating Estimated Indebtedness or Closing Date Indebtedness.

                  (b)      Payments and Interest. Any payments pursuant to this
Section 2.5 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
accounts at United


                                      18
<PAGE>

States banks designated in writing by the Purchaser or the Seller, as the case
may be. Any amount due pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall bear interest for the
period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the payment date at
the rate of three percent (3%) per annum.

consolidated income statement and balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for the two (2) month periods ended February 28, 2002 and 2001

basis in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the periods

cash flows for the periods then ended, in the case of the Unaudited Financial
Statements subject to normal year-end adjustments that are not material in the

of any nature (absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise) due or to become
due, except for such liabilities and obligations as were incurred since the
date of the Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice which individually and in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (d)      The calculation of Estimated Working Capital and the
calculation of Indebtedness, in each case as of the Closing Date, delivered by
the Seller to the Purchaser were prepared in good faith in accordance with GAAP
by the Seller based on the books and records of the Companies.

with past practice and


                                      22

         SECTION 3.7       ASSETS.

                  (a)      Each of the Companies owns, or otherwise has a valid
leasehold interest providing sufficient and legally enforceable (subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar Laws relating to creditor's rights and to general principles of
equity) rights to use, all of the property and assets necessary or material to
its conduct of the Business as currently conducted or otherwise used or held for
use by it in the Business. Except as indicated on Schedule 3.7(a), none of the
material assets used by any of the Companies in the conduct of the Business are
owned or leased by the Seller or any Affiliate thereof other than one of the
Companies. The Companies have good title to all assets reflected on the Balance
Sheet or acquired since the date of the Balance Sheet, free and clear of all
Liens except Permitted Liens, other than assets disposed of since the date of
the Balance Sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice which are not in the aggregate material. Such assets are, considered in
the aggregate, in reasonable operating condition and repair (ordinary wear and
tear excepted) in all material respects, have been reasonably maintained in all
material respects and are suitable for their present use in all material
respects.

                  (b)      The Companies do not own any real property and none

Seller on behalf of the Companies (including any real property owned by the
Seller or its Affiliates and leased to the Companies), indicating the use
thereof, the lessee of such real property, and the name and address of the
lessor together with any amendments, modifications, extensions or other
agreements (the "LEASES"). With respect to all real property leased by any of
the Companies (the "REAL PROPERTY"), the Companies have possession thereof, and
have valid leasehold interests providing exclusive and legally enforceable
rights to use such Real Property, free and clear of all Liens except Permitted
Liens. The current use of the Real Property by the Companies does not violate in
any material respect the certificate of occupancy thereof, any local zoning or
similar land use or other Laws or the applicable Lease. None of the Companies
nor any of their Affiliates have received written notice of any pending or
threatened condemnation proceeding, or of any sale or other disposition in lieu
of condemnation, affecting any of the Real Property. None of the Companies has
subleased any of the Real Property or given any third party any license or other
right to occupy any portion of the Real Property leased by it (other than the
access provided to sales associates to work in the offices). Except as set forth
in Schedule 3.7(b), no Real Property is used for any purpose other than the
conduct of the Business.

<PAGE>

                  (c)      The Seller has delivered or made available to the
Purchaser a true, correct and complete copy of each of the Leases, and (i) each
Lease is legal, valid, binding and enforceable against the Companies party

fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws relating
to creditor's rights and to general principles of equity; (ii) neither the
Companies, nor, to the knowledge of the Seller, any other party to any Lease,
has waived any material term or condition thereof, and all material covenants to
be performed by the Companies prior to the Closing, or to the Seller's
knowledge, any other party to any Lease, have been performed in all material
respects; (iii) neither the Companies nor, to the knowledge of the Seller, any
other party to any Lease, is in breach or default under any Lease, and no event
or circumstance exists or has occurred which, with the delivery of notice, the
passage of time or both, would constitute a breach or default by any Company or
to the Seller's knowledge, any other party thereto, or to the Seller's knowledge
permit the termination, modification or acceleration of rent under any Lease;
(iv) no security deposit or portion thereof deposited with respect to any Lease
has been applied in respect of a breach or default under any Lease which has not
been redeposited in full; (v) the Companies do not owe, nor will they at
Closing, pursuant to existing agreements, owe, any brokerage commissions or
finder's fees with respect to any Lease; and (vi) the Companies have not
collaterally assigned or granted any security interest in any Lease or any
interest therein.

                  (d)      Schedule 3.7(d) sets forth for each of the Companies
that has such property, the aggregate net book value of the furniture, fixtures
and equipment owned and used by the Companies at such offices. Except as set

is held under any lease, security agreement, conditional sales contract, or
other title retention or security arrangement or subject to any Liens.

                  (e)      All receivables of the Companies reflected on the
Balance Sheet, and all receivables created after the date of the Balance Sheet,
arose from valid transactions with unrelated parties in the ordinary course of
business and to the knowledge of the Seller, subject to reserves for doubtful
accounts reflected on the Balance Sheet, are collectible in their full amount,
net of applicable reserves reflected on the Balance Sheet. Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.7(e), no account receivable is owned by any Person other than the

Intellectual Property owned by the Companies or used by one or more of the
Companies and owned by an Affiliate of the Companies. Schedule 3.12(d)(ii) sets
forth a complete and accurate list of all agreements permitting the Companies to
use any Intellectual Property (such agreements, together with the agreements
referenced in Schedule 3.12(d)(ii) are collectively referred to herein as the
"LICENSES"). The Licenses are valid and binding obligations of the Companies,
enforceable against the Companies, and to the Seller's knowledge, against the

Intellectual Property owned or material Intellectual Property used by any of the
Companies; and no such claims have been made against a third party by any of the
Companies. There are no claims or suits pending or to the knowledge of Seller
threatened, and neither the Seller nor any of the Companies has received any
written notice of a third-party claim or suit (a) alleging that the Companies'
activities or the conduct of the Business infringes upon or constitutes the
unauthorized use of the proprietary rights of any third party, or (b)
challenging the ownership, use, validity or enforceability of any Intellectual
Property. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.12(e), there are no settlements,
consents, judgments, orders, consent agreements or other agreements (other than
the Licenses) which restrict the Companies' rights to use any Intellectual
Property.

                  (f)      The consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not result in the loss or impairment of any of the Companies' or the
Purchaser's rights to own or use any of the Intellectual Property nor will it
require the consent of any Governmental Authority or third party in respect of
any such Intellectual Property, except as set forth on Schedule 3.12(f).

                  (g)      The inclusion of the phrase "[s]ubject to the uses
permitted under the Retained Use Agreements" in Section 2 of the Transitional

Affiliates to use the ARVIDA Mark or the St. Joe Mark in any way but only
modifies the exclusivity of such grant with respect to Persons other than the
Seller or its Affiliates.

                  (h)      The Seller represents and warrants that (A) Schedule

right or other stock-based incentive plan, program, agreement, or arrangement
applicable to employees, consultants, independent contractors or sales
associates of each of the Companies; (ii) each severance, change-in-control, or
termination pay, surgical, hospitalization or other medical, disability, life or
other insurance, supplemental unemployment benefits and other "welfare" plan,
fund or program (within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA) applicable to
employees, consultants, independent contractors or sales associates of each of
the Companies; (iii) each profit-sharing, stock bonus or pension plan (except

<PAGE>
employees, consultants, independent contractors or sales associates of each of
the Companies; and (iv) each other employee benefit plan, fund, program,
agreement or arrangement, that are or have been sponsored, maintained or
contributed to or required to be contributed to by any of the Companies or to
which any of the Companies has any liability or potential liability for the
benefit of any current or former employee or director of the Companies
(collectively, the "PLANS"). Schedule 3.14(a) identifies each of the Plans that
is an "employee welfare benefit plan," or "employee pension benefit plan" as
such terms are defined in Sections 3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA (such plans being
hereinafter referred to collectively as the "ERISA PLANS"). The Seller also
sponsors the St. Joe Company 1998 Stock Incentive Plan and a defined benefit
plan known as The St. Joe Company Pension Plan ("SELLER PLANS") which covers
employees of the Companies. None of the Companies nor any trade or business,
whether or not incorporated (including Seller and its Affiliates)(an "ERISA
AFFILIATE"), that together with any of the Companies would be deemed a "single
employer" within the meaning of Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA has any formal plan
or commitment, whether legally binding or not, to create any additional Plan or
modify or change any existing Plan or the Seller Plans in any material respect
(except as required by law) that would affect any current or former employee of
any of the Companies. No Plan is or has been subject to Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code and none of the Companies has sponsored, maintained,
contributed to or been required to contribute to any such plan within the past
six (6) years of the date hereof. No Plan is a "multiemployer plan," as such
term is defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.

                  (b)      With respect to each of the Plans, each of the
Companies has previously made available to the Purchaser true and complete
copies of each of the following documents, as applicable: (i) a copy of the Plan
documents (including all amendments thereto) for each written Plan or a written
description of any Plan that is not otherwise in writing; (ii) a copy of the
three (3) most recent annual reports and actuarial reports, if required under
ERISA, and the most recent report prepared with respect thereto in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87; (iii) a copy of the
most recent summary plan description and all other subsequent summaries of
material modifications; (iv) if the Plan is funded through a trust or any other
funding vehicle, a copy of the trust or other funding agreement (including all
amendments thereto) and the latest financial statements thereof, if any; and (v)
the most recent determination letter received from the IRS with respect to each
Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.

                  (c)      No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA
has been incurred by any of the Companies or any ERISA Affiliate that has not
been satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to
any of the Companies of incurring any such liability. The Companies do not have
any liability (i) under Title


                                       37
<PAGE>

IV of ERISA, (ii) under Section 302 of ERISA, (iii) under Sections 412 and 4971
of the Code, or (iv) as a result of failure to comply with the continuation
coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the
Code.

                  (d)      All contributions required to be made with respect to
any Plan on or prior to the date of the Agreement have been timely made or are
reflected on the Balance Sheet.

                  (e)      None of the Companies, nor any of the ERISA Plans,
nor any trust created thereunder, nor to the knowledge of Seller, any trustee or
plan administrator thereof, has engaged in a transaction with respect to any of
the ERISA Plans, that assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as
of the date hereof, could subject the Companies or the Plans to any material
liability for either a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of
ERISA or a tax imposed pursuant to Section 4975(a) or (b) of the Code. All
contributions and premiums which any of the Companies is required to pay under
the terms of each of the ERISA Plans and the Code, have, to the extent required,
been paid or properly recorded on the financial statements or records of any of
the Companies in all material respects.

                  (f)      Each of the Plans has been operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and any Organizational
Documents and Law, including ERISA and the Code; (ii) each of the ERISA Plans
that is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service, and no circumstance exists that is or could result in a revocation of
any such favorable determination letter or loss of the qualification of such
ERISA Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code; (iii) no fund established under an
ERISA Plan is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code; and (iv) there are no pending, or to the knowledge of the Seller,
threatened or anticipated claims by or on behalf of any Plan, by any employee or
beneficiary under any such Plan, or otherwise involving any such Plan (other
than routine claims for benefits or relating to qualified domestic relations
orders). No amounts payable under any of the Plans or any other contract,
agreement or arrangement with respect to which any of the Companies may have any
liability would fail to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by virtue
of Section 280G of the Code.

                  (g)      No Plan provides benefits, including death,
hospitalization, surgical, medical or similar benefits (whether or not insured),
with respect to current or former employees of any of the Companies or any ERISA
Affiliate after retirement or other termination of service (other than coverage
mandated by applicable Laws or death benefits under any "employee pension
plan"). None of the Companies has any liability, contingent or otherwise, under
any excess benefit plan or supplemental executive retirement plan. No condition
exists that would prevent


                                       38
<PAGE>
any of the Companies from amending or terminating any Plan providing health or
medical benefits in respect of any active or former employee of any of the
Companies.

                  (h)      Except as otherwise set forth on Schedule 3.14(h),
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not,
either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or
former employee, officer or director of any of the Companies to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other similar payment or (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of or otherwise enhance any
benefit due any such employee, officer or director.

                  (i)      Schedule 3.14(i) is a true, correct and complete
schedule of the aggregate amounts of all accrued liabilities of the Companies
that are owed on or following the date of this Agreement to any sales
associates, managers or employees of the Business or to any other Person
pursuant to any existing bonus plan, deferred compensation plan or vacation
plan.

                  (j)      On or after the Closing, upon no more than sixty(60)
days notice, each and all of the Plans may be terminated in accordance with its
terms without material cost to the Purchaser.

respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates performed at any time prior to the
Closing Date to the extent credited by any of the Companies, the Seller, or
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates under the applicable Plan or Seller

                  (f) The Purchaser shall honor, without modification, all
Plans sponsored or maintained by the Companies which are disclosed in Schedule
3.14; provided, however, that this undertaking is not intended to prevent any

their terms, including any reserved right to amend, modify, suspend, revoke or
terminate any such Plan.

                  (g) The Purchaser shall, or shall cause any of the Companies

<PAGE>

Damages (as defined in Section 7.2(a)) suffered by any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties resulting from, arising out of, relating to or incurred
with respect to (i) the Lease Guaranties or (ii) the Seller's guarantee of the
obligations of Arvida Mortgage under the Warehouse Credit Agreement.

         SECTION 5.8       PROSECUTION OF CERTAIN CLAIMS.

                  (a) Each of the Seller and the Purchaser agrees to promptly
notify the other in writing if it becomes aware that any Person other than (x)
the Seller and its Affiliates, (y) the Purchaser and its Affiliates or (z)
other Persons to the extent permitted pursuant to Section 2(a)(A) of the Use of
Name Agreement is using the ARVIDA Mark in the Business. The Seller agrees, and
to the extent within its reasonable control agrees to cause any of its
Affiliates relevant thereto, in each case at the Seller's sole cost and
expense, to use its best efforts to restrain and prevent any Person (other than
the Seller and its Affiliates or the Purchaser and its Affiliates or other
Persons to the extent permitted by Section 2(a)(A) of the Use of Name
Agreement) from using or purporting to have the right to license or sublicense
the use of the ARVIDA Mark in the Business and to seek to obtain all monetary
damages available in respect of such use, licensing or sublicensing, including
by promptly commencing and diligently prosecuting at the Seller's sole cost and
expense a claim for injunctive relief and, if available, monetary damages
against such Person. In connection with any such prosecution, the Seller and
its Affiliates shall keep the Purchaser apprised of all material developments
as they occur and will provide the Purchaser with the opportunity to consult
regularly with the Seller on the appropriate actions and strategies by which to
carry out such prosecution.

                  (b) In the event the Seller does not, within five (5)
Business Days after giving or receiving the notice described above, commence
judicial action in respect of any such use of the ARVIDA Mark in the Business
in one or more appropriate courts of competent jurisdiction seeking any and all
available equitable and other relief (such relief to include, as appropriate,
one or more of a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a
permanent injunction), Purchaser shall have the right, on behalf and at the
cost of the Seller (to the extent permitted under applicable law and
regulation), but only after providing the Seller at least two (2) Business
Days' prior written notice (which notice shall include a summary of the actions
proposed to be brought and the forum or forums in which such actions will be
brought), to commence such a judicial action in the name and on behalf of the
Seller; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall not have the right to
commence any judicial action on behalf of the Seller if and to the extent the
Seller, acting in good faith, and based on the advice of outside counsel, has
determined and advised the Purchaser that commencement or prosecution of such
action by or on behalf of the Seller or any of its Affiliates would violate or
constitute a breach of a fiduciary


                                      49
<PAGE>

duty that the Seller or any of its Affiliates owes to any of their respective
Affiliates or to any Partner, member, other equity holder or Affiliate of any
such Affiliate.

                  (c) In the event that the Purchaser commences any such action
as permitted in the preceding paragraph, the Seller shall have the right at any
time thereafter, by written notice to the Purchaser (which notice shall include
an affirmative undertaking to continue the prosecution of such action in
accordance with the requirements of Section 5.8(a), and which right shall be
subject to the Seller prosecuting such action in accordance with such
requirements), to assume and direct in all respects the prosecution of such
action in accordance with the requirements above, and the Purchaser agrees to
take such actions as the Seller may reasonably request to turn control of the
action over to the Seller.

                  (d) The obligations of the parties under this Section 5.8
shall terminate on December 21, 2008.

practice, except as required by applicable Law), on a timely basis (including
extensions) all Tax Returns of the Companies for all Pre-Closing Periods (as

Affiliate) shall be permitted to review any such Tax Returns before they are
filed; and provided, further, in the case of any Tax Return of the Seller or
any of the Seller's Affiliates other than the Companies, the Purchaser's right
to review shall be limited to information relating solely to the Companies. The
Seller shall pay all Taxes shown to be due and payable on such Tax Returns.

                  (b) The Purchaser (or its Affiliate) shall prepare and file
or cause to be prepared and filed on a timely basis (including extensions) all

         SECTION 6.2 SECTION 338(H)(10) ELECTION.

                  (a) The Purchaser (and its Affiliates) and the Seller (and
its Affiliates) shall jointly make a timely and effective election provided for
by Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury
Regulations and any comparable election under state, local or foreign Tax Law
with respect to the purchase of the capital stock of each of the Companies
(each, an "ELECTION" and collectively, the "ELECTIONS"). The Purchaser, the
Seller and their respective Affiliates shall cooperate with each other to take
all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such additional forms,
returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required to effect
and preserve timely Elections in accordance with the provisions of Section
338(h)(10) of the Code and Section 1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations
(and any comparable provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law) or any
successor provisions. Specifically, the Seller and the Purchaser shall, within
sixty (60) days of the later of the date on which the Closing Date Working
Capital has been finalized pursuant to Section 2.5 or the date that the
allocation of the "aggregate deemed sales price" is finalized under Section
6.2(b), exchange completed and executed copies of the Internal Revenue Service
Form 8023, required schedules thereto, and any similar state, local or foreign
forms. If changes are required in any of these forms as a result of information
which is first available after the date on which any such form is completed and
executed pursuant to the preceding sentence, the parties will promptly agree on
such changes. The Seller, the Purchaser and their respective Affiliates shall
(i) report the purchase by the Mortgage Purchaser of the Mortgage Shares and
the acquisition of the capital stock of Arvida Mortgage consistent with such
Election and (ii) report the purchase by the Purchaser of the Shares and the
acquisition of the capital stock of each of the Companies (other than Arvida
Mortgage) consistent with each such Election and in each case, shall take no
position inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any
taxing authority or otherwise.

                  (b) In connection with the Elections, as soon as practicable
after the Closing, the Seller and the Purchaser (or its Affiliate) shall agree
as to the manner in which the "aggregate deemed sales price," as defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.338-4, with respect to each of the Companies
shall be allocated among the assets of each of the Companies, which allocations
shall (i) be made in accordance with Section 338(b) of the Code and any
applicable Treasury Regulations, (ii) reflect, and be made in accordance with,
the purchase price for the Mortgage Shares as stated in Section 2.1 of this
Agreement and (iii) reflect and be made in accordance with, the Purchase Price
for the Shares pursuant to Section 2.2 of this Agreement. If, within sixty (60)
days prior to the last date for filing an Election, the parties have not
reached an agreement pursuant to the preceding sentence, the dispute shall be
presented to an independent accounting firm mutually agreed upon by the Seller
and


                                      51
<PAGE>

the Purchaser, whose determination shall be binding on both parties. The fees
and expenses of such accounting firm shall be paid equally by the Seller and
the Purchaser (or its Affiliate). The Seller, the Purchaser and their
respective affiliates shall (i) be bound by any such allocation for purposes of
determining any Taxes, (ii) prepare and file their Tax Returns on a basis
consistent with such determination of the aggregate deemed sales price and such
allocations and (iii) take no position inconsistent with such determination and
allocations on any applicable Tax Return, in any proceeding before any taxing
authority or otherwise. In the event that any of the allocations are disputed
by any taxing authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall
promptly notify the other party concerning resolution of the dispute.

         SECTION 6.3 TAX INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) The Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties (as defined in Section 7.2(a) below) from and
against any and all Damages asserted against, resulting to, imposed on,
sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted against any of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from
(without duplication of any amounts paid pursuant to Section 7.2): (i) all
Taxes, including Taxes with respect to all Elections, imposed upon any of the
Companies with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof ending on or
before the Closing Date ("PRE-CLOSING PERIODS"), and for any taxable period
beginning on or before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date
("STRADDLE PERIODS"), but only with respect to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on the close of the Closing Date and in the manner provided in
Section 6.3(c) of this Agreement, (ii) all Taxes imposed on any of the
Companies under section 1.1502-6 of the Treasury Regulations (and corresponding
provisions of state, local, or foreign Law) as a result of being a member of
any federal, state, local or foreign consolidated, unitary, combined or similar
group for any taxable period ending on or before, or that includes, the Closing
Date, and (iii) any Taxes of or relating to the Foundation.

                  (b) The Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Seller Indemnified Parties (as defined under Section 7.3(a) below) from and
against any and all Damages, asserted against, resulting to, imposed on,
sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted against any of the Seller
Indemnified Parties, directly or indirectly, by reason of or resulting from any
and all Taxes imposed upon any of the Companies with respect to (a) any taxable
period beginning after the Closing Date ("POST-CLOSING PERIODS") or (b) the
portion of any Straddle Period beginning the day after the Closing Date and in
the manner provided for in Section 6.3(c) hereof (the "POST-CLOSING STRADDLE
PERIOD").

                  (c) For purposes of this Section 6.3, in order to apportion
appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the parties hereto
shall, to the


                                      52
<PAGE>

extent permitted under applicable Law, elect with the relevant Tax authority to
treat for all Tax purposes the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year
or period of the Companies. In any case where applicable Law does not permit
the Companies to treat the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year or
period, the portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be:

                           (i) in the case of Taxes that are imposed on a
periodic basis (such as real property taxes), deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an
arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period)
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days
in the Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant
Straddle Period; and

                           (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in (i) (such
as taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts, or
(y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of
property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) and (z) payroll and similar
Taxes), deemed equal to the amount that would be payable if the taxable year or
period ended on the Closing Date; provided, that, in determining such amount,
exemptions, allowances, or deductions that are calculated on a periodic basis,
such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be taken into account on a
pro-rated basis in the manner described in Section 6.3(c)(i).

                  (d) All amounts payable or to be paid under this Section 6.3
(the "TAX INDEMNITY PAYMENTS") shall be paid in immediately available funds
within five (5) Business Days after the later of (i) receipt of a written
request from the party entitled to such Tax Indemnity Payment and (ii) the day
of payment of the amount that is the subject of the Tax Indemnity Payment by
the party entitled to receive the Tax Indemnity Payment.

                  (e) For purposes of Article 6, any transaction that takes
place after the Closing, including transactions taking place after the Closing
but on the Closing Date, shall be considered to be made after the Closing Date.

         SECTION 6.4       TAX REFUNDS. The Purchaser shall pay to the Seller(a)
all refunds or credits of Taxes received by the Purchaser or any of the
Companies after the Closing Date and attributable to Taxes paid by any of the
Companies with respect to a Pre-Closing Period and (b) a portion of all refunds
or credits of Taxes received by the Purchaser or any of the Companies after the
Closing Date and attributable to Taxes paid by any of the Companies with
respect to any Straddle Period (such portion to be allocated consistent with
the principles set forth in Section


                                      53
<PAGE>

6.3(c)), in each case, net of any Taxes imposed on such refund amount. The
Purchaser hereby agrees to the extent permitted by Law, to waive the carry back
of any tax attribute with respect to any of the Companies.

         SECTION 6.5       TAX INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES.

                  (a) If a notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment,
adjustment, assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court
proceeding, suit, dispute or other claim (a "TAX CLAIM") shall be delivered or
sent to or commenced or initiated against any of the Companies by any taxing
authority with respect to Taxes for which one party to this Agreement is
entitled to indemnification from another party, the receiving party shall
promptly notify the other party in writing of the Tax Claim along with a copy
of the relevant Tax Claim notice; provided, that the failure by either party to
promptly notify the other of any such notice shall not release the other party
from its obligations under this Article VI in whole or in part except to the
extent that the Seller is materially and adversely prejudiced as a consequence
of such failure.

                  (b) With respect to Tax Claims for which the Seller would be
liable to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, the Seller may, upon
written notice to the Purchaser (such written notice to be provided within the
lesser of (i) thirty (30) days after notice thereof has been given to the
Indemnifying Party, and (ii) three (3) Business Days prior to the date required
to answer or respond to any such claim), assume and control the defense of such
Tax Claim at its own cost and expense and with its own counsel and the
Purchaser and its Affiliates agree to cooperate with the Seller in pursuing
such contest. If the Seller elects to assume the defense of any such Tax Claim,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) the Seller shall
consult with the Purchaser or its Affiliate and shall not enter into any
settlement with respect to any such Tax Claim without the Purchaser's (or its
Affiliate's) prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, or if such settlement would increase the Tax liability of
the Purchaser (or any of its Affiliates) or any of the Companies for any
taxable period for which the Seller has not indemnified the Purchaser pursuant
to Section 6.3, without the consent of the Purchaser (or its Affiliate); (ii)
the Seller shall keep the Purchaser informed of all material developments and
events relating to such Tax Claim (including promptly forwarding copies to the
Purchaser of any related correspondence and providing the Purchaser with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any related correspondence
prior to being sent by the Seller to any Tax Authority); and (iii) at its own
cost and expense, the Purchaser (or its Affiliate) shall have the right to
participate in (but not to control) the defense of such Tax Claim.

                  (c) In connection with the contest of any Tax Claim that
relates to (i) any Post-Closing Period, (ii) any Straddle Period and (iii) any
Tax Claim that the


                                      54
<PAGE>

Seller has the ability to control but does not timely elect to control pursuant
to Section 6.5(b), such contest shall be controlled by the Purchaser, and the
Seller agrees to cooperate fully with the Purchaser and its Affiliates in
pursuing such contest. In connection with any such contest that relates to (ii)
or (iii) above, the Purchaser or its Affiliate shall keep the Seller informed
of all material developments and events relating to such Tax Claim and the
Seller, at its own cost and expense, shall have the right to participate
(including participation in any relevant meetings) in (but not control) the
defense of such Tax Claim. If the Purchaser or its Affiliate controls the
contest of a claim, the Seller shall have the right to comment on any decision
to be made by the Purchaser or its Affiliate with respect to such claim prior
to such decision being made, and the Purchaser or its Affiliate shall, in good
faith, consider such comments in making any such decision. Nothing contained
herein shall be construed as limiting the Purchaser's (or any Purchaser
Indemnified Party's) right to indemnification under this Article VI.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the procedure for indemnification claims with regard to Taxes
or otherwise brought pursuant to this Article VI shall be governed exclusively
by this Section 6.5.

         SECTION 6.6       TRANSFER AND SIMILAR TAXES. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Seller shall assume and
promptly pay all sales, use, privilege, transfer, documentary, gains, stamp,
duties, recording and similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties, interest
or additions) imposed upon any party incurred in connection with the
transactions (including any Lease Assignment) contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the "TRANSFER TAXES"), and the Seller shall, at its own expense,
procure any stock transfer stamps required by, and accurately file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to, any Transfer
Tax.

         SECTION 6.7       INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED BY THE PURCHASER. With
respect to the taxable year of the Seller ending December 31, 2001 and the
period in 2002 prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser (or its Affiliate)
shall, to the extent that such information is available to the Purchaser (or
its Affiliates), as promptly as reasonably practicable cause the Companies to
prepare and provide to the Seller a package of Tax information materials ("TAX
PACKAGE"), which shall be completed in accordance with past practice including
past practice as to providing the information, schedules and work papers and as
to the method of computation of separate taxable income or other relevant
measure of income of the Companies.

         SECTION 6.8       TERMINATION OF TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. The Seller
hereby agrees and covenants that any and all existing tax allocation or sharing
agreements or arrangements, whether or not written, that may have been entered
into


                                      55
<PAGE>

by the Seller or its Affiliates and any of the Companies ("TAX SHARING
AGREEMENTS") shall be terminated on or before the Closing Date, and no payments
to or from any of the Companies pursuant to any such Tax Sharing Agreement
shall be made after such termination.

         SECTION 6.9       CONFLICTS; SURVIVAL. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations of the parties
hereto set forth in this Article VI shall: (a) be unconditional and absolute
and (b) remain in full force and effect indefinitely. In the event of a
conflict between this Article VI and any other provision of this Agreement,
this Article VI shall govern and control.

         SECTION 6.10      TAX TREATMENT. The parties hereto agree to treat any
payment made pursuant to Article VI and Article VII as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for all Tax purposes.

         SECTION 6.11      ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION. After the Closing, the
Seller and the Purchaser shall:

                  (a) assist (and cause their respective Affiliates to assist)
the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is
responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with this Article VI;

                  (b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or
disputes with taxing authorities regarding, any Tax Returns with respect to the
Companies;

                  (c) make available to the other and to any taxing authority
as reasonably requested all information, records, and documents relating to
Taxes of the Companies;

                  (d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any
pending or threatened tax audits or assessments with respect to the Companies
for taxable periods for which the other may have a liability under this Article
VI; and

                  (e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence

3.12 (h) shall survive the Closing until March 31, 2009. In the event notice of
any claim for indemnification under Sections 7.2(a)(i) or 7.3(a)(i) of this
Agreement shall have been given (within the meaning of Section 8.1) within the
applicable survival period, the representations and warranties that are the
subject of such indemnification claim shall survive until such time as such
claim is finally resolved.

                           (iv) any liabilities to third parties if and to the
extent arising out of or resulting from events or circumstances occurring or
existing prior to the Closing, including all Litigation, other than the
liabilities set forth on Schedule 7.2(a)(iv); and

                           (v) any (A) claims or rights reserved in Section 3
of the Consent Agreement, (B) claims for additional compensation for the
benefits to the Purchaser and/or the Companies under the Transitional Trademark
License Agreement or the restrictions imposed on the Seller and its Affiliates
(including St. Joe/Arvida Company, L.P.) pursuant to any of the Related
Agreements or the termination of the Prior Trademark License and (C) claims
seeking to question the validity of the Related Agreements or the right of the
Purchaser and its Affiliates to use the ARVIDA Mark in compliance with the
Transitional Trademark License Agreement or the termination of the Prior
Trademark License; provided, however, that the Seller shall not have any
indemnification obligation hereunder in respect of any such claims seeking to
enforce against the Purchaser or any of the Companies any term of any of the
Related Agreements by the Seller or St. Joe/Arvida Company, L.P., and the
foregoing shall not be interpreted as limiting in any way any of the Seller's
or St. Joe/Arvida Company, L.P.'s rights to enforce against the Purchaser or
the Companies any of the Related Agreements in accordance with their terms; and

                           (vi) any use by any Person (other than the Purchaser
and its Affiliates) of: (A) the ARVIDA Mark in the Business or in the
Commercial Businesses other than to the extent permitted under clause (A) of
Section 2(a) of the Use of Name Agreement; (B) ARVIDA REALTY, ARVIDA SERVICES,
ARVIDA REALTY SERVICES, ARVIDA REAL ESTATE OR ARVIDA REALTORS and any other
ARVIDA Mark currently used in the Business or formatives or confusingly similar
variations of the foregoing for any use, regardless of whether such use is in
or related to the Business, other than to the extent permitted under clause (A)
of Section 2(b) of the Use of Name Agreement; (C) any or all of the Internet
domain names and/or email addresses currently used by any of the Companies,
including arvidarealty.com, arvidaservices.com and arvidarealtyservices.com,
for any use, regardless of whether such use is in or related to the Business;
and (D) the trade dress currently used by the Companies, for any use,
regardless of whether such use is in or related to the Business. Notice of any
claim for indemnification under this Section 7.2(a)(vi) must be given by the
Purchaser on or prior to March 31, 2009.

For the purposes of this Section 7.2(a), the Seller shall not be obligated to
indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any incidental, consequential,
indirect, punitive, special or exemplary damages, or for lost profits,
unrealized expectations or other similar terms (except to the extent a
Purchaser Indemnified Party incurs Damages in respect of claims for such
damages by third parties; provided, that for purposes of


                                      58
<PAGE>

this Section 7.2, Damages shall include incidental or consequential damages,
including lost profits, with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant
to Section 7.2(a)(vi) or pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) based on any breach of
or inaccuracy in the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
3.12(h) and (i)). In addition, for the purposes of this Section 7.2(a), in
computing such individual or aggregate amounts of claims, the amount of each
claim shall be deemed to be an amount net of any insurance proceeds and any
indemnity, contribution or other similar payment, in each case recovered by the
Indemnified Party from any third party with respect thereto.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is hereby
understood and agreed that in the event of a breach of or inaccuracy in
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified by a
materiality or Material Adverse Effect exception or qualification, the amount
of Damages incurred by a Purchaser Indemnified Party as a result of such breach
(the existence of a breach being determined after giving effect to such
exception or qualification) shall be calculated as if such representation or
warranty were not subject to such exception or qualification.

                  The foregoing matters for which the Seller has an
indemnification obligation under this Section 7.2(a) are collectively referred
to herein as "SELLER INDEMNIFIABLE MATTERS".

                  (b) The Seller shall not be required to provide
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) (and, therefore, shall not be
liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party hereunder for any breach of
representation or warranty) unless and until the aggregate dollar amount of all
Damages that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i)
exceeds five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) ("SELLER'S DEDUCTIBLE
AMOUNT"), at which point the Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties only as to the amount of such Damages in excess of the Seller's
Deductible Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in this
Section 7.2(b) shall not apply with respect to any breach or inaccuracy in any
of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 (a),
3.5(b)(i), 3.7(a), 3.10, 3.12(g) and (h), 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16, 3.18(b) and
3.22, and Damages indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by Purchaser
Indemnified Parties with respect to breaches of or inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties set forth in such sections shall be disregarded
for purposes of the first sentence of this Section 7.2(b) in determining
whether the aggregate Damages exceed Seller's Deductible Amount as described
above).

                  (c) In connection with this Section 7.2, the Seller hereby
(i) waives any right of contribution or indemnification or similar right they
may have against any of the Companies for any amounts paid by the Seller
hereunder, and (ii) waives


                                      59
<PAGE>

any defense based on fault of any of the Companies; provided, that the
foregoing shall not be deemed to limit any claims that the Seller may have
against insurers under its insurance policies.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, in no event shall the Seller be liable for, or required to make any
payment, under this Section 7.2 in connection with any amount to the extent a
reduction in the Purchase Price was made because such item or amount was
included in the definition of "Indebtedness" for purposes of calculating the
Estimated Indebtedness or the Closing Date Indebtedness or that was included in
the definition of "Current Liabilities" for purposes of calculating the
Estimated Working Capital or the Closing Date Working Capital; and any such
items or amounts shall be excluded in determining whether the aggregate Damages
exceed the Seller's Deductible Amount pursuant to paragraph (b) above.

         SECTION 7.3       INDEMNIFICATION BY THE PURCHASER

                  (a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article VII, the
Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller and its
Affiliates, the representatives and agents thereof, and each of the successors
and permitted assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "SELLER
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES"), from and against any Damages suffered by the Seller
Indemnified Parties resulting from, arising out of, relating to or incurred
with respect to:

                           (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained in this Agreement; and

                           (ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is hereby
understood that for purposes of this Section 7.3, all materiality exceptions
and qualifications set forth in any representation or warranty of the Purchaser
contained in this Agreement shall be disregarded.

                  The foregoing matters for which the Purchaser has an
indemnification obligation under this Section 7.3(a) are collectively referred
to herein as "PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED MATTERS".

                  (b) The Purchaser shall not be required to pay any amount of
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.3(a)(i) until the aggregate dollar amount
of all Damages that would otherwise be indemnifiable pursuant to Section
7.3(a)(i) exceeds five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) ("PURCHASER'S
DEDUCTIBLE


                                      60
<PAGE>

AMOUNT"), at which point the Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified
Parties only as to the amount of such Damages in excess of the Purchaser's
Deductible Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the limitations in this
Section 7.3(b) shall not apply with respect to any breach or inaccuracy in any
of the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.3, and
Damages indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by Seller Indemnified
Parties with respect to breaches or inaccuracies in the representations or
warranties set forth in such sections shall be disregarded for purposes of the
first sentence of this Section 7.3(b) in determining whether the aggregate
Damages exceed Purchaser's Deductible Amount as described above.

         SECTION 7.4       NOTICE AND RESOLUTION OF CLAIM.

                  (a) The Seller Indemnified Parties or the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties (each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), as the case may be, shall
promptly give written notice to the indemnifying party (the "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY") after obtaining knowledge of any third party claim or Litigation
against the Indemnified Party or as to which recovery may be sought against the
Indemnifying Party because of the indemnities set forth in Sections 7.2 or 7.3,
specifying in reasonable detail the third party claim or Litigation and the
basis for indemnification; provided, that the failure of an Indemnified Party
promptly to notify the Indemnifying Party of any such matter shall not release
the indemnifying party, in whole or in part, from its obligations under this
Article VII except to the extent the Indemnified Party's failure to so notify
in breach of this Section 7.4 materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party's
ability to defend against such third party claim or Litigation. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of any such third
party claim (other than (i) claims with respect to Litigation, (A) pending or
threatened as of the Closing or (B) otherwise related to the ordinary course
conduct of the Business prior to the Closing of a nature typically tendered by
the Companies to their errors and omissions insurance carrier and actually
tendered to the carrier under the insurance policy referred to in Section
2.4(a)(xvii) (the "PRE-CLOSING LITIGATION") other than as set forth on Schedule
7.4 and (ii) with respect to Taxes which are covered by Article VI), at its own
cost and expense, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party
by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party of its agreement to assume
such defense within the lesser of (i) thirty (30) days after notice thereof has
been given to the Indemnifying Party, and (ii) three (3) Business Days prior to
the date required to answer or respond to any such claim (the "ELECTION
PERIOD"). Failure by the Indemnifying Party to notify the Indemnified Party of
its election to assume the defense of any such claim by a third party within
the Election Period shall be deemed a waiver by the Indemnifying Party of its
right to assume the defense of such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party
may defend or settle such claim in such manner and on such terms as the
Indemnified Party may deem


                                      61
<PAGE>

appropriate and any Damages of the Indemnified Party shall be the liability of
the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

                  (b) The Purchaser shall manage the Pre-Closing Litigation in
the ordinary course and shall reasonably defend or settle such claims. The
Purchaser shall not enter into any settlement of Pre-Closing Litigation without
the consent of the Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld) if the amount to be
paid in settlement of such claim is not covered by insurance (excluding any
deductible).

                  (c) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any such
third party claim, the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under this
Agreement shall include taking all steps necessary in the investigation,
defense or settlement of such claim (including the retention of legal counsel)
and holding the Indemnified Party harmless from and against any and all Damages
caused by or arising out of any settlement approved by the Indemnifying Party
or any judgment in connection with such claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
not, in the defense of such claim, consent to entry of any judgment (except
with the written consent of the Indemnified Party), or enter into any
settlement (except with the written consent of the Indemnified Party): (i) that
does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party(ies) a complete release from all
liability of the Indemnified Party(ies) in respect of such claim; or (ii) the
effect of which is to permit any injunction, declaratory judgment, other order
or other equitable relief to be entered, directly or indirectly, against any
Indemnified Party, or admit to any wrongdoing, whether civil or criminal in
nature. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party as to the
existence of any offers to settle such claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall
not settle a claim, or refuse to settle a claim, if to the knowledge of the
Indemnifying Party (after notifying and consulting with the Indemnified Party)
such action or inaction would reasonably be expected to have a materially
adverse impact on the Indemnified Party or the Business. The Indemnifying Party
shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate in such defense or settlement
through counsel chosen by the Indemnified Party, with the fees and expenses of
such counsel borne by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense or settlement thereof, and
the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. If the Indemnifying
Party elects to direct the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay any part of any claim or demand arising from
such asserted liability unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld) to such payment or unless the
Indemnifying Party withdraws from the defense of such asserted liability or
unless a final judgment is entered against the Indemnified Party for such
liability.

                  (d) The Purchaser agrees to cooperate, and to cause each of
the Companies to cooperate, with the Seller in connection with the
investigation, negotiation, preparation for and/or defense of any third party
claim subject to indemnity hereunder, which cooperation shall include providing
the Seller with access to their employees and agents and with access to and the
opportunity to copy and otherwise use any documents or other records held by
any of them or otherwise under their control, in each case as the Seller may
reasonably request. In addition, the Purchaser agrees to make available to the
Seller those documents within its possession or control relating to any Claim
(as defined in the Consent Agreement) that may be requested by the Seller,
acting reasonably, to the extent required to be made available to JMB Southeast
Development, L.L.C., St. Joe/Arvida Company, L.P. and their respective
Affiliates under the Consent Agreement in connection with any Claim; provided,
that no such information that is proprietary, competitive or of another
sensitive nature shall be required to be provided by the Purchaser hereunder
unless the Seller and JMB Southeast Development, L.L.C., St. Joe/Arvida
Company, L.P. and their respective Affiliates, as applicable, enter into
customary confidentiality arrangements for the benefit of the Purchaser
acceptable to the Purchaser acting reasonably. The Seller agrees to reimburse
the Purchaser and the Companies for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with the foregoing.

                  (e) If the Indemnified Party has been fully indemnified by
the Indemnifying Party for its Damages in respect of a third party claim and
the Indemnified Party has a cause of action against the third party raising the
claim or another third party, then the Indemnified Party shall assign any such
claim to the Indemnifying Party, to the extent any such claim is capable of
assignment and without making any representation as to or bearing any
responsibility for the effectiveness of such assignment.

         SECTION 7.5       INDEMNITY PAYMENTS. All indemnity payments payable
under this Agreement ("INDEMNITY PAYMENTS"), shall be paid in immediately
available funds within five (5) Business Days after the later of (i) final
determination and written request therefor by the Indemnified Party. All such
Indemnity Payments shall be made to the accounts and in the manner specified in
writing by the party entitled to such Indemnity Payments.

         SECTION 7.6       EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Subject to Article VI, in the
absence of fraud or an intentional misrepresentation, the indemnification
provided by this Article VII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect
of the Purchaser Indemnifiable Matters and the Seller Indemnifiable Matters. In
the absence of fraud or an intentional misrepresentation, the Seller's sole and
exclusive recourse in respect of any Purchaser Indemnifiable Matter shall be
pursuant to Section 7.3 of this Agreement, and subject to Article VI, the
Mortgage Purchaser's and the Purchaser's


                                      63
<PAGE>

sole and exclusive recourse in respect of any Seller Indemnifiable Matter shall
be pursuant to Section 7.2 of this Agreement.

                                   EXHIBIT A

                                TAX CERTIFICATE

                  Section 1445 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that a
transferee of a U.S. real property interest must withhold tax if the transferor
is a foreign person. To inform the transferee that withholding of tax is not
required upon the disposition of a U.S. real property interest by [Seller], the
undersigned hereby certifies the following on behalf of [Seller].

                  1.       [Seller] is not a foreign corporation, foreign
                           partnership, foreign trust, or foreign estate (as
                           those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code
                           and Income Tax Regulations);

                  2.       [Seller's] U.S. employer identification number is
                           ___________, and

                  3.       [Seller's] office address is:

                           _____________________________________________________

                           _____________________________________________________

                  [Seller] understands that this certification may be disclosed
to the Internal Revenue Service by transferee and that any false statement
contained herein could be punished by fine, imprisonment, or both.

                  Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined
this certification and to the best of my knowledge and belief it is true,
correct, and complete, and I further declare that I have authority to sign this
document on behalf of [Seller].


                                            Signature:  ________________________



                                            Signed by:  ________________________
