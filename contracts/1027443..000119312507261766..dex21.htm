-3- ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 _Effect on Galaxy Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Galaxy Merger and without any action on the part of the parties
hereto or the holders of any securities of any of the parties hereto:

(a) _Conversion of Galaxy Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of Galaxy outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (such shares, together, unless the context clearly otherwise requires,
with the associated Rights, collectively, the " _Galaxy Common Stock_ ," and
each, a " _Galaxy Share_ "), other than Galaxy Shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive, either (i) that number of fully paid and non-assessable common
shares, par value $.001 per share, of Holdco (such shares, the " _Holdco
Common Stock_ ," and each, a " _Holdco Share_ ") equal to the Exchange Ratio
(the " _Per Share Stock Consideration_ ") or (ii) $6.35 in cash without
interest thereon (the " _Per Share Cash Consideration_ " and, together with
the Per Share Stock Consideration, the " _Galaxy Consideration_ "), as
determined in accordance with Section 2.1(e).

(b) _Cancellation of Converted Shares_. All Galaxy Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive either the Per Share Stock Consideration
or the Per Share Cash Consideration as provided in this Section 2.1 shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such
Galaxy Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Galaxy
Shares other than the right to receive (i) the consideration to which such
holder may be entitled pursuant to this Section 2.1, (ii) any dividends and
other distributions in accordance with Section 2.3(e); and (iii) any cash to
be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Holdco Common Stock in accordance
with Section 2.3(f).

(c) _Galaxy and Mars-Owned Shares_. Each Galaxy Share held in the treasury of
Galaxy or that is owned by Mars immediately prior to the Effective Time (in
each case, other than any such Galaxy Shares held on behalf of third parties
or held in trust to fund Galaxy or Mars obligations) (the " _Cancelled Shares_
") shall be cancelled and retired without any conversion thereof and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such
cancellation and retirement.

(d) _Conversion of Galaxy Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Galaxy Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Galaxy Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Galaxy Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock
of Galaxy Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number
of shares of common stock of the Galaxy Surviving Corporation into which they
were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.



 

-4- (e) _Election Procedures_.

(i) An election form and other appropriate and customary transmittal materials
in such form as Galaxy and Mars shall mutually agree (the " _Election Form_
") shall be mailed, together with appropriate transmittal materials, at the
time of mailing to holders of record of Galaxy Common Stock of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus in connection with the Galaxy Meeting (the " _Mailing
Date_ ") to each holder of record of Galaxy Common Stock as of the close of
the fifth Business Day prior to the Mailing Date (the " _Election Form Record
Date_ ").

(ii) Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the beneficial owner
through appropriate and customary documentation and instructions) to specify
(A) the number of shares of such holders Galaxy Common Stock with respect to
which such holder elects to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration (the "
_Stock Election Shares_ "), (B) the number of shares of such holders Galaxy
Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the Per Share
Cash Consideration (the " _Cash Election Shares_ ") or (C) that such holder
makes no election with respect to such holders Galaxy Common Stock (the "
_No Election Shares_ "). Any Galaxy Common Stock with respect to which the
Exchange Agent has not received an effective, properly completed Election Form
on or before 5:00 p.m., on the Business Day immediately prior to the day of
the Galaxy Meeting (the " _Election Deadline_ ") shall be deemed to be No
Election Shares.

(iii) Mars shall make available one or more Election Forms as may reasonably
be requested from time to time by any person who becomes a holder (or
beneficial owner) of Galaxy Common Stock between the Election Form Record
Date and the close of business on the day prior to the Election Deadline, and
Galaxy shall provide the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary
for it to perform as specified herein.

(iv) Any such election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange
Agent shall have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the
Election Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more Certificates (or customary affidavits and
indemnification regarding the destruction of such Certificates or the
guaranteed delivery of such Certificates and, if required by the Exchange
Agent, the posting by the holder of such Certificate of a bond in customary
amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate) representing all shares of Galaxy Common Stock covered
by such Election Form, together with duly executed transmittal materials
included in the Election Form. Any Election Form may be revoked or changed by
the person submitting such Election Form, only by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. In the event an Election
Form is revoked prior to the Election Deadline, unless a subsequent properly
completed Election Form is submitted and actually received by the
Exchange Agent by the Election Deadline, the shares of Galaxy Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall become No Election Shares and Mars
shall cause the Certificates to be promptly returned without charge to the
person submitting the Election Form upon written request to that effect from
the holder who submitted the Election Form. Subject to the terms of this
Agreement  



 

-5-  and of the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable
discretion in consultation with Mars to determine whether any election,
revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to disregard
immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith decision of Mars
regarding such matters shall be binding and conclusive. Neither Holdco, Mars,
Galaxy nor the Exchange Agent shall be under any obligation to notify any
person of any defect in an Election Form.

(v) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Mars shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to effect the allocation among the holders of Galaxy Common
Stock of rights to receive Holdco Common Stock or cash in the Galaxy Merger in
accordance with the Election Forms as follows: 

A. _Cash Oversubscribed_. If the aggregate cash amount that would otherwise be
paid upon the conversion of the Cash Election Shares in the Galaxy Merger is
greater than the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then:

I. all Stock Election Shares and No Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration;

II. the Exchange Agent shall then select from among the Cash Election Shares,
by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of shares to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration (the " _Stock Designated Shares_ ") such that
the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Galaxy Merger equals as
closely as practicable the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all Stock
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration; and

III. the Cash Election Shares that are not Stock Designated Shares will be
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration.

B. _Cash Undersubscribed_. If the aggregate cash amount that would be paid
upon conversion of the Cash Election Shares in the Galaxy Merger is less than
the Aggregate Cash Consideration, then:

I. all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Per Share Cash Consideration;

II. the Exchange Agent shall then select first from among the No Election
Shares, by a random selection process, and then (if necessary) from among the
Stock Election Shares, by a pro rata selection process, a sufficient number of
shares to receive the Per Share Cash Consideration (such selected No Election
Shares and selected Stock Election Shares, the " _Cash Designated Shares_ ")
such that the aggregate cash amount that will be paid in the Galaxy Merger
equals as closely as practicable the Aggregate Cash Consideration, and all
Cash Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Cash Consideration; and



 

-6- III. the Stock Election Shares and the No Election shares that are not Cash
Designated Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration.

C. _Cash Subscriptions Sufficient_. If the aggregate cash amount that would
be paid upon conversion in the Galaxy Merger of the Cash Election Shares
equals as closely as practicable (as determined by the Exchange Agent) the
Aggregate Cash Consideration, then subparagraphs (A) and (B) above shall not
apply and all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash Consideration and all Stock Election Shares and No
Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Stock Consideration. The pro rata selection process to be used by the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(v)(A) or Section 2.1(e)(v)(B) shall consist
of such equitable proration processes as shall be mutually determined by Mars
and Galaxy.

(f) _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Mars or Galaxy, or in the securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of capital stock of Mars or
Galaxy, shall occur as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock
distribution with a record date during such period, merger or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration and any number or amount contained in
this Agreement which is based on the price of Mars Common Stock or Galaxy
Common Stock or the number of shares of Mars Common Stock or Galaxy Common
Stock, as the case may be, shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 2.1(f) shall be construed to
permit Galaxy to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

(g) _Dissenters  Rights_. Any provision of this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, if required by the DGCL (but only to the extent required
thereby), Galaxy Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares) and that are held by holders
of such Galaxy Shares who have properly exercised appraisal rights with
respect thereto in accordance with, and who have complied with, Section 262 of
the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") will not be converted into the right to
receive the Galaxy Consideration, and holders of such Dissenting Shares will
be entitled to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until any
such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses such right, such
Dissenting Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into
and have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive
the Per Share Stock Consideration in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the Agreement. At the Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Section 262 of the DGCL and as provided in the previous sentence. Galaxy will
give Mars, before or at the Effective Time, or Holdco, following the Effective
Time, (i) prompt notice of any demands received by Galaxy for appraisals of
Galaxy Shares, any withdrawal of any such  



 

-7-  demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to Galaxy prior
to the Effective Time that relate to such demand and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such notices and demands. Galaxy shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Mars, before or at the Effective Time, or Holdco, following the
Effective Time (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
settle any such demands.

Section 2.2 _Effect on Mars Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Mars Merger and without any action on the part of the parties hereto or
the holders of any securities of any of the parties hereto:

(a) _Conversion of Mars Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Mars outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(such shares, together, unless the context clearly otherwise requires, with
the associated Rights, collectively, the " _Mars Common Stock_ ," and each, a
" _Mars Share_ "), other than Mars Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
2.2(c), shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive one fully paid and non-assessable Holdco Share (the "
_Mars Consideration_ " and, together with the Galaxy Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

(b) _Cancellation of Converted Shares_. All Mars Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive Holdco Shares as provided in this Section
2.2 shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist, and the holders
of certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
such Mars Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Mars
Shares other than the right to receive the consideration to which such holder
may be entitled pursuant to this Section 2.2.

(c) _Galaxy and Mars-Owned Shares_. Each Mars Share held in the treasury of
Mars or that is owned by Holdco immediately prior to the Effective Time (in
each case, other than any such Mars Shares held on behalf of third parties or
held in trust to fund Mars or Galaxy obligations) shall be cancelled and
retired without any conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation and
retirement. Each Holdco Share that is owned by Mars or any direct or indirect
wholly owned subsidiary of Mars shall be cancelled and retired without any
conversion thereof and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange for such cancellation and retirement.

(d) _Conversion of Mars Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, of Mars Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Mars Surviving Corporation with the same rights,
powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Mars Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Effective Time, all certificates representing the common stock
of Mars Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the number of
shares of common stock of the Mars Surviving Corporation into which they were
converted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.



 

-8- Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Holdco shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company (and pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Mars and Galaxy) (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), in trust for the
benefit of holders of the Galaxy Shares, certificates representing shares of
Holdco Common Stock and an amount of cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to be
issued and paid pursuant to the provisions of this Article II in exchange for
all of the Galaxy Shares (including the Galaxy Restricted Shares, but
excluding the Cancelled Shares) outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, issuable and payable upon due surrender of the certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Galaxy Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-
certificated Galaxy Shares represented by book-entry (the " _Book-Entry
Shares_ ") (such cash and certificates representing shares of Holdco Common
Stock, the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Galaxy Common Stock that have been converted into
the right to receive the Galaxy Consideration shall be entitled to receive,
upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a
properly completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer
as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, (A) a certificate for Holdco Shares and/or a check or wire transfer in
the amount to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to this Article
II, (B) any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section
2.3(d); and (C) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Holdco
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(f). The shares of Holdco Common
Stock constituting part of such Galaxy Consideration, at Holdcos option,
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical certificate is
requested by a holder of shares of Galaxy Common Stock or is otherwise
required under applicable Law. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after
the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Galaxy
Consideration.

(c) If permitted by Section 251(g) of the DGCL, certificates representing
shares of Mars Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, represent the shares of Holdco
Common Stock constituting the Mars Consideration. At the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall exchange by book entry transfer all uncertificated shares
of Mars Common Stock (excluding any shares of Mars Common Stock to be
canceled pursuant to Section 2.2(c)) for the shares of Holdco Common Stock
constituting the Mars Consideration. No separate certificates shall be issued
in exchange for Mars Common Stock in accordance with Section 251(g) of DGCL.

(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be issued or paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such
issuance or payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry
Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required
as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.



 

-9- (e) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Holdco
Common Stock issued in the Mergers shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Certificates or Book-Entry Shares until such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares are surrendered as provided in this Section 2.3. Following
such surrender, subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable
Law, there shall be paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares
of Holdco Common Stock issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such
surrender, an amount equal to all dividends and other distributions payable
in respect of such shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date on or
after the Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
an amount equal to the dividends or other distributions payable with respect
to such shares of Holdco Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time but with a payment date subsequent to such surrender. Subject to the
immediately preceding sentence, for purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of shares of Holdco Common Stock, all shares of
Holdco Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Mergers shall be entitled to
dividends as if issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time.

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock shall
be issued in the Mergers. All fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock that a
holder of Galaxy Shares would otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of
the Galaxy Merger shall be aggregated and if a fractional share results from
such aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof,
an amount in cash without interest thereon determined by multiplying such
fraction by the closing sales price of one share of Mars Common Stock on the
Nasdaq Global Select Market two Business Days prior to the Closing Date. All
fractional shares of Holdco Common Stock that a holder of Mars Shares would
otherwise be entitled to receive as a result of the Mars Merger shall be
aggregated and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, such
holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash
without interest thereon determined by multiplying such fraction by the
closing sales price of one share of Mars Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market two Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(g) _Payment Procedures_.

A. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the second Business Day following the Closing Date, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Galaxy Shares whose
Galaxy Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.1, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof and,
if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by the holder of such
Certificate of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate) or Book-Entry Shares
to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions
as Mars and Galaxy may mutually agree), and (B) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by the holder
of such Certificate of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate) or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.



 

-10- B. Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by the holder of
such Certificate of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate) or Book-Entry
Shares to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly
completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto,
and such other documents as may customarily be required by the Exchange Agent,
the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor a certificate for Holdco Shares and/or a check or
wire transfer in the amount to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to
this Article II. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable
upon due surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof and, if required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by the holder of
such Certificate of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate) or Book-
Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Galaxy Shares or Mars
Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of Galaxy or Mars,
respectively, the Merger Consideration to be issued and/or paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Galaxy Shares or Mars Shares is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(h) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of Galaxy and Mars shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of the Galaxy Shares or Mars Shares, respectively,
that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Galaxy
Surviving Corporation, Mars Surviving Corporation, or Holdco for transfer,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for (i) the Merger Consideration, (ii)
any dividends and other distributions in accordance with Section 2.3(e); and
(iii) any cash to be paid in lieu of any fractional share of Holdco Common
Stock in accordance with Section 2.3(f).

(i) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of Galaxy Shares for one year after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Holdco upon demand, and any former
holders of Galaxy Shares who have not surrendered their Galaxy Shares
in accordance with this Section 2.3 shall thereafter look only to Holdco for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon due surrender of their Galaxy Shares.

(j) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
Galaxy, Mars, Holdco, the Merger Subs, the Galaxy Surviving Corporation, the
Mars Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be
liable to any former holder of Galaxy Shares or Mars Shares for any amount
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.



 

-11- (k) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Holdco; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that if at any time prior to the termination of the Exchange Fund pursuant to
Section 2.3(i), the value of the cash in the Exchange Fund is reduced below
the amount necessary to pay the cash component of any unpaid Merger
Consideration, amounts in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section
2.3(f), and dividends and distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.3(e),
Holdco shall immediately deposit additional funds into the Exchange Fund
sufficient to correct this deficiency. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to Holdco pursuant to Section 2.3(i).

(l) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a certificate for Holdco Shares
and/or a check or wire transfer in the amount to which such holder may be
entitled pursuant to this Article II in respect of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate.

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Galaxy Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

(a) Each option to purchase Galaxy Shares (collectively, the " _Galaxy Stock
Options_ ") granted under the employee and director stock plans of Galaxy
(the " _Galaxy Stock Plans_ ") or otherwise, whether vested or unvested, that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will at the Effective
Time be cancelled and the holder of such Galaxy Stock Option will, in full
settlement of such Galaxy Stock Option, receive from the Galaxy Surviving
Corporation an amount (subject to any applicable withholding Tax) in cash
(without interest thereon) equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any, of
the Per Share Cash Consideration over the exercise price per Galaxy Share of
such Galaxy Stock Option multiplied by (y) the total number of Galaxy Shares
subject to such Galaxy Stock Option (the aggregate amount of such cash, the "
_Option Consideration_ "). Holdco shall cause the Galaxy Surviving Corporation
to pay the holders of Galaxy Stock Options the cash payments described in this
Section 2.4(a) as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but
with respect to the employees of Galaxy and its Subsidiaries located in the
United States only, in no event later than three (3) Business Days following
the Closing Date.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each award of restricted Galaxy
Common Stock (the " _Galaxy Restricted Shares_ ") shall vest in full and be
converted into the right to receive the Galaxy Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1(a).



 

-12- (c) At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit granted under a Galaxy
Stock Plan or otherwise (a " _Galaxy Stock-Based Award_ "), whether vested or
unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to represent a restricted stock unit with respect to shares of Galaxy
Common Stock, shall become fully vested and shall entitle the holder thereof
to receive an amount in cash (without interest thereon) equal to the Per Share
Cash Consideration in respect of each Galaxy Share underlying a particular
Galaxy Stock-Based Award (the aggregate amount of such cash, together with
the Option Consideration, the " _Option and Stock-Based Consideration_ "). The
Galaxy Surviving Corporation shall pay the holders of Galaxy Stock-Based
Awards the cash payments described in this Section 2.4(c) as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, but with respect to employees
of Galaxy and its Subsidiaries located in the United States only, in no event
later than three (3) Business Days following the Closing Date.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, Galaxy will adopt such resolutions as may
reasonably be required in its discretion (and with the reasonable approval of
Mars) to effectuate the actions contemplated by this Section 2.4.

Section 2.5 _Treatment of Mars Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards;
Treatment of Mars Warrants_.

(a) Each option to purchase Mars Shares (collectively, the " _Mars Stock
Options_ ") granted under the employee and director equity compensation plans
of Mars (excluding the Mars ESPP, the " _Mars Stock Plans_ ") or otherwise,
shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into an option to acquire, on the
same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting provisions) as were
applicable under the Mars Stock Option, that number of Holdco Shares equal to
the number of Mars Shares subject to such Mars Stock Option immediately prior
to the Effective Time, at a price per share equal to the per share exercise or
purchase price specified in such Mars Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time and such converted option shall be assumed by Holdco. 

(b) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted Mars Common Stock (the "
_Mars Restricted Shares_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted on a one-for-one basis into restricted
Holdco Shares, subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting
requirements) as were applicable to the Mars Restricted Shares in respect
of which they are issued.

(c) At and after the Effective Time, any right to purchase Mars Shares under
the Macrovision Corporation 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (" _Mars ESPP_
") shall be converted into the right to purchase Holdco Shares, subject to the
same terms and conditions as were applicable under the Mars ESPP and such
purchase rights shall be assumed by Holdco.

(d) Each warrant to purchase Mars Shares (collectively, the " _Mars Warrants_
") shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a warrant to purchase, on
the same terms and conditions (including exercisability requirements) as were
applicable under the Mars Warrant, that number of Holdco Shares equal to the
number of Mars Shares subject to such Mars Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time, at a price per share equal to the per share exercise or
purchase price specified in such Mars Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time.



 

-13- (e) Prior to the Effective Time, Holdco and Mars shall take all necessary
action to assume as of the Effective Time all of the obligations undertaken

statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or, including if Form S-8 is not
available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Holdco
Common Stock subject to such Mars Stock Options and purchase rights under the
Mars ESPP and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such options, purchase
rights or restricted shares remain outstanding.

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, Holdco
shall deliver to the holders of Mars Stock Options and purchase rights under
the Mars ESPP appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant
to the respective Mars Stock Plans and the Mars ESPP and agreements
evidencing the grants of or rights in such Mars Stock Options and purchase
rights under the Mars ESPP and stating that such Mars Stock Options and

are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted and paid over to the
applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld or deducted amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
holder, in respect of which such deduction and withholding were made.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF GALAXY

Except as disclosed in the Galaxy SEC Documents or in the disclosure schedule
delivered by Galaxy to Mars prior to the execution of this Agreement
and attached hereto (the " _Galaxy Disclosure Schedule_ "), Galaxy represents
and warrants to Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs as follows:

Section 3.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._

(a) Each of Galaxy and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization  



 

-14-  and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing
as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so organized, validly existing,
qualified or in good standing, or to have such power or authority, would not
have a Galaxy Material Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, any
reference to any fact, circumstance, event, effect or change having a "
_Galaxy Material Adverse Effect_ " means a fact, circumstance, event, effect
or change that is materially adverse to the business or financial condition of
Galaxy and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but shall not include (i)
events or effects relating to or resulting from (A) changes in general
economic or political conditions or the securities, credit or financial
markets to the extent such changes do not have a materially disproportionate
impact on Galaxy and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to its
competitors; (B) changes or developments in the industries in which Galaxy and
its Subsidiaries operate to the extent such changes or developments do
not disproportionately impact Galaxy relative to its competitors, (C) changes
in Law; (D) effects resulting from the failure to take any actions (or refrain
from any omissions) as to which Galaxy has requested Mars consent pursuant
to Sections 5.1(a) or (b) and to which Mars did not consent; (E) the identity
of Mars or any of its affiliates as acquiror of Galaxy; (F) compliance with
the terms of, or the taking of any actions required to be taken by, this
Agreement, or actions or omissions of Galaxy or any of its Subsidiaries that
Mars has expressly requested or to which Mars has expressly consented; (G) any
acts of terrorism or war; (H) changes in generally accepted accounting
principles or the interpretation thereof; (I) any litigation relating to the
announcement, negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby; or (J) any actions by the executive officers
of Mars, or actions by other employees or representatives of Mars that Galaxy
can demonstrate were directed by or attributable to Mars; or (ii) any failure
to meet internal or published projections, forecasts or revenue or earning
predictions for any period (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the
underlying facts and circumstances).

(b) Section 3.1(b) of the Galaxy Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and correct list of each material Subsidiary of Galaxy. Section 3.1(b) of the
Galaxy Disclosure Schedule also sets forth the jurisdiction of organization
and percentage of outstanding equity interests (including partnership
interests and limited liability company interests) owned by Galaxy or its
Subsidiaries of each such Subsidiary. All equity interests (including
partnership interests and limited liability company interests) of such
Subsidiaries held by Galaxy or by any other Subsidiary have been duly and
validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
were not issued in violation of any preemptive or similar rights, purchase
option, call or right of first refusal or similar rights. All such equity
interests owned by Galaxy or its Subsidiaries are free and clear of any Liens,
other than Permitted Liens and restrictions imposed by applicable Law. Other
than Galaxys Subsidiaries, neither Galaxy nor any of its Subsidiaries owns
any capital stock or, or other equity or voting interests of any nature in,
or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, capital
stock of, or other equity or voting interests of any nature in, any other
person.

(c) Galaxy has delivered or made available to Mars a copy of the certificate
or articles of incorporation and by-laws (or like organizational
documents) of Galaxy and each of its material Subsidiaries, and each such
copy is true, correct and complete and each such  



 

-15-  instrument is in full force and effect. Except as would not have a Galaxy
Material Adverse Effect, Galaxy is not in violation of any of the provisions
of its certificate of incorporation or by-laws and each material Subsidiary
is not in violation of any of the provisions of its respective certificate or
articles of incorporation or by-laws (or like organizational documents).

Section 3.2 _Capital Stock_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of Galaxy consists of 2,350,000,000 shares
of Galaxy Common Stock and 150,000,000 shares of preferred stock (the "

set forth in subsection (a) above and (ii) except as set forth in the Second
Amended and Restated Rights Agreement, dated as of July 12, 2000, between
Galaxy and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "
_Rights Agreement_ "), there are no outstanding subscriptions, options,
warrants, calls, convertible securities or other similar rights, agreements or
commitments relating to the issuance of capital stock to which Galaxy or any
of Galaxys Subsidiaries is a party obligating Galaxy or any of Galaxys
Subsidiaries to (A) issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or
other equity interests of Galaxy or any Subsidiary of Galaxy or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, (B)
grant, extend or enter into any such subscription, option, warrant, call,
convertible securities or other similar right, agreement or arrangement, (C)
redeem or otherwise acquire any such shares of capital stock or other equity
interests, or (D) provide a material amount of funds to, or make any material
investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in,
any Subsidiary. Except for the issuance of shares of Galaxy Common Stock that
were available for issuance as set forth in subsection (a) above, from
September 30, 2007 to the date hereof, Galaxy has not declared or paid any
dividend or distribution in respect of the Galaxy Common Stock, and has not
issued, sold, repurchased, redeemed or otherwise acquired any Galaxy Common
Stock, and its Board of Directors has not authorized any of the foregoing.

(c) Except for awards to acquire shares of Galaxy Common Stock under any
Galaxy Stock Plan, neither Galaxy nor any of its Subsidiaries has
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations, the holders of
which have the right to vote (or that are convertible into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Galaxy on any
matter.



 

-16- (d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
Galaxy or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of
the capital stock or other equity interest of Galaxy or any of its
Subsidiaries or granting any person the right to elect, or to designate or
nominate for election, a director to the Board of Directors of Galaxy or any
of its material Subsidiaries.

Section 3.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement; No Violation_.

(a) Galaxy has requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this
Agreement and, subject to receipt of Galaxy Stockholder Approval, to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Board of Directors of

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MARS, HOLDCO AND THE MERGER SUBS

Except as disclosed in the Mars SEC Documents or in the disclosure schedule
delivered by Mars to Galaxy prior to the execution of this Agreement
and attached hereto (the  



 

-28-  " _Mars Disclosure Schedule_ "), Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs jointly
and severally represent and warrant to Galaxy as follows:

 



Section 4.1 _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries, etc._  

(a) Each of Mars, Holdco, the Merger Subs and Mars Subsidiaries is a legal
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate
or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted and is qualified
to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except
where the failure to be so organized, validly existing, qualified or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, would not have a Mars Material
Adverse Effect. As used in this Agreement, any reference to any fact,
circumstance, event, effect or change having a " _Mars Material Adverse
Effect_ " means a fact, circumstance, event, effect or change that is
materially adverse to the business or financial condition of Mars (or, after
the Effective Time, Holdco) and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, but shall
not include (i) events or effects relating to or resulting from (A) changes in
general economic or political conditions or the securities, credit or
financial markets to the extent such changes do not have a
materially disproportionate impact on Mars and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, relative to its competitors; (B) changes or developments in the
industries in which Mars and its Subsidiaries operate to the extent such
changes or developments do not disproportionately impact Mars relative to its
competitors; (C) changes in Law; (D) effects resulting from the failure to
take any actions (or refrain from any omissions) as to which Mars has
requested Galaxys consent pursuant to Section 5.1(c) or (d) and to which
Galaxy did not consent; (E) the identity of Mars or any of its affiliates as
acquiror of Galaxy; (F) compliance with the terms of, or the taking of any
actions required to be taken by, this Agreement, or actions or omissions of
Mars or any of its Subsidiaries that Galaxy has expressly requested or to
which Galaxy has expressly consented; (G) any acts of terrorism or war; (H)
changes in generally accepted accounting principles or the interpretation
thereof; (I) any litigation relating to the announcement, negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; or (J) any actions by the executive officers of Galaxy, or actions by
other employees or representatives of Galaxy that Mars can demonstrate were
directed by or attributable to Galaxy; or (ii) any failure to meet internal or
published projections, forecasts or revenue or earning predictions for
any period (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not the underlying facts and
circumstances).

(b) All equity interests (including partnership interests and limited
liability company interests) of the material Subsidiaries of Mars held by Mars
or by any other Subsidiary of Mars have been duly and validly authorized and
are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and were not issued in
violation of any preemptive or similar rights, purchase option, call or right
of first refusal or similar rights. All such equity interests owned by Mars or
its Subsidiaries are free and clear of any Liens, other than Permitted Liens
and restrictions imposed by applicable Law. Other than the Subsidiaries,
neither Mars nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any capital stock or, or other
equity or voting interests of any nature in, or any interest convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for, capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests of any nature in, any other person.



 

-29- (c) Mars has delivered or made available to Galaxy a copy of the certificate
or articles of incorporation and by-laws (or like organizational documents)
of Mars and each of its material Subsidiaries, and each such copy is true,
correct and complete and each such instrument is in full force and effect.
Except as would not have a Mars Material Adverse Effect, Mars is not in
violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation or by-
laws and each material Subsidiary is not in violation of any of the provisions
of its respective certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws (or
like organizational documents).

Stock Plan, neither Mars nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations, the holders of which have the right
to vote (or that are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of Mars on any matter.



 

-30- (d) There are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which
Mars or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting of the
capital stock or other equity interest of Mars or any of its Subsidiaries or

Section 4.3 _Corporate Authority Relative to This Agreement; No Violation_.

(a) Each of Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs has all requisite corporate power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and, subject to receipt of the
Mars Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Boards of Directors of Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs, and the Board of
Directors of Mars has resolved to recommend that the stockholders of Mars
approve the issuance of shares of Holdco Common Stock in the Mergers (the "
_Mars Recommendation_ ") and directed that such matter be submitted for
consideration of the stockholders of Mars at the Mars Meeting. The Board of
Directors of each of Holdco and the Merger Subs has approved the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Mergers. Except for the Mars
Stockholder Approval, the adoption of this Agreement by Mars as the sole
stockholder of Holdco, the adoption of this Agreement by Holdco as the sole
stockholder of each of the Merger Subs, and the filing of the Certificates of
Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Mars, Holdco or the Merger Subs are
necessary to authorize the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the
valid and binding agreement of Galaxy, this Agreement constitutes the valid
and binding agreement of Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs, enforceable against
each of Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs in accordance with its terms, subject
to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

permit, action, filing or notification the failure of which to make or obtain
would not (A) have a Mars Material Adverse Effect or (B) prevent or
materially delay the consummation of the Mergers.



 

-31- (c) Assuming receipt of or compliance with the Mars Specified Approvals, and
receipt of the Mars Stockholder Approval, the execution, delivery and
performance by Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs of this Agreement and the
consummation by Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs of the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i) contravene or
conflict with the organizational or governing documents of Mars or any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) contravene or conflict with or constitute a violation of
any provision of any Law binding upon or applicable to Mars or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, or (iii) result

bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or agreement binding upon Mars or any of its
Subsidiaries or result in the creation of any Lien (other than Permitted
Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of Mars or any of its
Subsidiaries, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), any such
violation, conflict, default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, right,
loss or Lien that would not have a Mars Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

(a) Mars has filed or furnished all forms, documents and reports required to
be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof by it with the SEC since
January 1, 2005 (the " _Mars SEC Documents_ "), each of which, in each case as
of its date, or, if amended, as finally amended prior to the date of this
Agreement, complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as of the
date filed with the SEC, and none of the Mars SEC Documents contained any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of

material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of Mars and its
consolidated Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein, including the notes thereto) in conformity with GAAP

financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required in all

controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material  



 

-32-  information required to be disclosed by Mars in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC,
and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Mars management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302
and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Mars management has completed an
assessment of the effectiveness of Mars internal controls over financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2006, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. The assessment of the effectiveness of
Mars internal controls over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their
report which is included in the Mars SEC Documents.

obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since the Reference
Date and (d) for liabilities and obligations which have been discharged or

Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.7 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

(a) Each of Mars and its Subsidiaries is in compliance with and is not in
default under or in violation of any applicable Law, except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not have a Mars Material Adverse

Section 4.7(a) in respect of the matters referenced in Section 4.4

(b) Mars and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, grants,
authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,

necessary for Mars and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being
conducted (the " _Mars Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any such
Mars Permit would not have a Mars Material Adverse Effect. All Mars Permits
are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and
effect would not have a Mars Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement or as required by applicable
Law, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount

potentially responsible) for the remediation of any Materials of
Environmental Concern (as defined below) at, on or beneath its facilities or

Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

Section 4.24 _Financing_.

(a) Attached as Section 4.24(a) of the Mars Disclosure Schedule is a true,
accurate and complete copy of a fully executed debt commitment letter, related
term sheets and the exhibits attached thereto (collectively, the "
_Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof, certain lenders have committed to provide Holdco with
loans in the amounts described therein, the proceeds of which are to be used
to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby (the
" _Financing_ ").

(b) The Commitment Letter in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Holdco, Mars and, to Mars knowledge, the other parties
thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The Commitment Letter
is in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or
otherwise amended or modified in any respect. None of Mars, Holdco or the
Merger Subs is in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth therein
and no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or
both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a breach or failure to
satisfy a condition precedent set forth therein. Mars, Holdco and the Merger
Subs have paid any and all commitment or other fees required by the
Commitment Letter that are due as of the date hereof, and will pay, after the
date hereof, all such commitments and fees as they become due. There are no
side letters or other agreements, arrangements or understandings relating to
the Financing to which Mars, Holdco, the Merger Subs, or any of their
affiliates is a party. Subject to its terms and conditions, the Financing,
when funded in accordance with the Commitment Letter, shall together with
Mars funds on hand and Galaxys funds on hand provide Holdco with
acquisition financing on the Closing Date sufficient to pay the Aggregate Cash
Consideration and the Option and Stock-Based Consideration (and any fees and
expenses of or payable by Mars, Holdco, the Merger Subs or the
Surviving Corporations) and all of its obligations hereunder. None of Mars,
Holdco or the Merger Subs require any additional funding or financing to
satisfy its obligations hereunder. The obligations of the lenders or
purchasers under the Commitment Letter to make the Financing available to
Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs pursuant to the terms of the Commitment
Letter are not subject to any conditions other than those set forth in the
Commitment Letter. As of the date of this Agreement, Mars (i) is not aware of
any fact or occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties of
Mars, Holdco or the Merger Subs in the Commitment Letter inaccurate in any
material respect, (ii) has no reason to believe that it will be unable
to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition of the Closing to be
satisfied by it or its affiliates contained in the Commitment Letter and (iii)
has no reason to believe that any portion of the Financing required to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby will not be made available to
Mars, Holdco or the Merger Subs on the Closing Date.



 

-41- (c) In no event shall the receipt or availability of the Financing by Mars,
Holdco, the Merger Subs or any of their respective affiliates or any other
funds, financing or other transactions (other than those contemplated hereby)
be a condition to any of the obligations of Mars, Holdco, or the Merger Subs
hereunder.

Section 4.25 _Solvency_. As of the Effective Time, assuming satisfaction of
the conditions to Mars and Merger Subs obligations to consummate the
Mergers as set forth herein, or the waiver of such conditions, and after
giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the Financing, any Alternate Financing and the
payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and the Option and Stock-Based
Consideration and any other repayment or refinancing of debt that may be
contemplated in the Commitment Letter, and payment of all related fees and
expenses, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of the
Galaxy Surviving Corporation would exceed (i) the value of all "liabilities of
the Galaxy Surviving Corporation, including contingent and other liabilities,"
as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal Laws governing determinations of the solvency of debtors, and (ii) the
amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of the Galaxy
Surviving Corporation on its existing debts (including contingent
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b) the Galaxy
Surviving Corporation would not have an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the business in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following the Effective Time; and (c) the Galaxy Surviving Corporation
will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature.

Section 4.26 _Capitalization of Holdco and the Merger Subs_. The authorized
capital stock of Galaxy Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, all of which are validly issued and outstanding.
The authorized capital stock of Mars Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, all of which are validly issued
and outstanding. The authorized capital stock of Holdco consists of
250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 5,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per shares, none of which are
issued and outstanding as of the date hereof. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Holdco is, and immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be, owned by Mars, and all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of each Merger Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by
Holdco. Except as set forth in this Agreement, none of Holdco or the Merger
Subs has outstanding any option, warrant, right, or any other agreement
pursuant to which any person other than Mars may acquire any equity security
of any of Holdco or the Merger Subs. None of Holdco or the Merger Subs has
conducted any business prior to the date hereof and has, and prior to the
Effective Time will have, no assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature
other than those incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and
the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
Holdco and the Merger Subs have provided true and complete copies of their
respective certificates of incorporation and by-laws to Galaxy.

Section 4.27 _Certain Arrangements_. There are no contracts, agreements,
arrangements or understandings between Mars, Holdco or the Merger Subs, on
the one hand, and any member of Galaxys management or directors, on the other
hand, as of the date hereof that relate in any way to Galaxy or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Prior to the Board of Directors
of Galaxy approving this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions  



 

-42-  contemplated hereby for purposes of the applicable provisions of the DGCL,
neither Mars nor Merger Sub, alone or together with any other Person, was at
any time, or became, an "interested stockholder" thereunder or has taken any
action that would cause any anti-takeover statute under the DGCL to be
applicable to this Agreement, the Mergers, or any transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. 

Section 4.28 _Ownership of Galaxy Shares_. None of Mars, Holdco or the Merger
Subs nor any of their respective Subsidiaries beneficially owns, directly or
indirectly, any Galaxy Shares or other securities convertible into,
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Galaxy Common Stock (in each
case, other than any such Galaxy Shares or other securities held on behalf of
third parties or held in trust to fund Galaxy or Mars obligations). Except for
the Galaxy Voting and Support Agreement being executed and delivered
concurrently herewith, there are no voting trusts or other agreements,
arrangements or understandings to which any of Mars, Holdco, the Merger Subs
or any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the voting
of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest of Galaxy or any of
its Subsidiaries nor are there any agreements, arrangements or understandings
to which Mars, Holdco, the Merger Subs or any of their respective Subsidiaries
is a party with respect to the acquisition, divestiture, retention, purchase,
sale or tendering of the capital stock or other equity or voting interest of
Galaxy or any of its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.29 _Rights Plan_. Mars has no stockholder rights plan, stockholder
rights agreements or similar agreements with any of its stockholders.

Section 4.30 _Tax Qualification_. Neither Mars nor any of its Subsidiaries
has taken or agreed to take any action or knows of any fact that is reasonably
likely to prevent or impede the Mergers, taken together, from being treated as
a transaction described in Section 351 of the Code or the Mars Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

Section 4.31 _No Additional Representations_. Each of Mars, Holdco and the
Merger Subs acknowledges that neither Galaxy nor any person has made any
representation or warranty, express or implied, of any kind, including without
limitation any representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness
of any information regarding Galaxy furnished or made available to Mars,
Holdco, the Merger Subs and any of their respective Representatives, in each
case except as expressly set forth in Article III (as modified by the Galaxy
Disclosure Schedule and the Galaxy SEC Documents), and none of Galaxy, its
directors, officers, employees, agents or other representatives, or any other
person shall be subject to any liability to Mars, Holdco, the Merger Subs or
any other person resulting from Galaxys making available, or Mars, Holdcos,
or the Merger Subs use of, such information, including the confidential
information memorandum, management presentation and other
presentation materials delivered to Mars, as subsequently updated,
supplemented or amended, or any information, documents or material made
available to Mars, Holdco, or the Merger Subs in the due diligence materials
provided, including in the data room, other management presentations (formal
or informal) or in any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.2 _Access_.

(a) Mars and Galaxy shall afford to the officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors and
agents and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ")
reasonable access during normal business hours upon reasonable notice and as
coordinated through such partys General Counsel or Chief Financial Officer
throughout the period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the
Termination Date, to its properties, contracts, commitments, books and
records. In addition, Mars, Holdco and Galaxy shall (and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other party (i) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
or state securities laws and (ii) all other information concerning its
business, finances, operations, properties, assets and personnel as the
requesting party may reasonably request. The foregoing
notwithstanding, neither Mars nor Galaxy shall be required to afford such
access if it determines in good faith that such access would unreasonably
disrupt its operations or those of any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a
violation of any agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party,
or would cause a risk of a loss of privilege or trade secret protection to it
or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a violation of any applicable
Law, nor shall Mars, Galaxy or any of their respective Representatives be
permitted to perform any onsite procedure with respect to any property of the
other party or its Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no person
directly responsible for the marketing, pricing or sales of (A) any product,
service or technology offered for sale, license or distribution by Galaxy that
is primarily used for the same purpose as any product, service or technology
offered for sale, license or distribution by Mars, Holdco or the Merger Subs,
or (B) any product, service or technology offered for sale, license or
distribution by Mars, Holdco or the Merger Subs that is primarily used for the
same purpose as any product, service or technology offered for sale, license
or distribution by Galaxy, shall have access to any information concerning
the current or future prices for, information or projections relating to
future prices of, or contract offers related to such products.



 

-50- (b) Mars hereby agrees that all information provided to it or its
Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be "Evaluation Material,"
as such term is used in, and shall be treated in accordance with, the
confidentiality agreement, dated as of August 7, 2007, between Galaxy and
Mars (the " _Galaxy Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Galaxy hereby agrees that
all information provided to it or its Representatives in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall
be deemed to be "Evaluation Material," as such term is used in, and shall be
treated in accordance with, the confidentiality agreement, dated as of October
19, 2007, between Galaxy and Mars (the " _Mars Confidentiality Agreement_ "
and, together with the Galaxy Confidentiality Agreement, the "
_Confidentiality Agreements_ ").

Section 5.3 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Subject to Section 5.3(b), Galaxy agrees that neither it nor any
Subsidiary of Galaxy shall, and that it shall direct its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing
information) any inquiries, proposals or offers (including any proposal from
or offer to Galaxys stockholders) with respect to, or the making or
completion of, an Alternative Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or offer
(including any proposal from or offer to Galaxys stockholders) that is
reasonably likely to lead to an Alternative Proposal; (ii) engage, continue or
participate in any negotiations concerning, or provide or cause to be provided
any non-public information or data relating to Galaxy or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with, or have any discussions (other than to state
that they are not permitted to have discussions and to refer to this
Agreement) with any person relating to, or that is reasonably likely to lead
to, an Alternative Proposal; (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or propose
publicly to approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal; (iv)
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement
relating to any Alternative Proposal; or (v) resolve to propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing; _provided_ , _however_ , it is understood and agreed
that any determination or action by the Board of Directors of Galaxy
permitted under Section 5.3(b) or (c), or Section 7.1(h), shall not, in and of
itself, be deemed to be a breach or violation of this Section 5.3(a) or, in
the case of Section 5.3(b), give Mars a right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(j).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.3(a), at any time
prior to the Galaxy Stockholder Approval, Galaxy may, in response to an
unsolicited bona fide written Alternative Proposal received after the date
hereof (so long as such Alternative Proposal did not result from a breach by
Galaxy or any Representative of Section 5.3(a)), (i) contact the person or
group making such Alternative Proposal and its advisors solely for the purpose
of clarifying the proposal and any material terms thereof and the conditions
to consummation, so as to determine whether such Alternative Proposal is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and (ii) if the Board of
Directors of Galaxy determines, in good faith, after consultation with
its outside counsel and financial advisors, that such Alternative Proposal
constitutes or is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, Galaxy
may thereafter (A) furnish non-public information with respect to Galaxy and
its Subsidiaries to the person or group making such Alternative Proposal and
their Representatives and potential debt and equity financing sources pursuant
to a customary confidentiality agreement, and (B) participate in discussions
or  



 

-51-  negotiations with such person or group and their respective Representatives
regarding such Alternative Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that Galaxy
shall provide or make available to Mars (subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement) any material non-public information concerning Galaxy or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to the person making such Alternative Proposal
or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to
Mars.

(c) Except as set forth in Section 7.1(h) or (j) or this Section 5.3(c),
neither the Board of Directors of Galaxy nor any committee thereof shall (i)
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Mars, Holdco or the Merger Subs, or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Mars, Holdco or
the Merger Subs, the Galaxy Recommendation; (ii) approve or recommend any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or similar agreement constituting or relating to, or that
is intended to be or would reasonably be likely to result in, any Alternative
Proposal; or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve,
endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if, prior to receipt of the Galaxy Stockholder Approval, the Board of
Directors of Galaxy determines in good faith that an unsolicited bona fide
written Alternative Proposal received by Galaxy constitutes a Superior
Proposal (after complying with, and giving effect to any irrevocable and
unconditional commitments made by Mars pursuant to Section 7.1(h)) or that the
exercise of its fiduciary duties so require, the Board of Directors of Galaxy
or any committee thereof may withdraw, modify or qualify its Galaxy
Recommendation (a " _Change of Galaxy Recommendation_ ").

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Galaxy or its Board of
Directors from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a
"stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of
Directors of Galaxy determines in good faith, after consultation with Galaxys
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors of Galaxy
to make such disclosure would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations to Galaxys stockholders
under applicable Law.

(e) Galaxy promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise Mars
orally and in writing of (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers
reasonably expected to lead to an Alternative Proposal, (ii) any request for
information relating to Galaxy or its Subsidiaries reasonably expected to be
related to an Alternative Proposal and (iii) any inquiry or request for
discussion or negotiation that would reasonably be expected to result in an
Alternative Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making
any such Alternative Proposal, indication, inquiry, offer or request and the
material terms and conditions of any such Alternative Proposal, indication,
inquiry or offer. Galaxy shall keep Mars reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status (including any material changes to the terms
thereof) of any such discussions or negotiations regarding any such
Alternative Proposal, indication, inquiry or offer or any material
developments relating thereto (Galaxy agreeing that it shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with
any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits Galaxy
from providing such information to Mars but it being agreed that the third
parties financing sources may impose confidentiality restrictions on Galaxy
with respect to their proposed financing).



 

-52- (f) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide proposal or offer made by any person for (i) a merger, reorganization,
share exchange, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or similar transaction involving Galaxy, (ii) the
acquisition by any person of twenty percent (20%) or more of the consolidated
total assets (based on fair market value) of Galaxy and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, or (iii) the acquisition by any person of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the outstanding shares of Galaxy Common Stock.

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean an
Alternative Proposal that the Board of Directors of Galaxy determines in good
faith, after consultation with Galaxys financial and legal advisors, and
considering such factors as Galaxys Board of Directors considers to be
appropriate, to be more favorable to Galaxy and its stockholders than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that for purposes of
the definition of "Superior Proposal", the references to "20%" in the
definition of Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "50%."

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, each of Galaxy and Mars shall cooperate in preparing and causing to
be filed with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and Galaxy, Mars
and Holdco shall cooperate in preparing and Holdco shall cause to be filed
with the SEC the Registration Statement. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
will be included in the Registration Statement as a prospectus and will
constitute a part of the Registration Statement. Each of Galaxy, Mars and
Holdco shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of the
SEC, to have the Registration Statement declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing and to cause the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus in definitive form to be mailed to Galaxys
and Mars respective stockholders as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of
Galaxy, Mars and Holdco will notify the other party, as promptly as
practicable after the receipt thereof, of any written comments, and advise
each other of any oral comments, from the SEC or its staff and of any request
by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or
supplements to the Filings or for additional information, and will supply the
other party with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other
government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Filings, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the shares of Holdco Common
Stock issuable in the Mergers. Galaxy, Mars and Holdco shall cooperate and
provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Filings prior to filing such with the SEC, and
each will provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with the
SEC. No Filings or amendment or supplement to the Filings will be made by
Galaxy, Mars or Holdco without the prior approval of the other party (not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as required by Law and then only
to the extent necessary, or without providing the other party the opportunity
to review and comment thereon; provided, however, that Galaxy, in connection
with a Change of Galaxy Recommendation, may amend or supplement the Filings
(including by incorporation by reference) to effect such a Change of Galaxy
Recommendation and Mars, in connection with a Change of Mars Recommendation,
may amend or supplement the Filings (including by incorporation by reference)
to effect such a Change of Mars Recommendation.  



 

-53-  Holdco shall advise Galaxy promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the
time when the Registration Statement has been declared effective, the
issuance of any stop order, or the suspension of the qualification of Holdco
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Mergers for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction. If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information
relating to the parties hereto, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors should be discovered by the parties hereto which should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Filings so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or an event
occurs which is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Filings, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the
other party and an amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
law, disseminated to Galaxys stockholders and/or Mars stockholders, as
applicable.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, the parties
shall prepare and file any other filings required under the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act or any other federal or state securities Law relating to the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including without
limitation Section 7.1, as soon as is reasonably practicable following the
date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective with the SEC (i)
Galaxy shall, regardless of any Change of Galaxy Recommendation, take all
action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate
of incorporation and by-laws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the purpose of
obtaining the Galaxy Stockholder Approval (the " _Galaxy Meeting_ "), and
(ii) subject to a Change of Galaxy Recommendation in accordance with Section
5.3(c), the Board of Directors of Galaxy shall make the Galaxy Recommendation
and Galaxy shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) or (c), if on a date for which the Galaxy
Meeting is scheduled (the " _Galaxy Meeting Original Date_ "), Galaxy has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Galaxy Common
Stock to adopt this Agreement, whether or not a quorum is present, Galaxy
shall have the right to postpone or adjourn the Galaxy Meeting to a date which
shall not be more than 45 days after the Galaxy Meeting Original Date. If
Galaxy continues not to receive proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of Galaxy Common Stock to approve the Galaxy Merger, whether or not a
quorum is present, Galaxy may make one or more successive postponements
or adjournments of Galaxy Meeting as long as the date of the Galaxy Meeting
is not postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of 45 days from the
Galaxy Meeting Original Date in reliance on this subsection. In the event that
the Galaxy Meeting is adjourned or postponed as a result of applicable Law,
including the need to supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, any
days resulting from such adjournment or postponement shall not be included for
purposes of the calculations of numbers of days pursuant to this Section 5.4.



 

-54- (e) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including without
limitation Section 7.1, (i) Mars shall as soon as is reasonably practicable
following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes effective
with the SEC, regardless of any Change of Mars Recommendation, take all action
necessary in accordance with the DGCL and its certificate of incorporation
and by-laws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus for the purpose of obtaining the Mars
Stockholder Approval (the " _Mars Meeting_ "), and (ii) subject to a Change of
Mars Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.4(f), the Board of Directors
of Mars shall make the Mars Recommendation and Mars shall use reasonable
efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval of
the issuance of Holdco Common Stock contemplated hereby.

(f) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4(f), neither the Board of Directors
of Mars nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to Galaxy or its shareholders, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse to Galaxy or its Shareholders, the Mars Recommendation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to receipt of the Mars Stockholder
Approval, the Board of Directors of Mars determines in good faith that
the exercise of its fiduciary duties so require, the Board of Directors of
Mars or any committee thereof may withdraw, modify or qualify its Mars
Recommendation (a " _Change of Mars Recommendation_ ").

(g) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(a) or (e), if on a date for which the Mars
Meeting is scheduled (the " _Mars Meeting Original Date_ "), Mars has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Mars Common
Stock to approve the issuance of Holdco Common Stock as contemplated by this
Agreement, whether or not a quorum is present, Mars shall have the right to
postpone or adjourn the Mars Meeting to a date which shall not be more than
45 days after the Mars Meeting Original Date. If Mars continues not to receive
proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Mars Common Stock to
approve such issuance of Holdco Common Stock, whether or not a quorum is
present, Mars may make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of
the Mars Meeting as long as the date of the Mars Meeting is not postponed or
adjourned more than an aggregate of 45 days from the Mars Meeting Original
Date in reliance on this subsection. In the event that the Mars Meeting is
adjourned or postponed as a result of applicable Law, including the need to
supplement the Filings, any days resulting from such adjournment
or postponement shall not be included for purposes of the calculations of
numbers of days pursuant to this Section 5.4.

Section 5.5  _Employee Matters_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, except as expressly set forth herein,
Galaxy shall, and Holdco shall cause Galaxy to, honor all Galaxy Benefit
Plans and Galaxy Foreign Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time, _provided_ that nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the amendment
or termination of any such Galaxy Benefit Plans, Galaxy Foreign Plans,
arrangements and agreements in accordance with their terms and applicable Law,
subject to the following sentence; _provided_ , _further_ , that nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit Holdco from merging Galaxys 401(k) plan with
the Mars 401(k) plan at any time after the Effective Time so long as such
merger does not diminish the benefits provided to Galaxy Employees (as
defined  



 

-55-  below). For a period of twelve (12) months following the Effective Time,
Holdco shall provide, or shall cause to be provided, to each current
employee of Galaxy or its Subsidiaries and former employee of Galaxy and its
Subsidiaries terminated by, or pursuant to an agreement with, Galaxy or its
Subsidiaries (a list of which former employees is set forth on Section 5.5(a)
of the Galaxy Disclosure Schedule) (" _Galaxy Employees_ ") compensation and
benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than the compensation
and benefits provided to Galaxy Employees immediately before the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) Holdco shall or shall cause the Galaxy Surviving Corporation to provide
Galaxy Employees whose employment terminates during the one-year period
following the Effective Time with severance benefits in accordance with
Galaxys Change in Control Severance Policy, and (ii) during such one-year
period following the Effective Time, severance benefits offered to Galaxy
Employees shall be determined without taking into account any reduction after
the Effective Time in compensation paid to Galaxy Employees. Notwithstanding
any term in this Section 5.5(a) to the contrary, nothing in this Section
5.5(a) shall be deemed to restrict the ability to hire or terminate the
employment of any current or former Galaxy employees following the Effective
Time.

(b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Mars,
Holdco and their respective Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Galaxy
Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Galaxy
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with Galaxy and
its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time,
to the same extent as such Galaxy Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Galaxy employee benefit
plan in which such Galaxy Employee participated or was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time or if there was no such credit for
such service under a similar Galaxy employee benefit plan, under Galaxys
401(k) plan, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to
benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that
its application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the
same period of time. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Galaxy Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans, and (ii) for
purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or
vision benefits to any Galaxy Employee, Mars and Holdco shall cause all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New
Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless
such conditions would not have been waived under the comparable plans of
Galaxy or its Subsidiaries in which such employee participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and Mars and Holdco shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Galaxy Benefit Plan in which such Galaxy
Employee participated immediately before the consummation of the Mergers
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Galaxy may pay each Galaxy Employee employed as of immediately prior to
December 31, 2007 and then participating in any Galaxy Benefit Plan that is
an annual bonus plan (a " _Bonus Plan_ "), and any former Galaxy Employee
terminated by, or pursuant to an  



 

-56-  agreement with, Galaxy or its Subsidiaries, that remains eligible to
participate in any such Bonus Plan to the extent permitted by the terms of the
relevant Bonus Plan (a list of which former employees is set forth on Section
5.5(c) of the Galaxy Disclosure Schedule), at the times set forth in, and in a
manner consistent with, the relevant Bonus Plan, the Galaxy Employees full-
year bonus entitlement under all such Bonus Plans for 2007, based on Galaxys
actual performance; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the aggregate
liability restrictions set forth in the last sentence of this Section 5.5(c),
the Galaxy Board of Directors may, in its reasonable discretion, pay
additional bonuses under the Bonus Plan for calendar year 2007 to certain
Galaxy employees for performance award or retention purposes in a manner that
is inconsistent with the Bonus Plan as adopted by the Galaxy Board of
Directors prior to the date hereof. In addition, prior to the Effective Time,
Galaxy may make bonus payments in respect of the year ended December 31, 2007
pursuant to the "Additional Bonus Pool" under the TV Guide Annual Bonus Plan.
Bonus payments hereunder shall be calculated without taking into account any
expenses or costs associated with or arising as a result of transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any non-recurring charges that would not
reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement not occurred. The aggregate liability for payment under the
Bonus Plan for calendar year 2007 (including, for avoidance of doubt, any
payment made for performance award or retention purposes in a manner that is
inconsistent with the Bonus Plan as adopted by the Galaxy Board of Directors
prior to the date hereof) shall not exceed $24,000,000.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, (i) Galaxy may adopt a Bonus Plan for 2008
consistent with the terms and provisions of the Bonus Plan for 2007,
but giving effect to ordinary course annual increases which are consistent
with Section 5.1(b)(iv) hereof, (ii) such Bonus Plan for 2008 shall be
rationally related to Galaxys business plan for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2008, (iii) such Bonus Plan for 2008 shall be based upon, and
consistent with, the continued operation of the business and (iv) individual
bonus payments under the Bonus Plan for 2008 shall be allocated in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice; _provided_ that
prior to adoption of such Bonus Plan for 2008, Galaxy shall consult with Mars
and give Mars an opportunity to review and comment upon any such proposed
Bonus Plan and agrees to consider any comments made by Mars with respect
thereto in good faith. Bonus payments hereunder shall be calculated without
taking into account any expenses or costs associated with or arising as a
result of transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any non-recurring
charges that would not reasonably be expected to have been incurred had the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred. No participant in
the Bonus Plan for 2008 shall be entitled to, and Galaxy shall not pay,
any pro-rated bonus amount under such 2008 Bonus Plan, and no acceleration of
the right to payment of any such 2008 bonus shall occur, if such participants
employment with Galaxy terminates prior to the required date of payment for
such 2008 bonus under such 2008 Bonus Plan. The target aggregate annual bonus
pool for calendar year 2008 shall be $24,000,000.

(e) Mars and Holdco hereby acknowledge that a "change of control" (or similar
phrase) within the meaning of the Galaxy Stock Plans (and award agreements
thereunder) and the Galaxy Benefit Plans and the Galaxy Foreign Plans, as
applicable, including without limitation the employee change of control
agreements, retention arrangements, employment agreements, the Change in
Control Severance Policy and the letters to Galaxy Employees regarding a
transaction bonus will occur at or prior to the Effective Time, as
applicable, and from and after the Effective Time, the Galaxy Surviving
Corporation shall, and Holdco shall cause the Galaxy Surviving Corporation to,
honor the terms of all such agreements, arrangements, plans, policies and
letters.

action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) obtaining all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iii) defending
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers and the other

in no event shall Galaxy or any of its Subsidiaries, or Mars or any of its
Subsidiaries or Holdco be required to pay prior to the Effective Time any fee,
penalty or other consideration to any third party for any consent or approval
required for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under any contract or agreement.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the parties hereto shall (i) promptly, but in no event later
than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof (or such later date as
may be mutually agreed in writing by the parties hereto), file any and all
required Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with respect to the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and use
reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act; (ii) use (and, in the case of
Mars, Holdco or the Merger Subs, cause each of their respective affiliates to
use) reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other in (x) determining
whether any filings are required to be made with, or consents, permits,
authorizations, waivers, clearances, approvals, and expirations or
terminations of waiting periods are required to be obtained from, any
third parties or other Governmental Entities in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (y) timely making all such filings and timely

to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby,
including taking (and, in the case of Mars, Holdco or the Merger Subs, cause
each of their respective affiliates to take) all such further action as may be
necessary promptly to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice,  



 

-58-  state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any
other nation or other jurisdiction or any other person may assert under any
Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Mergers so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the End
Date), including, without limitation, (x) proposing, negotiating, committing
to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the
sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or businesses of Mars, Holdco
or their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, or of Galaxy or its
Subsidiaries and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take any actions that
after the Closing Date would limit the freedom of Holdco or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporations) or affiliates freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Corporations) businesses, product lines or assets,
in each case as may be required in order to avoid commencement of litigation
seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction,
temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing, materially delaying
the Closing or delaying the Closing beyond the End Date; provided that neither
Galaxy nor any of its Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or consent
or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement,
condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental Authority to
sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict,
operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of Galaxy or any
of its Subsidiaries, unless such requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or order is binding on Galaxy only in the event that the Closing
occurs; _provided_ that none of Mars, Holdco or the Merger Subs shall be
required to take any of the actions described in clauses (iv)(x) or (y) above
with respect to any of their or Galaxys assets or businesses if such action
would be material in relation to the assets or business of Holdco, Mars,
Galaxy and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, at or after the
Effective Time.

(c) Subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, Galaxy and Mars shall keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
thereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by Galaxy or Mars, as the case may be, or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect to such transactions. Galaxy and Mars shall
permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection
with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental Entity. Each of
Galaxy and Mars agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 5.6, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Law, each of Galaxy and Mars shall cooperate in
all respects with each other and shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or  



 

-59-  overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.7 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby after the date
hereof, each of Galaxy and Mars and the members of their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize
the effects of such statute or regulation on the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing in this Section 5.7 shall be
construed to permit a party to this Agreement to do any act that would
otherwise constitute a violation or breach of, or as a waiver of any of the
rights of another party under, any other provision of this Agreement.

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. Subject to Section 5.4(a) of this
Agreement and except in connection with a Change of Galaxy Recommendation or a
Change of Mars Recommendation, Galaxy and Mars will consult with and provide
each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press release or
other public statement, comment or filing and will obtain the approval of the
other, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,
prior to the issuance of such press release or other public statement or
comment or the making of any filing relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated herein and shall not issue any such press release or
other public statement or comment, or make any such filing, prior to such
consultation and approval except as may be required by applicable Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, in which case the parties will use their reasonable best efforts to
consult with the other party in advance of any such press release or other
public statement, comment or filing. The executive officers of Mars and Galaxy
will direct their respective employees, Representatives and subsidiaries to
comply with this Section 5.8. Mars and Galaxy agree to issue a joint press
release announcing this Agreement.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses now existing in favor of
the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be,
of Galaxy or its Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents or in any agreement
with Galaxy or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Mergers and shall
continue in full force and effect. For a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time, Holdco and the Galaxy Surviving Corporation shall maintain in
effect the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions of Galaxys and any Galaxy Subsidiarys certificates of
incorporation and by-laws or similar organization documents as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements
of Galaxy or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective directors, officers
or employees as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall
not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner
that  



 

-60-  would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the
Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or employees of
Galaxy or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights
to indemnification in respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim
made within such period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or
resolution of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Holdco shall
assume, be jointly and severally liable for, and honor, guaranty and stand
surety for, and shall cause the Galaxy Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their respective terms, each of the
covenants contained in this Section 5.9 without limit as to time; provided
that in no event shall such action by Holdco have the effect of increasing or
otherwise broadening the scope of the indemnification obligations of the
Galaxy Surviving Corporation to such persons as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, each of Holdco and the Galaxy
Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing, following receipt of any undertakings required by applicable Law),
to the same extent that such persons are entitled to indemnification pursuant
to the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of Galaxy as in effect as of
the date hereof, each current and former director, officer or employee of
Galaxy or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director,
officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at
the request or for the benefit of Galaxy (each, together with such persons
heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any
costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and expenses
in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law
and following receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection
with any action or omission occurring or alleged to have occurred in such
Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer or employee of Galaxy or
any of its Subsidiaries or in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at the request or for the benefit of Galaxy, before the Effective
Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such persons serving as
an officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at
the request or for the benefit of Galaxy). In the event of any such Action,
Holdco and the Galaxy Surviving Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with
the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such Action.

(c) Galaxy shall obtain prior to the Effective Time fully-paid six-year
"tail" insurance policies (the " _D andO Tail_") with respect to directors and
officers liability insurance of the type and with the amount of coverage no
less favorable than those of the directors and officers liability insurance
maintained as of the date hereof by Galaxy and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Current Policies_ "), and with such other terms as are no less favorable in
the aggregate than those in the Current Policies; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such DandO Tail is not available at a cost not greater than 300% of the
last annual premium paid by Galaxy prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto (which current annual
premium amount is set forth in Section 5.9(c) of the Galaxy Disclosure
Schedule), Galaxy shall purchase  



 

-61-  as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. Holdco shall
cause the Galaxy Surviving Corporation to maintain the DandO Tail in full
force and effect, for its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to
be honored by the Galaxy Surviving Corporation, and no party shall have any
further obligation to purchase or pay for such insurance pursuant to this
Section 5.9(c). 

(d) Holdco shall, or shall cause the Galaxy Surviving Corporation to, pay all
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in
this Section 5.9.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to,
and not in limitation of, any other rights such person may have under the
certificates of incorporation or by-laws or other organization documents of
Galaxy or any of its Subsidiaries or the Galaxy Surviving Corporation, any
other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise. The provisions of
this Section 5.9 shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and expressly
are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of the Indemnified
Parties.

(f) In the event Holdco, the Galaxy Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Holdco or the Galaxy Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume
the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

Section 5.10 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Mars or Galaxy, directly or indirectly, the right to control or
direct the other partys operations prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Mars and Galaxy shall exercise, consistent with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over
their respective operations.

Section 5.11 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Galaxy shall give prompt
notice to Mars, and Mars shall give prompt notice to Galaxy, of (i) any notice
or other communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby
or from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be
required in connection with the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated
hereby, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of such
party to obtain such consent could be material to Galaxy, the Surviving
Corporations, or Mars (or, following the Effective Time, Holdco); (ii) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such
partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Mergers or
the other transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of the
conditions to the Mergers set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or
satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any
provision of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.11 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this  



 

-62-  Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to the party receiving such
notice; and, _provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to give prompt notice
hereunder pursuant to clause (iii) shall not constitute a failure of a
condition to the Mergers set forth in Article VI except to the extent that the
underlying fact or circumstance not so notified would standing alone
constitute such a failure.

Section 5.12 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, Galaxy will take such
steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable hereto to cause
dispositions of Galaxy equity securities (including derivative securities)
pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual
who is a director or officer of Galaxy to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.13 _Obligations of Holdco, the Merger Subs, and the Surviving
Corporations_. Mars shall take all action necessary to cause Holdco, the
Merger Subs and the Surviving Corporations to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and the Commitment Letter.

Section 5.14 _Agreement to Defend; Stockholder Litigation_. In the event any
claim, action, suit, investigation or other legal or administrative
proceeding by any Governmental Entity or other Person is commenced that
questions the validity or legality of the Mergers or seeks damages in
connection therewith, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and use their
reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto; _provided_ ,
that nothing in this Section 5.14 shall limit the parties obligations under
Section 5.6 hereof. Galaxy shall give Mars a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against Galaxy and its directors relating to the Mergers; _provided_ , that no
such settlement shall be agreed to without Mars consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

Section 5.15 _Nasdaq Listing_. Mars and Holdco shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Holdco Common Stock to be issued as part of
the Merger Consideration to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq Global
Select Market.

Section 5.16 _Board of Directors_. As required by Section 251(g), effective as
of immediately after the Effective Time, the directors of Holdco shall be the
directors of Mars immediately prior to the Effective Time. Immediately
following the Effective Time, Holdco shall take all such necessary action so
as to obtain the resignations of such Holdco directors, and cause the
appointment of such new Holdco directors, as may be necessary to provide that
four (4) individuals designated by Mars and three (3) individuals designated
by Galaxy and acceptable to Mars shall be appointed to, and shall comprise,
the Board of Directors of Holdco.

Section 5.17 _Financing_.

(a) Mars and Holdco shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and consummate, at or prior to the Closing, the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain rating agency approvals;
(ii) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions to
obtaining the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter; (iii)
negotiate definitive agreements with  



 

-63-  respect to the Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the
Commitment Letter (or, at Mars election, on terms that would not adversely
impact the ability of Mars, Holdco and the Merger Subs to timely consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby); (iv) if necessary, borrowing pursuant
to the Commitment Letter in the event any "flex" provisions are exercised; and
(v) seek to enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter. Mars will furnish
correct and complete copies of all such definitive agreements to Galaxy
promptly upon their execution.

(b) Mars shall keep Galaxy informed on a current basis in reasonable detail
with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the
Financing, including the status of Mars and Holdcos efforts to comply with
the terms of, and satisfy the conditions contemplated by, the Commitment
Letter, and shall give Galaxy prompt notice of any material adverse change
with respect to the Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Mars agrees to
notify Galaxy promptly, and in any event within two Business Days, if at any
time (i) the Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason,
(ii) any financing source that is a party to the Commitment Letter notifies
Mars that such source no longer intends to provide financing to Holdco on the
terms set forth therein, or (iii) for any reason Mars no longer believes in
good faith that Holdco will be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms described
therein. Mars shall not, and shall not permit any of its affiliates to,
without the prior written consent of Galaxy, take or fail to take any action
or enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint
venture, disposition, lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that could
reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent consummation of
the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter or any Alternate
Financing contemplated by any New Commitment Letter. Neither Mars nor Holdco
shall, without the prior written consent of Galaxy, amend or alter, or agree
to amend or alter, the Commitment Letter in any manner that would (i) expand
or adversely amend the conditions to the financing set forth in the Commitment
Letter; (ii) reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay
the Closing; (iii) reduce the aggregate amount of financing set forth in the
Commitment Letter; (iv) adversely impact the ability of Mars, Holdco or the
Merger Subs to enforce their rights against the other parties to the
Commitment Letter; or (v) adversely affect the interests of Galaxy and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole (it being the understanding of the parties that
neither Galaxy nor its Subsidiaries are intended to be third-party
beneficiaries of the Commitment Letter).

(c) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter or the Commitment Letter
shall be terminated or modified in a manner materially adverse to Mars or
Holdco for any reason, Mars and Holdco shall use their reasonable best efforts
to arrange to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an
amount sufficient to consummate the Mergers and other transactions
contemplated hereby (" _Alternate Financing_ ") and to obtain, and, if
obtained, will provide Galaxy with a copy of, a new financing commitment that
provides for at least the same amount of financing as the Commitment Letter
as originally issued, and on terms and conditions (including termination
rights and funding conditions) no less favorable to Mars, Holdco or the Merger
Subs than those included in the Commitment Letter (the " _New Commitment
Letter_ "). In the event Alternate Financing is obtained and a New Commitment
Letter is entered into, references in this Agreement to the Commitment Letter
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the references in this Section 5.17)
shall be deemed to include any New Commitment Letter, as applicable.



 

-64- (d) Galaxy agrees to provide Mars and Holdco with such cooperation in
connection with the arrangement of the financings contemplated by the
Commitment Letter (including any New Commitment Letter) as may be reasonably
requested by Mars, including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions,
due diligence sessions, management presentation sessions, "road shows" and
sessions with rating agencies, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to prepare
business projections and financial statements (including pro forma financial
statements), (iii) assisting Mars in preparing offering memoranda, private
placement memoranda and similar documents, (iv) using reasonable best efforts
to obtain surveys and title insurance as may be reasonably requested by Mars,
(v) reasonably facilitating the pledge of collateral and (vi) using
reasonable best efforts to obtain consents to the collateral assignment, to be
effective as of the Effective Time, of the real and personal property of
Galaxy and its Subsidiaries in connection with the financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter or any New Commitment Letter. Galaxy shall also use
reasonable best efforts to cause legal counsel to provide customary legal
opinions and an independent auditor of Galaxy to provide any unqualified
opinions, consents or customary comfort letters with respect to its financial
statements. Galaxy shall allow Mars representatives the opportunity to review
and comment upon any such financial statements (including pro forma financial
statements) in draft form and to allow such representatives access to Galaxy
and supporting documentation with respect to the preparation of such financial
statements and the independent auditors work papers relating to such
financial statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) such requested
cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of
Galaxy and its Subsidiaries and (ii) neither Galaxy nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or
incur any other liability in connection with the financings contemplated by
the Commitment Letter (including any New Commitment Letter) prior to the
Effective Time (unless such fee or liability is subject to the immediately
succeeding sentence or such commitment fee or liability is conditional on the
occurrence of the Effective Time). Mars shall, promptly upon request by
Galaxy, reimburse Galaxy for all out-of-pocket costs and fees and expenses of
counsel incurred by Galaxy or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such
cooperation to the extent such actions shall have been requested by Mars, and,
except in cases involving fraud or intentional misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation on the part of Galaxy and its Subsidiaries, officers,
directors, employees, agents and affiliates, Mars (or, after the Effective
Time, Holdco) shall indemnify and hold harmless Galaxy and its Subsidiaries,
officers, directors, employees, agents and affiliates against any costs or

ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION

Section 7.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Anything contained in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after any
approval by the stockholders of Galaxy of the matters presented in connection
with the Mergers:

(a) by the mutual written consent of Galaxy and Mars;



 

-68- (b) by either Galaxy or Mars, if (i) the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before June 6, 2008 (the " _End Date_ "), _provided_ , that if
by the End Date any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(c)-(e) shall
not have been satisfied but all other conditions shall be satisfied (other

Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall not have breached in any
material respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that
shall have proximately caused the failure to consummate the Merger on or
before such date; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the
Effective Time shall not have occurred on or before the End Date as a result
of the failure of one or more of the persons obligated to provide a portion of
the Financing (or Alternate Financing) to provide its respective portion of
such financing and Mars shall not have breached its obligations under this
Agreement other than its obligations to consummate the closing in accordance
with Section 1.2 (a " _Financing Failure_ "), then subject to clause (i)
above, Mars may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b); 

(c) by either Galaxy or Mars, if any Restraint permanently enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Mergers has become final and
non-appealable, _provided_ that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(c) shall have used such efforts as may be
required by Section 5.6 to prevent, oppose and remove such Restraint; 

(d) by either Galaxy or Mars, if the Galaxy Meeting (including any
adjournments or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Galaxy
Stockholder Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been
obtained;

(e) by either Galaxy or Mars, if the Mars Meeting (including any adjournments
or postponements thereof) shall have concluded and the Mars Stockholder
Approval contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been obtained;

(f) by Galaxy, if Mars shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
(i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2
or failure of the Closing to occur and (ii) cannot be cured by the End Date,
_provided_ that Galaxy shall have given Mars written notice, delivered at
least fifteen (15) days prior to such termination, stating Galaxys intention

such termination (and such matter shall not have been cured);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Galaxy shall not have a right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.1(f) if it is then in breach of any
representations, warranties covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement that would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section
6.1 or 6.3; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that if at the time of any
purported termination of this Agreement by Galaxy pursuant to this Section
7.1(f) due solely to a Financing Failure, Galaxy would also have had the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(i), then Galaxy
shall be deemed to have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(i);



 

-69- (g) by Mars, if Galaxy shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i)
would result in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.3 and
(ii) cannot be cured by the End Date, _provided_ that Mars shall have given
Galaxy written notice, delivered at least fifteen (15) days prior to such
termination, stating Mars intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.1(g) and the basis for such termination (and such matter shall
not have been cured); _provided_ , _however_ , that Mars shall not have a
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g) if it is
then in breach of any representations, warranties covenants or other
agreements contained in this Agreement that would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 6.1 or 6.2;

(h) by Galaxy, prior to the receipt of the Galaxy Stockholder Approval, if (i)
the Board of Directors of Galaxy has determined that it has received a
Superior Proposal; (ii) Galaxy has notified Mars in writing of its intention
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(h), and included with
such notice the identity of the person making a Superior Proposal and a
summary of the material terms of such proposal; (iii) Galaxy has offered to
negotiate with Mars in good faith during the 48-hour period immediately
following receipt by Mars of the notice referred to in clause (ii) above (to
the extent Mars desires to negotiate) regarding adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement; _provided_ that any material change in the
economic terms or closing conditions of such proposal shall extend such period
by 24 hours from the time of receipt by Mars of notice of such change (if
later than the time that such period would otherwise have ended); (iv)
following such period referred to in clause (iii) above, and taking into
account any revised proposal irrevocably and unconditionally committed to by
Mars during such period, the Board of Directors or a committee thereof shall
have determined in good faith and after consultation with its outside counsel
and financial advisors that there is a Superior Proposal more favorable to the
stockholders of Galaxy than the proposal committed to by Mars; (v)
concurrently with such termination, Galaxy enters into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal; and (vi) prior to or concurrently with
such termination, Galaxy pays the Galaxy Termination Fee or, if such
termination occurs other than during business hours on a Business Day, Galaxy
provides to Mars a copy of irrevocable instructions to pay such amount no
later than 9:00 a.m New York City time on the next succeeding Business Day; 

(i) by Galaxy, if (i) the Mergers shall not have been consummated by the close
of business (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the first
date upon which all conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.3 (other
than Section 6.3(c)) are satisfied and (ii) at the time of such termination
such conditions continue to be satisfied or any failure of such conditions to
be satisfied is attributable to the fault of Mars, Holdco, or the Merger Subs;

(j) by Mars, if the Board of Directors of Galaxy or any committee thereof
makes any Change of Galaxy Recommendation adverse to Mars, Holdco or the
Merger Subs, or approves, endorses or recommends, or publicly proposes to
approve, endorse or recommend, any Alternative Proposal (it being understood
that the taking by Galaxy or any of its Representatives of any of the actions
permitted by Section 5.3(b) shall not give rise to a right of termination
pursuant to this Section 7.1(j)), in each case within 10 Business Days
following such Change of Galaxy Recommendation, approval, endorsement,
recommendation or proposal; and



 

-70- (k) by Galaxy, if the Board of Directors of Mars or any committee thereof
makes any Change of Mars Recommendation adverse to Galaxy or its
shareholders, in each case within 10 Business Days following such Change of
Mars Recommendation.

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become null
and void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of
the parties hereto or their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, except
that the provisions of Section 5.2(b), Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article
VIII will survive the termination hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
such termination shall relieve any party from liability for damages for any
fraud or willful or intentional breach of any provision of this Agreement (a "
_Fault Breach_ "). For avoidance of doubt, the failure of Mars to consummate
the Mergers in accordance with Section 1.2 due solely to a Financing Failure,
without any other willful or intentional breach of any of its obligations
under this Agreement, shall not be deemed to be a Fault Breach hereunder.

Section 7.3 _Expenses and Other Payments_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by Mars or Galaxy pursuant to Section
7.1(d), then Galaxy shall pay to Mars a fee of $27,700,000 in cash (the "

of immediately available funds, in the case of a termination by Mars, by the
end of the second Business Day following such termination, and in the case of
a termination by Galaxy, concurrently with the termination of this Agreement
(or, in the event such termination does not occur during a Business Day when
banks are open for business, by delivering a copy of irrevocable instructions
providing for the payment of the Galaxy Initial Termination Fee promptly upon
the opening of business on the next Business Day).

(b) If (i) (A) after the date of this Agreement, any Alternative Proposal
(substituting 50% for the 20% threshold set forth in the definition of
"Alternative Proposal") (a " _Qualifying Transaction_ ") is publicly proposed
or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the time of, the Galaxy
Meeting, (B) this Agreement is terminated by Mars or Galaxy pursuant to
Section 7.1(d) and (C) concurrently with or within six (6) months after such
termination, Galaxy shall have entered into a definitive agreement providing
for or consummates a Qualifying Transaction; (ii) Galaxy shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(h); or (iii) Mars shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(j), then in any such event

Termination Fee_ "), less the amount, if any, of the Galaxy Initial
Termination Fee previously paid, such payment to be made, in the case of a
termination referenced in clause (i) above, upon consummation of the
Qualifying Transaction, in the case of clause (ii) above, concurrently with
the termination of this Agreement (or, in the event such termination does not
occur during a Business Day when banks are open for business, by delivering a
copy of irrevocable instructions providing for the payment of the Galaxy
Termination Fee promptly upon the opening of business on the next Business
Day), or in the case of clause (iii) above, by the end of the second Business
Day following the termination of this Agreement,

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Mars or Galaxy pursuant to Section
7.1(e), then Mars shall pay to Galaxy a fee of $27,700,000 in cash (the "
_Mars Initial Termination_  



 

-71-   _Fee_ "), such payment to be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, in the case of a termination by Galaxy, by the end of the
second Business Day following such termination, and in the case of a
termination by Mars, concurrently with the termination of this Agreement (or,
in the event such termination does not occur during a Business Day when banks
are open for business, by delivering a copy of irrevocable instructions
providing for the payment of the Mars Termination Fee promptly upon the
opening of business on the next Business Day).

(d) If (i) this Agreement shall have been terminated by either Galaxy or Mars
pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and, for purposes of this clause (i), at the time
of such termination the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 and Sections
6.3(a) and 6.3(b) shall have been satisfied; (ii) (A) after the date of this
Agreement, any Qualifying Transaction (substituting, for purposes of this
Section 7.3(d) only, "Mars" for "Galaxy" in the definitions of "Qualifying
Transaction" and "Alternative Proposal") is publicly proposed or publicly
disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at the time of, the Mars Meeting, (B)
Mars or Galaxy shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1(e), and (C) concurrently with or within six (6) months after such
termination, the Mars shall have entered into a definitive agreement providing
for or consummates a Qualifying Transaction; or (iii) Galaxy shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(i) or 7.1(k), then in any
such event Mars shall pay to Galaxy a fee of $55,400,000 (the " _Mars
Termination Fee_ "), less the amount, if any, of the Mars Initial Termination
Fee previously paid, such payment to be made in the case of a termination by
Mars in the circumstances contemplated by clause (i), concurrently with such
termination, in the case of a termination by Galaxy in the circumstances
contemplated by either clause (i) or (iii), within two (2) Business Days
following the date of such termination, or in the case of clause (ii), upon
consummation of the Qualifying Transaction.

(e) The parties agree that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 and
the payments contemplated thereby are an integral part of the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and constitute liquidated damages and
not a penalty. So long as Mars shall not have otherwise breached its
obligations hereunder, if Mars fails to consummate the Mergers by the End Date
due solely to a Financing Failure, the termination fees contemplated by
Section 7.3(d)(i) and Section 7.3(d)(iii) (as it relates to a termination
pursuant to Section 7.1(i)) shall represent the sole and exclusive remedy of
Galaxy and its affiliates with respect to such Financing Failure. Following
the receipt by a party of a termination fee pursuant to this Section 7.3, in
each case to the extent such fee is or may be payable, the paying party shall
have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby to the receiving party or their respective stockholders or
affiliates (except in each case as contemplated by Section 7.3(b) or 7.3(d) in
the period following the time at which the Galaxy Initial Termination Fee or
the Mars Initial Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be paid pursuant to
Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(c), respectively, and except in the event of a Fault
Breach). Without limiting the provisions of Section 7.2, the obligations of
Galaxy or Mars to pay any termination fee, in each case as applicable pursuant
to the provisions of this Section 7.3, shall continue notwithstanding the
termination of this Agreement or the occurrence of the End Date. In no event
shall Galaxy be required to pay the Galaxy Initial Termination Fee, Galaxy be
required to pay the Galaxy Termination Fee, Mars be required to pay the Mars
Initial Termination Fee, or Mars be required to pay the Mars Termination Fee,
as applicable, on more than one occasion. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 7.3, if one party fails to pay promptly to
the other any fee due under this Section 7.3, in addition to any amounts paid
or  



 

-72-  payable pursuant to this Section 7.3, the defaulting party shall pay the
costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with
any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or legal action, taken to
collect payment, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee from
the date such fee was required to be paid at the prime lending rate as
reported in the _Wall Street Journal_ , plus 2%, on the date such fee was
required to be paid.
