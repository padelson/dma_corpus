ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 _The Merger_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted hereunder) of the conditions set forth in Article __ VI (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied or waived (if
permitted hereunder) at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions at the Closing), at
the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent.

(b) The consummation of the Merger shall take place at a closing (the "
_Closing_ ") to occur at the offices of DLA Piper LLP (US), 401 Congress
Avenue, Suite 2500, Austin, Texas 78701, on or prior to the third (3rd)
Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
hereunder) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions set forth
in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied or waived (if permitted hereunder) at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such
conditions at the Closing), or at such other location, date and time as Parent
and the Company shall mutually agree upon in writing. The date upon which the
Closing shall actually occur pursuant hereto is referred to herein as the "
_Closing Date_."

 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a
certificate of merger in requisite and customary form and substance with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and make all other filings or
recordings required by the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as the
certificate of merger is duly submitted to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as may be mutually
agreed to by the parties and as specified in the certificate of merger). 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to
all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the
Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under the DGCL.

 



2 Section 1.2 _Conversion of Shares of Common Stock_. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent,
Merger Subsidiary, the Company or the holders thereof:

 

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.2(b)_ or _Section_ __
_ 1.4_, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, each share of Company Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled
and cease to exist and shall be converted into the right to receive $5.50 in
cash, without interest (such amount, as may be adjusted in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.9_ of this Agreement, the " _Merger Consideration_ "), and
any holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto except to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 1.2(a)_;

 

(b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury
stock or owned by Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any other Subsidiary of Parent
or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

 

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.3 _Surrender and Payment_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Payment Agent_ ") for the purpose of acting
as the payment agent in the Merger. Promptly following the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit and make available to the Payment Agent the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of (i) the certificates representing
shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and (ii) __ the
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Uncertificated Shares_
") (but not any Merger Consideration in respect of any Dissenting Shares as
of the Effective Time or, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company Option
Merger Consideration, the Company RSU Merger Consideration or the Company
Restricted Share Merger Consideration) (the " _Payment Fund_ "). If for any
reason (including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to
which holders of shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under 
_Section 1.3(b)_, Parent shall take all steps necessary to enable or cause
the Surviving Corporation promptly to deposit (or cause to be deposited) in
trust additional cash with the Payment Agent sufficient to make all payments
required under this Agreement (but not any Merger Consideration in respect of
any Dissenting Shares as of the Effective Time or, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Company Option Merger Consideration, the Company RSU Merger Consideration
or the Company Restricted Share Merger Consideration). All cash deposited
with the Payment Agent shall only be used for the purposes provided in this
Agreement, or as otherwise agreed by the Company and Parent before the
Effective Time. Any income from investment of the Payment Fund will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation. Promptly after the Effective Time (but
in no event later than five __ (5) Business Days after the Effective Time),
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to send to each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time (other than the
Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any other Subsidiary of Parent, any
Company Subsidiary, or holders of Dissenting Shares who have not
subsequently withdrawn or lost their rights of appraisal), whether
represented by Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, a letter of transmittal,
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation,
and 

 



3  instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Payment Agent)
for use in the exchange of such shares for Merger Consideration pursuant to
and in accordance with _Section 1.3(b)_.

 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to and in
accordance with _Section 1.3(a)_ shall be entitled to receive, upon (i) __
surrender to the Payment Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agents message" by
the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment
Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of
Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Common Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share; _provided_
, that receipt of an "agents message" shall be deemed to be an express
acknowledgement that the holder of such Uncertificated Shares has received
and agrees to be bound by the terms of the letter of transmittal (and shall be
deemed to have delivered an executed copy thereof). Until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right
to receive such Merger Consideration, and any holder of such shares of Company
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto except
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.2(a)_. No
interest or dividends will be paid or accrue on any Merger Consideration
payable to holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) __ the Person requesting such payment
shall pay in advance to the Payment Agent any transfer or other Taxes required
as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of
the Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with
the procedures set forth, in this _Article I_.

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Payment
Agent pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock one year after the Effective Time shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand, and thereafter any such holder who has not
exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in
accordance with this _Section 1.3_ prior to that time shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent
shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company

 



4  Common Stock for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock two years after the
Effective Time (or, if earlier, immediately prior to such time when such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Payment
Agent pursuant to _Section 1.4_ in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.

 

Section 1.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement or the Proxy Statement, shares of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than shares of Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with _Section
1.2(b)_) and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption of this
Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who has properly exercised
appraisal rights of such shares in accordance with the DGCL (such shares being
referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as
such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be
converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and the holder thereof
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a
holder of Dissenting Shares; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
such holders right to appraisal pursuant to the DGCL, such shares of Company
Common Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 1.2(a)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender of
such Certificate formerly representing such share or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be, in compliance with _Section 1.3_.
The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that
relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to
participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands under the DGCL consistent with the obligations of the Company
thereunder. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. From and after the Effective
Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be entitled to exercise any of
the voting rights or other rights of an equity owner of the Surviving
Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent.

 



5 Section 1.5 _Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and conditioned upon the
occurrence of the Effective Time, and without any action on the part of any
holder of Company Options, except as set forth on Schedule 1.5(a):

(i) one hundred percent (100%) of each holders Vested Company Options, to
the extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, shall be canceled, with
each former holder of any such canceled Vested Company Option becoming
entitled to receive, at the Effective Time, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Vested Company Option, a total amount in cash (without
interest and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as
contemplated in _Section 1.6_), equal to _the product of_ : (1) __ the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of each such Company Option, _multiplied by_ (2) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock underlying such Company Option (the " _Company Option
Merger Consideration_ ");

(ii) thirty percent (30%) (rounded up to the nearest whole share) of the
total number of each holders Unvested Company Options which (A) are
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (B) __ have an
exercise price per share that is less than the Merger Consideration (the "
_Closing Options_ "), shall fully vest and become exercisable, and to the
extent not exercised prior to the Effective Time, each Closing Option shall be
canceled, with each former holder of any such canceled Closing Option
becoming entitled to receive, at the Effective Time, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Closing Option, a total amount in cash (without interest
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in
_ Section 1.6_), equal to the Company Option Merger Consideration with
respect to such Closing Option;

 

(iii) each holders remaining Unvested Company Options which are
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Remaining
Options_ ") shall be canceled, with each former holder of any such canceled
Remaining Option becoming eligible to receive, in consideration of the
cancellation of such Company Option, a total amount in cash (without interest
and subject to deduction for any required withholding Tax as contemplated in
_Section 1.6_), to be paid in accordance with _Section 1.5(a)(iv)_, equal to
the product of: (A) __ the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of each such Remaining Option, _multiplied by_
(B) __ the number of shares of Company Common Stock underlying such Remaining
Option (the " _Remaining Option Amount_ "); and

(iv) With respect to each cancelled Remaining Option, the holder of such
cancelled Remaining Option shall become vested in the Remaining Option Amount
in installments on the dates that the holder would have become vested (subject
to remaining employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
as applicable, through such date) in the Company Option pursuant to the
applicable award agreement (including any applicable acceleration provisions
with respect to vesting upon a termination of service), and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay (without interest and subject to deduction
for any withholding Tax as contemplated in _Section 1.6_) to the Covered
Employee that portion of the Remaining Option Amount that has become so vested
on the next regular payroll date of the Surviving Corporation following the
applicable vesting date;

_provided_ , _however_ , that, if the exercise price per share of any such
Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall be canceled and terminated without any cash payment being
made in respect thereof. If a holder of Company Options holds more than one
award of Company Options that have an exercise price per share that is less
than the Merger Consideration, each such award shall be divided ratably into

or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of any

(c) _Insurance_. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the Company shall purchase a six-
year "tail" prepaid policy on the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_"); provided that the Company does not

all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,

Surviving Corporation (or Parent) shall assume all of the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation set forth in this  _Section 5.9_.

(e) _No Impairment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. The obligations set forth
in this  _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise

without the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other

 



57  person who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy
referred to in _Section 5.9_(c) (and their heirs and representatives). Each

in existence with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
for any of their respective directors, officers or other employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section
5.9_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

Section 5.10 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to

in each case in connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Transaction Litigation_ ") (including by providing copies of all pleadings
and other documentation with respect thereto) and thereafter keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall (a)
give Parent reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement
or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation (to the extent that the attorney-
client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or
otherwise affected ( _provided_ that the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to allow for such participation in a manner that does not
violate attorney-client privilege)); and (b) __ consult with Parent with
respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation and consider any feedback from Parent in good faith. Further, the
Company may not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to
an arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has
consented thereto in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). None of the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary
shall cooperate with any Person that may seek to restrain, enjoin, prohibit or
otherwise oppose the Transactions, and the Company, Parent and Merger
Subsidiary shall reasonably cooperate with the other parties hereto in
resisting any such effort to restrain, enjoin, prohibit or otherwise oppose
such Transactions.

Section 5.11 _Rule 16b-3_. The Company shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause the Transactions, and any other dispositions of equity
securities (including derivative securities) of the Company by each individual
who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section __ 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule __
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

Section 5.12 _Employee Matters_.

58 (b) During the Continuation Period, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or any Company Subsidiary to, other than as agreed
in writing with any Covered Employee, provide to the Covered Employees for so
long as such Covered Employees remain employees of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Company Subsidiary during the Continuation Period,
compensation (such term to include salary, annual cash bonus opportunities,
commissions and severance) and benefits that are, in the aggregate, no less
favorable than the compensation (excluding any equity or equity-based
compensation, retention, change of control, transaction or similar bonuses,
and nonqualified deferred compensation) and material employee benefits
(excluding any defined benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits)
being provided to Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c) In the event any Covered Employee first becomes eligible to
participate under any employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
(" _Parent Employee Benefit Plan_ ") following the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, for Covered Employees who
become eligible during the calendar year including the Effective Time: (i)
waive any preexisting condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to any Covered Employee
under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, or vision
benefits to the same extent such limitation would have been waived or
satisfied under the Company Employee Benefit Plan that the Covered Employee
participated in immediately prior to coverage under the Parent Employee
Benefit Plan; and (ii) __ provide each Covered Employee with credit for any
copayments and deductibles paid prior to the Covered Employees coverage
under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan during the calendar year in which such
amount was paid, to the same extent such credit was given under the employee
benefit plan Covered Employee participated in immediately prior to coverage
under the Parent Employee Benefit Plan, in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Parent Employee Benefit
Plan.

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall recognize, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries to recognize, all
service of each Covered Employee prior to the Effective Time, to the Company
(or any predecessor entities of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries) for vesting and eligibility purposes (but, subject to
applicable local Law, not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined
benefit pension plan or retiree medical benefits, except for vacation and
severance, as applicable) to the same extent as such Covered Employee was
entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any
similar material Company Employee Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. In no event shall
anything contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12(d)_ result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.12_ are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and nothing in this _Section 5.12_ shall (i) be
construed to limit the right of Parent, the Company, or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) to amend or terminate any Company Employee Benefit Plan,
Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or

 



59  arrangement, (ii) __ be construed as an amendment to any Company Plan,
Company Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement, (iii) __ be construed to require Parent,

or (iv) confer upon or give to any Person (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any Company Employee or current or former employees, directors, or

of any provision of this Agreement.

accordance with its terms and survive the termination of this Agreement,
except as expressly modified herein; _provided_ , that the Confidentiality
Agreement shall automatically terminate at the Effective Time.

 

Section 5.14 _Midco Transaction_. Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary has
any plan or intention to take any action with respect to the Company
subsequent to the Closing that would cause the Transactions to constitute part
of a transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

 

Section 5.15 _Obligations of Merger Subsidiary_. Parent shall take all

Agreement, which shall include any required notifications and consultation and

from any works council, economic committee, union or similar body or (ii) __
establish that the parties hereto are permitted to effect the Closing without
such opinion or acknowledgment.

Period, Parent shall give, as soon as reasonably practicable, notice to the
Company, and the Company shall give, as soon as reasonably practicable, notice
to the Parent, respectively, of, to such partys Knowledge, (a) __
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or
failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty
of such Person (or, in the case of the Parents obligation to provide notice,
any representation or warranty of the Merger Subsidiary) contained in this
Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate (i) __ in the case of any representation
or warranty of the Company, in any manner that would result in the failure of

Section 5.18 to terminate this agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ or
_Section 7.1(f)_, respectively, the failure to give any such notice shall

contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (a) __ take such actions to ensure that the

Alternative Acquisition Agreement (including with respect to the Competing
Acquisition Transaction referenced in clause (B) of this sentence) and a
Competing Acquisition Transaction (including the Competing Acquisition
Transaction referenced in clause (B) of this sentence) is subsequently
consummated, then within two (2) Business Days after consummation of such
Competing Acquisition Transaction, the Company shall pay to Parent (or its
designee) the Company Termination Fee, less, other than in the case of fraud
or willful breach, the amount of any Parent Expenses previously paid to
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.4(d)_ (if any), by wire transfer of immediately
available funds. " _Company Termination Fee_ " means an amount equal
to $18,270,000.

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(e)_ , then as a condition to such termination of this Agreement, the
Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee on

Parent (or its designee) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent.

(iv) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than
one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under
more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times
and the occurrence of different events.

(b) _Parent Termination Fee_.

 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
7.1(i)_ , then within two (2) Business Days after the date of termination,

and the occurrence of different events.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event that the Company has exercised or attempted to exercise its rights to
specific performance as provided in _Section 8.5_ , the Company shall not be
entitled to the Parent Termination Fee unless the Company has terminated this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(i)_ on or before the tenth (10th) Business
Day after an Order denying the Company a grant of specific performance to
consummate the Closing as provided in _Section 8.5_ has become effective,
final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that the
Closing has occurred, the Company shall not under any circumstances be
entitled to the Parent Termination Fee or any other damages.

 

(c) _Parent Expenses_. In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1_ _(f)_ then, within two (2) Business Days after

respect of reasonable and documented fees and expenses (including legal fees
and expenses) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates either (x) on or prior to
the termination of this Agreement in connection with the Transactions
(including the Financing) or (y) __in connection with any Legal Proceeding in
respect of this Agreement after such termination (the " _Parent Expenses_ ")
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by Parent; _provided_ , that the existence of
circumstances which could require the Company Termination Fee to become
subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)(i)_ shall not
relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant to
this _Section 7.4(c)_ ; _provided_ , _further_ , that the payment by the
Company of Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.4(c)_ shall not relieve
the Company of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)(i)_. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) in no event
shall the Company be required to pay the Parent Expenses on more than one (1)
occasion and (y) other than in the case of fraud or willful breach, in no
event shall _the sum of_ the Parent Expenses _and_ the Company Termination
Fee payable by the Company exceed an amount equal to the Company Termination
Fee.

(d) _Acknowledgement_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that:

(i) the covenants set forth in this _Section 7.4_ are an integral part of
this Agreement and the Transactions, and that, without these agreements,
Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company would not have entered into this
Agreement;

 

(ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under
circumstances where a Company Termination Fee or a Parent Termination Fee is
payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the
amounts payable pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ or _Section 7.4(b)_ are not a
penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate Parent or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions, or any other matter forming the basis for any losses or
damages suffered or incurred, and shall be

 



68  (other than in the case of fraud) (A) in addition to the Parent Expenses (if
applicable), the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of a termination
of this Agreement where the Company Termination Fee is payable by the Company
pursuant to _Section 7.4(a)_ and the Company Termination Fee is actually paid
to Parent and (ii) the sole monetary remedy of the Company in the event of a
termination of this Agreement where the Parent Termination Fee is payable by
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.4(b)_ and the Parent Termination Fee is
actually paid to the Company; and

 

(iii) (A) in the event that the Parent shall accept the Company Termination
Fee and any Parent Expenses (if applicable) as provided under this _Section
7.4_ , (I) the receipt of such amounts shall be Parents and Merger
Subsidiarys sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement (other than in the
case of fraud), (II) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary shall no longer be entitled to seek specific performance
pursuant to _Section 8.5_ and (III) other than in the case of fraud, none of
Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any of their respective Affiliates or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal Proceeding
against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement,
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis
for such termination and the Parent shall cause any such Legal Proceeding
brought by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their Affiliates, and shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall be understood not to
include the payment of any material out-of-pocket monies or the agreement to
any material undertaking) to cause any Legal Proceeding brought by any other
Person, to be dismissed with prejudice promptly (or not undertaken, as
applicable) and any event within three (3) Business Days following the
payment of the Company Termination Fee and any Parent Expenses (if
applicable); and (B) in the event that the Company shall accept the Parent
Termination Fee as provided under this _Section 7.4_ , (I) the receipt of
such fee shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement
(other than in the case of fraud), (II) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the Company shall no longer be entitled to seek
specific performance pursuant to _Section 8.5_ and (III) other than in the
case of fraud, none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any other Person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal Proceeding against
Parent, Merger Subsidiary, any Debt Financing Source or any of their
respective Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination and
the Company shall cause any such Legal Proceeding brought by the Company or
its Affiliates, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall
be understood not to include the payment of any material out-of-pocket monies
or the agreement to any material undertaking) to cause any Legal Proceeding
brought by any other Person, to be dismissed with prejudice promptly (or not
undertaken, as applicable) and in any event within three (3) Business Days
from the payment of the Parent Termination Fee. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent any party hereto seeks specific
performance pursuant to _Section 8.5_ , the Termination Date shall be
automatically extended to (x) the tenth (10th) Business Day following the
date on which an Order with respect to such request for specific performance
has become effective, final and nonappealable, or (y) __ such other time
period established in such Order.

Section 8.5 _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; Remedies_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL
BE INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES
THEREOF TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER
JURISDICTION. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such
Court of Chancery shall lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal courts
of the United States of America located in the County of New Castle, Delaware,
solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of
(and any claim or cause of action arising under or relating to) this Agreement
and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
Transactions, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any
action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof or of
any such document, that it is not subject thereto or that such action, suit or
proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that
the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such
document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto
irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, proceeding or
transactions shall be heard and determined in such courts. The parties hereto
hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the person of
such parties and, to the extent permitted by Law, over the subject matter of
such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection
with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 8.7_ or
in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof. 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TO
THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL
BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE FINANCING COMMITMENT LETTERS OR THE

ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) __ NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER

71  FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY
AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE

CONTAINED IN THIS _SECTION 8.5_.

 

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this
Agreement (including any party hereto failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder in order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that, subject to _Section 7.4_ , (A) the parties
hereto will be entitled, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity, to seek an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or threatened breaches) of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof;
(B) the provisions of  _Section 7.4_ are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger
Subsidiary, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a breach of
this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any partys right to an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the Transactions and without that right, neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific
performance to cause Parent and/or Merger Subsidiary to draw down the
full proceeds of the Equity Financing and to cause Parent or Merger
Subsidiary to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions
in this Agreement, if, and only if, (A) all conditions set forth in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, _provided_ that such conditions are reasonably
capable of being satisfied) have been satisfied or waived, (B) the Debt
Financing (or, if Alternative Debt Financing with respect thereto is being
used in accordance with _Section 5.8(c)_ , pursuant to the New Debt Commitment
Letters) has been funded or the Debt Financing Sources have provided
definitive confirmations to Parent in writing that the Debt Financing will be
funded at the Closing (in each case in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Debt Commitment Letters) if the Equity Financing is funded
at the Closing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity
Commitment Letter and (C) __ the Company has irrevocably confirmed in a
written notice to Parent that (1) all of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.1_ and _Section 6.3_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, _provided_ that such conditions are
reasonably capable of being satisfied) have been satisfied or waived, and (2)
if specific performance is granted and the Financing is consummated, then the
Closing will occur.

 

(d) Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that the rights to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy contemplated
herein are an integral part of the Transactions and without such right, none
of the parties hereto would have entered into this Agreement. The parties
hereto hereby agree not to raise any objections to the availability of
the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement by any party hereto, and to
specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of any party under this Agreement. Any party hereto
seeking an

 



72  injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with such
injunction or enforcement, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right
that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such
bond or other security. The parties hereto further agree that nothing set
forth in this _Section 8.5_ shall require any party hereto to institute any
proceeding for specific performance under this _Section 8.5_ prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under _Article VII_ (and
pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any
Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ or anything set forth in this
_Section 8.5_ restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this Agreement
in accordance with the terms of _Article VII_ or pursue any other remedies
under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that the Company
pursues the collection of damages from Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of
their Affiliates, in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions (other
than for fraud), (i) the parties hereto agree that such damages shall not in
any event be in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination Fee, (ii) the
receipt of such damages shall be the Companys sole and exclusive remedy under
this Agreement and shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, (iii) notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, the Company shall no longer be entitled to seek specific
performance pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ and (iv) none of the Company nor
any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal
Proceeding against Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or any matters forming the basis for such damages claim and the Company
shall cause any such Legal Proceeding brought by the Company or its
Affiliates, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which shall be
understood not to include the payment of any out-of-pocket monies or the
agreement to any material undertaking) to cause any Legal Proceeding brought
by any other Person, to be dismissed with prejudice promptly (or not
undertaken, as applicable) and in any event within three (3) Business Days
from the payment of such damages.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event that Parent or
Merger Subsidiary pursues the collection of damages from the Company or any
of its Affiliates, in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions
(other than for fraud), (i) the parties agree that such damages shall not in
any event be in excess of the amount of the Company Termination Fee plus
Parent Expenses, (ii) the receipt of such damages shall be Parents and Merger
Subsidiarys sole and exclusive remedy under this Agreement and shall be
deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered
or incurred by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter
forming the basis for such termination, (iii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall no longer be entitled to
seek specific performance pursuant to this _Section 8.5_ and (iv) neither
Parent, nor Merger Subsidiary, nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal Proceeding against the
Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of this Agreement, any of the
transactions

 



73  contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such damages claim
and Parent shall cause any such Legal Proceeding brought by the Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any of their respective Affiliates, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts (which shall be understood not to include the
payment of any out-of-pocket monies or the agreement to any material
undertaking) to cause any Legal Proceeding brought by any other Person, to be
dismissed with prejudice promptly (or not undertaken, as applicable) and in
any event within three (3) Business Days from the payment of such damages.

 

Section 8.6 _Assignment_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 8.11(c)_, neither
this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto, in whole or in part (whether
by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the
other parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such
consent shall be null and void, except that each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement to any one or more direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiaries of Parent without the consent of the
Company, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of

sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
