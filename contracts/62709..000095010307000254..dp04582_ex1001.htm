 2

exercise prices of such In-the-Money Company Options by (y) the Per Class B
Share Price.

 

  "Class A Share" means a Class A common share, par value $0.01 per

account after the Base Date, as of the date of the applicable Investment
Advisory Agreements for such Client or such new account, as applicable), as
adjusted to reflect additions and withdrawals from such account made by such
Client from and after such date through and including the Closing Date. For
purposes of the foregoing, (i) for the avoidance of doubt, ordinary course
dividends by Funds to their investors shall not constitute "withdrawals", (ii)

Affiliate has investment discretion with respect to such investment shall be
excluded (it being understood and agreed that assets invested by defined
contribution or defined benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Seller or
any of its controlled Affiliates shall not fall within the scope of this
exclusion) and (vi) withdrawals and redemptions shall be taken into account
when they are actually funded out of the applicable account or, if earlier,

of doubt, the calculation of Closing Adjusted Assets Under Management is
intended to exclude any increase or decrease in assets under management
resulting from market appreciation or depreciation or currency fluctuations
from and after the Base Date (or in the case of a Person that becomes a Client
after such date, or a Client as of such date that establishes a new account
after the Base Date, as of the date such Person becomes a Client or
establishes such new account, as applicable).

 

  "Closing Date" means the date of the Closing.

 

  "Closing Revenue Run-Rate" means, with respect to a Client, the product
of (x) the Closing Adjusted Assets Under Management for such Client
multiplied by (y) the aggregate annualized rate of investment advisory, sub-
advisory or management fees (after giving effect to, and taking into account,
any fee or expense waivers, caps or limitations), determined on a basis
consistent with Schedule A, as of the Closing Date that are computed
primarily by reference to the assets of such Client under the management of a

 ARTICLE 2 
 PURCHASE AND SALE

 

  Section 2.01 _. Purchase and Sale._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell to Buyer, and Buyer
agrees to purchase from Seller, all of the issued and outstanding Class A
Shares, free and clear of any Liens, at the Closing for the purchase price set
forth in Section 2.01(b)(i) . In addition, effective at Closing, all of the
issued and outstanding Class B Shares and Company Options shall be cancelled
in accordance with the terms of the Equity Partnership Plan in consideration
of the payments set forth in Section 2.01(b)(ii) .

 

  (b) The aggregate amount payable by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.01(a)
for the purchase of the Class A Shares, and in consideration of the
cancellation of the Class B Shares and the Company Options, is $3,900,000,000
in cash (the "Aggregate Purchase Price"). The Aggregate Purchase Price shall
be paid as provided in Section 2.02, shall be subject to adjustment as
provided in Sections 2.04 and 2.06, and shall be allocated (after giving
effect to the redemption of certain Class A Shares pursuant to Section 7.05)
among the Class A Shares, the Class B Shares and the Company Options
outstanding immediately prior to Closing as follows:

 

>  
>
> (i) for the Class A Shares, the Class A Ownership Percentage of the
> Aggregate Purchase Price (the "Class A Purchase Price", and the  Class A
> Purchase Price divided by the number of Class A Shares outstanding
> immediately prior to Closing, the "Per Class A Share Price");
>
>  
>
> (ii) for the Class B Shares and the Company Options, the Class B
> Ownership Percentage of the Aggregate Purchase Price, allocated among the
> Class B Shares and the Company Options as follows:
>
>  
>

>>  

>>

>> (A) for each Class B Share that is vested immediately prior to Closing
(including as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
(1) an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of a  Class B Share (as defined,
for purposes of this Agreement, in the Equity Partnership Plan) as of
September 30,

>>

>>  

>
>  

 

 17    
  
 

>  
>

>>  

>>

>>   2006 (the "Vested Class B Share Closing Payment") plus (2) an amount
equal to the excess of the Per Class A Share Price over the Fair Market Value
of a Class B  Share (the "Vested Class B Share Trust Payment" and, together
with the Vested Class B Share Closing Payment, the "Per Class B Share 
Price");

>>

>>  

>>

>> (B) for each Class B Share that is not vested immediately prior to
Closing, an amount equal to the Per Class A Share Price (the "Unvested Class B
Share Trust  Payment");

>>

>>  

>>

>> (C) for each Company Option that is vested immediately prior to
Closing (including as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), (1) an amount equal to the product of (x) the number  of Class B
Shares subject to such Company Option ("Vested Option Shares") and (y) the
excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value of a Class B Share over the exercise
price per Class  B Share for such Company Option (the "Vested Option Closing
Payment") plus (2) an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Vested
Option Shares and (y) an amount equal to  the excess of the Per Class A Share
Price over the greater of (X) the Fair Market Value of a Class B Share and (Y)
the exercise price per Class B Share for such Company Option (the "Vested
Option Trust  Payment"); and

>>

>>  

>>

>> (D) for each Company Option that is not vested immediately prior to
Closing, an amount equal to the product of (1) the number of Class B Shares
subject to such Company Option and (2) the excess of the  Per Class A Share
Price over the exercise price per Class B Share for such Company Option (the
"Unvested Option Trust Payment").

>>

>>  

>
>  

 

  For the avoidance of doubt, all Company Options that are not In-the-
Money Company Options shall, effective at Closing, be cancelled in accordance
with the terms of the Equity Partnership Plan for no consideration.

 

  The parties hereby agree that the aggregate amount payable by Buyer
pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above in respect of the purchase of the Class
A Shares and the cancellation of the Class B Shares and Company Options shall
equal the Aggregate Purchase Price, as adjusted as provided in Sections 2.04
and 2.06.

 

  (c) No later than three Business Days prior to the date on which the
Closing is scheduled to occur, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a certificate
setting forth the allocation, in accordance with Section 2.01(b), of the
Aggregate

 

 18    
  
 

 Purchase Price at Closing pursuant to Section 2.02, which allocation shall
be reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

 

  Section 2.02 _. Closing._ The closing (the "Closing") of the purchase
and sale of the Class A Shares hereunder shall take place at 9:00 a.m. (EST)
at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New
York, as soon as possible, but in no event (subject to the proviso at the end
of this sentence) later than five Business Days, after satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article 10 (or waiver by the party or parties entitled
to the benefit of such conditions) (the day of such satisfaction or waiver,
the "Satisfaction Date"), or at such other time or place as Buyer and Seller
may agree; _provided_ that if, assuming the Closing occurred on
the Satisfaction Date, the Estimated Closing Revenue Run-Rate would be less
than 93% of the Aggregate Base Revenue Run-Rate, Seller may require, by
delivering written notice to Buyer no later than five Business Days prior to
the anticipated Closing Date, that the Closing be delayed until a date
specified by Seller no later than 30 days following the Satisfaction Date (but
in no event later than the Outside Date). At the Closing:

 

  (a) Seller shall settle the net intercompany account balance between
Seller and the Company Entities as of the Closing in accordance with Section
7.05(a) .

 

  (b) Buyer shall deliver to Seller the Class A Purchase Price in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account of Seller with a
bank in New York City designated by Seller, by notice to Buyer, which notice
shall be delivered not later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

  (c) Buyer shall deliver (on behalf of the Company in accordance with
the Equity Partnership Plan) the aggregate Vested Class B Share Closing
Payment and the aggregate Vested Option Closing Payment in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to the holders of the Class B Shares and
Company Options immediately prior to Closing in accordance with a schedule to
be delivered by Seller to Buyer not later than two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

 

  (d) Buyer shall deposit (on behalf of the Company in accordance with
the Equity Partnership Plan), or shall cause to be deposited, an amount equal
to the aggregate Vested Class B Share Trust Payment, the aggregate Unvested
Class B Share Trust Payment, the aggregate Vested Option Trust Payment and the
aggregate Unvested Option Trust Payment (collectively, the "Trust Amount") 
_less_ (pursuant to Section 2.03(a)) the Adjustment Amount, by wire transfer
of immediately available funds into one or more grantor trusts established by
the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Partnership
Plan prior to Closing (each, a "Grantor Trust") in accordance with a schedule
to be delivered by Seller to Buyer not later than two Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

 

 19    
  
 

  (e) Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, the Adjustment
Amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds with the Adjustment
Account Agent.

 

  (f) Seller shall deliver to Buyer certificates (to the extent
certificated) for the Class A Shares duly endorsed or accompanied by stock
powers duly endorsed in blank, with any required transfer stamps affixed
thereto.

 

  For the avoidance of doubt, the amounts payable by Buyer at Closing
pursuant to this Section 2.02 shall reflect any adjustments to the Aggregate
Purchase Price based on the Estimated Closing Stockholders Equity and the
Estimated Closing Revenue Run-Rate pursuant to Section 2.04.

 

  Section 2.03 _. Adjustment Account._ (a) Buyer and Seller agree that at
the Closing, the Adjustment Amount shall be withheld from the Trust Amount,
and such withheld amount shall be deposited with the Adjustment Account Agent
by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to Section 2.02(e) .
The Adjustment Amount shall be applied by the Adjustment Account Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Adjustment Account Agreement to pay any
amounts owing under Section 2.06, with any remaining funds to be paid in
accordance with Section 2.03(b) .

 

  (b) Immediately following the determination of Final Stockholders
Equity and Final Closing Revenue Run-Rate, any remaining funds in the
Adjustment Account (after any payments from, or deposits into, the Adjustment
Account pursuant to Section 2.05) shall be released from the Adjustment
Account for payment to the appropriate Grantor Trust.

 

  Section 2.04 _. Estimates of Closing Stockholders  Equity and
Aggregate Closing Revenue Run-Rate; Pre-Closing Adjustment of Aggregate
Purchase Price. _(a) No later than four Business Days prior to the date on
which the Closing is scheduled to occur, Seller shall cause to be prepared by
the Companys Chief Financial Officer and shall deliver to Buyer (i) a
certificate of the Companys Chief Financial Officer setting forth a good
faith estimate of the Closing Balance Sheet and, based on such estimated
Closing Balance Sheet, a good faith estimate of Closing Stockholders Equity
(the "Estimated Closing Stockholders Equity") and (ii) a good faith estimate
of the Aggregate Closing Revenue Run-Rate ("Estimated Closing Revenue Run-
Rate"). Seller shall also deliver to Buyer copies of all work papers and other
documents used in the calculation of Estimated Closing Stockholders Equity
and Estimated Closing Revenue Run-Rate as necessary to allow Buyer and Seller
to review the adjustments to the Aggregate Purchase Price under Section
2.04(b) and (c) determined on the basis of the certificate of the Companys
Chief Financial Officer referred to above. The certificates and estimates of
the Companys Chief Financial Officer delivered pursuant to this Section
2.04(a) and pursuant to Section 2.05(a) shall be based on

 

 20    
  
 

 his actual knowledge, and shall not give rise to any personal or other
liability whatsoever to him.

 

  (b) If Target Stockholders Equity exceeds Estimated Closing
Stockholders Equity, the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be decreased by the
amount of such excess. If Estimated Closing Stockholders Equity exceeds
Target Stockholders Equity, the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be increased
by the amount of such excess. "Target Stockholders Equity" means
$544,367,000.

 

  (c) If the Estimated Closing Revenue Run-Rate is less than 93% of the
Aggregate Base Revenue Run Rate, then the Aggregate Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Estimated Revenue Run-Rate Adjustment Amount.

 

  Section 2.05 _. Post-Closing Calculation of Closing Stockholders 
Equity and Closing Revenue Run-Rate. _(a) As promptly as practicable, but no
later than 45 days, after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared by
the Companys Chief Financial Officer and delivered to Seller (i) the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company Entities as of the close of business
on the Business Day immediately prior to the Closing Date prepared in
accordance with the accounting principles, policies, practices and
methodologies used in connection with the preparation of the Balance Sheet,
except as set forth in Schedule B (the "Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) a
schedule, prepared on a basis consistent with the preparation of, and in a
form consistent with, Schedule A, setting forth a calculation of
the Aggregate Closing Revenue Run-Rate (prepared in accordance with the
methodology used in the calculation of the Aggregate Base Revenue Run-Rate as
set forth in Schedule A and the definition of Closing Adjusted Assets Under
Management) (the "Closing Run-Rate Schedule"). Each of the Closing Balance
Sheet and Closing Run-Rate Schedule will be accompanied by a certificate of
the Companys Chief Financial Officer specifying that it was prepared in
accordance with the provisions of this Section and setting forth Buyers
calculation of Closing Stockholders Equity and the Aggregate Closing Revenue
Run-Rate, as applicable, in reasonable detail.

 

  (b) If Seller disagrees with Buyers calculations of Closing
Stockholders Equity or Aggregate Closing Revenue Run-Rate delivered pursuant
to Section 2.05(a), Seller may, within 45 days after delivery of the
documents referred to in Section 2.05(a), deliver a notice to Buyer
disagreeing with such calculations and which specifies Sellers calculations
of such amounts and, in reasonable detail, Sellers grounds for
such disagreement. Any such notice of disagreement shall specify those items
or amounts as to which Seller disagrees, and Seller shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Balance Sheet
and the calculation of Closing Stockholders Equity or in the Closing Run-
Rate Schedule and the calculation of

 

 21    
  
 

 the Aggregate Closing Revenue Run-Rate, as applicable, delivered pursuant to
Section 2.05(a) .

 

  (c) If a notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to
Section 2.05(b), Buyer and Seller shall, during the 15 days following such
delivery, use their reasonable best efforts to reach agreement on the
disputed items or amounts in order to determine, as may be required, the
amount of Closing Stockholders Equity or Aggregate Closing Revenue Run-Rate,
as applicable, which amounts shall not be less than the amounts thereof shown
in Buyers calculations delivered pursuant to Section 2.05(a) nor more than
the amounts thereof shown in Sellers calculation delivered pursuant to
Section 2.05(b) . If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach such agreement
during such period, they shall promptly thereafter cause independent
accountants of internationally recognized standing reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer and Seller (who shall not have any material relationship with Buyer or
Seller) (the "Accounting Referee") promptly to review this Agreement and the
disputed items or amounts for the purpose of calculating Closing Stockholders
Equity or Aggregate Closing Revenue Run-Rate, as applicable. In making such
calculations, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Balance Sheet or Buyers calculation of Closing
Stockholders Equity, or in the Closing Run-Rate Schedule or Buyers
calculation of Aggregate Closing Revenue Run-Rate, as applicable, as to which
Seller has disagreed. The Accounting Referee shall deliver to Buyer and
Seller, as promptly as practicable (but in all events no later than 45 days
after the matter is referred to the Accounting Referee), a report setting
forth the Accounting Referees calculation of Closing Stockholders Equity or
Aggregate Closing Revenue Run-Rate, as applicable. Such report shall be final
and binding upon Buyer and Seller. The cost of such review and report shall
be allocated between Seller and Buyer in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the items unsuccessfully disputed by each (as finally
determined by the Accounting Referee) bears to the total amount of the
disputed items.

 

  (d) Buyer and Seller agree that they will, and agree to cause their
respective independent accountants and each Company Entity to, cooperate and
assist in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing Run-Rate
Schedule and the calculation of Closing Stockholders Equity and Aggregate
Closing Revenue Run-Rate and in the conduct of the reviews referred to in this
Section 2.05, including the making available to the extent necessary of
books, records, work papers and personnel.

 

  (e) For the avoidance of doubt, the calculation of Closing
Stockholders Equity to be made pursuant to this Section 2.05, and the
purchase price adjustment to be made pursuant to Section 2.06(a), is only
meant to reflect changes in stockholders equity (as adjusted) of the Company
Entities from the date of the Balance Sheet to the date of the Closing Balance
Sheet. Neither

 

 22    
  
 

 Section 2.05 nor Section 2.06(a) is intended to be used to adjust for errors
or omissions that may be found with respect to the Balance Sheet or any
inconsistencies between the Balance Sheet, on the one hand, and GAAP, on
the other, for which Article 11 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy.

 

  Section 2.06 _. Post-Closing Adjustment of Aggregate Purchase Price._
(a) If Estimated Closing Stockholders Equity exceeds Final Stockholders
Equity, Buyer shall be entitled to receive a payment (i) from Seller equal to
the Class A Ownership Percentage of the amount of such excess and (ii) from
the Adjustment Account in accordance with the terms of the Adjustment Account
Agreement equal to the Class B Ownership Percentage of the amount of such
excess, in each case in the manner and with interest as provided in Section
2.06(d) . If Final Stockholders Equity exceeds Estimated Closing
Stockholders Equity, Buyer shall (i) pay the Class A Ownership Percentage of
the amount of such excess to Seller and (ii) deposit the Class B Ownership
Percentage of the amount of such excess to the Adjustment Account, in each
case in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.06(d) .

 

  (b) If the Final Revenue Run-Rate Adjustment Amount exceeds the
Estimated Revenue Run-Rate Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall be entitled to
receive a payment (i) from Seller equal to the Class A Ownership Percentage
of the amount of such excess and (ii) from the Adjustment Account in
accordance with the terms of the Adjustment Account Agreement equal to the
Class B Ownership Percentage of the amount of such excess, in each case in
the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.06(d) . If the
Estimated Revenue Run-Rate Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final Revenue Run-
Rate Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall (i) pay the Class A Ownership Percentage
of the amount of such excess to Seller and (ii) deposit the Class B Ownership
Percentage of the amount of such excess to the Adjustment Account, in each
case in the manner and with interest as provided in Section 2.06(d) .

 

  (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for
purposes of determining Final Closing Revenue Run-Rate and the Final Revenue
Run-Rate Adjustment Amount, any Post-Closing Continuing Clients shall be
treated as Consenting Clients as of the Closing Date. "Post-Closing Continuing
Client" means a Client that (i) was not a Consenting Client as of the Closing
Date, but that has not, on or prior to the date that is 30 days after the
Closing Date, terminated its Investment Advisory Agreement (or has, on or
before such date, entered into a new Investment Advisory Agreement with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries), (ii) continues to be a Client of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of such date and (iii) has not submitted
to a Company Entity a withdrawal notice (which is recorded as such in the
Companys internal reporting systems in the ordinary course consistent with
past practices) that has not been revoked (as recorded in the Companys
internal reporting systems in the ordinary course consistent with past
practices) prior to such date.

 

 23    
  
 

  (d) Any payment pursuant to Section 2.06(a) or (b) shall be made at a
mutually convenient time and place within 10 days after the Final
Stockholders Equity or Final Closing Revenue Run-Rate, as applicable, has
been determined, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. Any payment
that is made to Buyer from the Adjustment Account shall be made to the account
of Buyer designated by Buyer in writing, and shall be accompanied by
the portion of interest earned on funds in the Adjustment Account that is
attributable to such payment. Any payment that is to be made to Buyer by
Seller shall be made to the account of Buyer designated by Buyer in writing,
and shall be accompanied by an interest payment on such amount from and
including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per
annum equal to the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern
Edition in effect from time to time during the period from the Closing Date
to the date of payment. Any payment that is to be made by Buyer shall be made
to the account of Seller, designated by Seller in writing, and the account(s)
of one or more Grantor Trusts designated by the Companys Chief Financial
Officer, and shall be accompanied by an interest payment on such amount from
and including the Closing Date to but excluding the date of payment at a rate
per annum equal to the average daily Prime Rate as published in the
Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition in effect from time to time during the
period from the Closing Date to the date of payment.

 

  Section 2.07 _. Certain Structuring Considerations._ (a) Buyer and
Seller shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to obtain
a Finance Comfort Letter, a CRA Tax Ruling or a CRA Comfort Letter (any of a
Finance Comfort Letter, a CRA Tax Ruling or CRA Comfort Letter being referred
to herein as an "NRT Exemption Confirmation") as promptly as practical after
the date hereof. All determinations with respect to the process for obtaining
any such NRT Exemption Confirmation shall be made jointly by Buyer and Seller,
each acting reasonably, in good faith and reasonably taking into account the
interests of the Class B Holders. Any such NRT Exemption Confirmation shall be
in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller.

 

  (b) Seller will make a Pre-Closing Notification in respect of the
disposition of the Class A Shares as promptly as practical after the date
hereof and in any event no later than 20 days after the date hereof and will
deliver to Buyer prior to the Closing Date any Pre-Closing Clearance
Certificate that is received by Seller in respect of the disposition of the
Class A Shares. Seller will use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Pre-
Closing Clearance Certificate in respect of the disposition of the Class A
Shares from the CRA. Seller will keep Buyer reasonably informed regarding the
status of its Pre-Closing Notification in respect of the disposition of the
Class A Shares and CRAs review thereof, and consult with Buyer in the event
any difficulties arise. Seller will provide Buyer with an opportunity to
review and comment on Sellers Pre-Closing Notification in respect of the
disposition of the Class A Shares and any other written correspondence with
CRA before it is submitted to CRA. Seller will use its

 

24    
  
 

 reasonable best efforts to cause each holder of a Class B Share and each
holder of an In-the-Money Company Option (collectively, the "Class B
Holders"), to make a Pre-Closing Notification in respect of the disposition
of such Class B Holders Class B Shares and In-the-Money Company Options and
to deliver to Buyer prior to the Closing Date any Pre-Closing Clearance
Certificate that is received by such Class B Holder in respect of the
disposition of such Class B Holders Class B Shares and In-the-Money Company
Options.

 

  (c) Provided that Buyer has used its reasonable best efforts to obtain
an NRT Exemption Confirmation, if, on the Satisfaction Date, (i) Buyer and
Seller have not received an NRT Exemption Confirmation and (ii) Seller has
not received a Pre-Closing Clearance Certificate, then:

 

>  
>

>>  

>>

>> (A) Buyer and Seller agree that the Closing shall be delayed until the
earliest to occur of (w) the receipt of an NRT Exemption Confirmation, (x) the
receipt by Seller of a Pre-Closing Clearance  Certificate, (y) the date on
which the Withholding Restructuring Steps (as defined herein) occur and (z)
five days prior to the Outside Date (it being understood (i) that the Closing
shall occur as promptly as practical after such earliest date and  (ii) that
if no Withholding Restructuring Step has occurred by the time described in
clause (z) hereof, the Closing shall be consummated without regarding to any
Withholding Restructuring Step);

>>

>>  

>>

>> (B) As promptly as practical after the Satisfaction Date, Buyer shall
use reasonable best efforts to propose an alternative method of effecting the
transactions contemplated hereby that is designed to  assure that Buyer and
the Company are not required to withhold any amounts from the Aggregate
Purchase Price pursuant to subsection 116(5) of the Canadian Tax Act (any such
modification, a "Withholding Restructuring  Step");

>>

>>  

>>

>> (C) Seller agrees to implement, as promptly as practical after Buyer
proposes a Withholding Restructuring Step pursuant to clause (B) of this
Section 2.07(c), such Withholding Restructuring Step to  the greatest extent
permitted by Applicable Law; and

>>

>>  

>>

>> (D) Seller and Buyer agree to amend this Agreement, on terms and
conditions acceptable to Buyer and Seller, to provide for the occurrence of
such Withholding Restructuring Step;

>>

>>  

>
>  

 

 25    
  
 

  _provided_ that (I) no Withholding Restructuring Step shall affect the
amount of the Aggregate Purchase Price and (II) Seller shall have no
obligation to agree to any such Withholding Restructuring Step unless Buyer
agrees to indemnify Seller and each Class B Holder and their respective
officers, directors, employees and Affiliates for any and all Damages incurred
by any of them arising by reason of Sellers agreement to consummate
such Withholding Restructuring Step or the consummation of such Withholding
Restructuring Step (including any incremental Taxes of Seller, a Class B
Holder or such other person that are attributable to such Withholding
Restructuring Step, any costs associated with amending this Agreement to
provide for such Withholding Restructuring Step and any costs of implementing
such Withholding Restructuring Step) (it being understood that,
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this clause (II), Seller will
bear a reasonable level of legal costs in connection with the modifications
contemplated by this Section 2.07(c)) .

 

  (d) Prior to the Closing, Buyer and Seller agree (i) to discuss in good
faith certain modifications to the method of effecting the transactions
contemplated hereby, including Buyers acquisition of the Company, as well as
certain transactions concerning the Company and its Affiliates anticipated to
be effected before or following completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including (W) the manner in which the Class B Shares and In-the-Money
Company Options are acquired, (X) the conversion of certain Company Entities
to limited partnerships prior to Closing, (Y) the separate purchase by Buyer
of Company Entities other than the Company and (Z) the acquisition of the
Company by Buyer by way of a forward merger under Applicable Law) that are
intended to maximize the Tax efficiency to Buyer and its Affiliates of the
transactions contemplated hereby (each such modification, a
"General Restructuring Step") and (ii) to the extent that Buyer and Seller
agree to effect General Restructuring Steps, to amend this Agreement, on terms
and conditions acceptable to Buyer and Seller, to provide for the occurrence
of such General Restructuring Steps; _provided_ that (A) Seller shall have no
obligation to agree to consummate any General Restructuring Step if Seller, in
its sole discretion, acting in good faith, determines that it or the Class B
Holders are adversely affected thereby; (B) no General Restructuring Step
shall affect the amount of the Aggregate Purchase Price; (C) Buyer shall agree
to indemnify Seller and each Class B Holder and their respective officers,
directors, employees and affiliates for any and all Damages incurred by any of
them arising by reason of Sellers agreement to consummate such General
Restructuring Step or the consummation of such General Restructuring Step
(including any additional Taxes of Seller, a Class B Holder or such other
person that are attributable to such General Restructuring Step, any costs
associated with amending this Agreement to provide for such General
Restructuring Step and any costs of implementing such General Restructuring
Step) (it being understood that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this clause (C), Seller will bear a reasonable level of legal costs in

 

 26    
  
 

 connection with the good faith consideration contemplated by this Section
2.07(d)) and (D) no such General Restructuring Step shall impede or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  Section 2.08 _. Withholding; Gross-up._ (a) Buyer shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to the holders
of the Class A Shares, the Class B Shares and the In-the-Money Company Options
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. Except as set forth in
Sections 2.08(b) and (c), to the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld by Buyer and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such
deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Class A Shares, the Class B
Shares or the In-the-Money Company Options, as the case may be, in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made by Buyer.

 

  (b) If Buyer or the Company shall be entitled by law to deduct or
withhold any amount under subsection 116(5) of the Canadian Tax Act in respect
of the Class A Purchase Price, (i) Buyer (on behalf of itself or the Company,
as applicable), shall make such deductions or withholdings (including
deductions and withholdings applicable to such additional sums payable under
this Section 2.08(b)), (ii) Buyer shall pay additional amounts to Seller
so that the net amount received by Seller, after provision for such
deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable
to any such additional sums payable under this Section 2.08(b)) and any Taxes
payable upon receipt of any such additional sums payable under this Section
2.08(b), is equal to the amount Buyer would have received had no such

otherwise payable to such Class B Holder shall be increased as necessary so

deductions and withholdings (including deductions and withholdings applicable
to any such additional sums payable under this Section 2.08(c)) and any Taxes
payable upon receipt of any

 

 27    
  
 

 such additional sums payable under this Section 2.08(c), is equal to the

has all organizational powers to carry on its business as now conducted. The
Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in

  Section 3.04 _. Noncontravention._ The execution, delivery and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the

  Section 3.07 _. Subsidiaries._ (a) Each Subsidiary of the Company is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and, with respect to jurisdictions

 30    
  
 

 statements of income and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005
and December 31, 2004 and the unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet as
of September 30, 2006 and the related unaudited interim
consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the nine months ended
September 30, 2006 of the Company Entities (collectively, the "Financial
Statements"). The Financial Statements fairly present in all material
respects in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto), the consolidated financial position of the
Company Entities as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to normal year-
end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial statements).

 

  (b) The Company Entities maintain in all material respects internal
controls over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, all other accounting
standards applicable to the Company Entities in each jurisdiction in which the
relevant Company Entities operate, and all Applicable Laws.

Entity.

 

  Section 3.09 _. Absence of Certain Changes._ Since the Balance Sheet
Date through the date of this Agreement, the business of the Company Entities
has been conducted in the ordinary course consistent with past practices and
there has not been any action taken by any Company Entity that, if taken
during the period from the date of this Agreement through Closing without
Buyers consent, would constitute a breach of Section 5.01. Since December

individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

  Section 3.10 _. No Undisclosed Material Liabilities._ There are no

Private Fund and each other Client (other than natural persons and investment
vehicles of natural persons that invest through separately managed accounts
opened through a broker-dealer or other financial institution). Each Sponsored
U.S. Public Fund is, and at all times required under Applicable Law has been,
duly registered with the SEC as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. Each Sponsored Public Fund is, and at all times required under
Applicable Law has been, duly registered as a pooled investment vehicle with
such Governmental Authorities as are required under Applicable Law, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be
material. No Sponsored Private Fund is required to register as an investment
company under the Investment Company Act.

 

  (b) Each Sponsored Fund is duly organized, validly existing and, with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of "good standing," in
good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has
the requisite corporate, trust, company or partnership power and authority to
own its properties and to carry on its business conducted as of the date of
this Agreement, and is qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where it
is required to be so qualified under Applicable Law, except where failure to
be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material.

 

  (c) The shares or units of each Sponsored Public Fund (i) have been
issued and sold by such Sponsored Public Fund in compliance in all material
respects with Applicable Law, (ii) are and were qualified in all material
respects

 

 38    
  
 

 for public offering and sale by such Sponsored Public Fund in each
jurisdiction where offers are made to the extent required under Applicable Law
and (iii) have been duly authorized and validly issued in all material
respects and are fully paid and non-assessable.

 

  (d) All outstanding shares or interests of each Sponsored Private Fund
have been issued and sold by such Sponsored Private Funds in compliance in all
material respects with Applicable Law.

 

  (e) Each Sponsored Public Fund has all material permits, licenses,
certificates of authority, orders and approvals of, and has made all material
filings, applications and registrations with, Governmental Authorities that
are required by Applicable Law in order to permit it to carry on its
respective business as presently conducted, and such material permits,
licenses, certificates of authority, registrations, orders and approvals are
in full force and effect.

 

  (f) Each Sponsored Fund is in compliance in all material respects with
all Applicable Law. The registration statement of each Sponsored U.S. Public
Fund under the Investment Company Act and/or the Securities Act has, at all
times when such registration statement was effective since January 1, 2004,
complied in all material respects with the requirements of the Investment
Company Act and the Securities Act then in effect and neither
such registration statement nor any amendments thereto contained, at any time
when such registration statement was in use since January 1, 2004, an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except in
each case as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material. Neither the private placement memorandum of each
Sponsored Private Fund nor any amendments thereto contained, at the time such
private placement memorandum or, as applicable, any amendment, was in use
since January 1, 2004, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, except in each case as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material.

 

  (g) Each Sponsored Fund has filed all material registrations, reports,
prospectuses, proxy statements, statements of additional information,
financial statements, statements, notices and other material filings required
to be filed by it within the past two years with any Governmental Authority,
including all material amendments or supplements to any of the above, in each
case to the extent related to its business (the "Fund Filings"). The Fund
Filings complied in all material respects with the requirements of Applicable
Law. To the knowledge of Seller, the information contained in the
Fund Filings does not contain any untrue

 

 39    
  
 

 statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make any material statement made
therein, in light of the circumstances, not misleading. The
financial statements, including, without limitation, the statement of assets
and liabilities, the statement of operations and the statement of changes in
net assets, and the notes thereto set forth in any such Fund Filings or sent
to any investor fairly present, in all material respects, the financial
position of each Sponsored Fund as at the dates of such statements and the
results of its operations for the periods covered thereby in accordance with
GAAP consistently applied (except as noted therein). Since the end of the
period covered by any such Fund Filing and except as addressed by another Fund
Filing, there has occurred no event or condition which would (i) require any
Sponsored Fund to file an additional Fund Filing (other than a Fund Filing of
the type required to be filed periodically in the ordinary course) or (ii)
require any Sponsored Fund to conduct a meeting of its shareholders (other
than a meeting held or to be held in the ordinary course of such Fund), in
each case other than with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

  (h) No Company Entity or any person who is an "affiliated person" (as
defined in the Investment Company Act) or, to the knowledge of Seller, an
"interested person" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) of any Company
Entity, receives or is entitled to receive any compensation directly or
indirectly (i) from any person in connection with the purchase or sale of
securities or other property to, from or on behalf of a U.S. Public Fund or
(ii) from any U.S. Public Fund or its security holders, except, in any such
case, in material compliance with Applicable Law (including Section 17(e) of
the Investment Company Act and the regulations thereunder). The
respective Company Entities and Sponsored U.S. Public Funds are in material
compliance with Applicable Law regulating such compensation arrangements,
including disclosure thereof.

 

  (i) As to each U.S. Public Fund, there has been in full force and
effect an investment advisory agreement between such Fund and a Company Entity
at all times when a Company Entity has acted as an investment adviser to such
Fund, except in each case as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material. Each agreement pursuant to which any
Company Entity has, since January 1, 2004, received compensation respecting
its activities in connection with each U.S. Public Fund was duly approved and
has been duly renewed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Investment Company Act, except in each case as would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material. Each Company Entity
providing Investment Advisory Services to a U.S. Public Fund under an
investment advisory agreement is not in material breach of such agreement. As
to each Sponsored U.S. Public Fund that pays fees under Rule 12b-1 under the
Investment Company Act, there has been in full force and effect a Rule 12b-1
Plan authorizing such payment at all times since the commencement of payment
of such fees, except in each case as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected

 

40    
  
 

 to be material. Each Rule 12b-1 Plan pursuant to which any Sponsored U.S.
Public Fund pays fees was duly approved and has been duly renewed in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and
rules thereunder, except in each case as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material. All 12b-1 fees paid by a
Sponsored U.S. Public Fund are in accordance with the applicable Rule 12b-1
Plan, except in each case as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material. The proceeds of all 12b-1 fees paid by
a U.S. Public Fund and used by a Company Entity have been used by such Company
Entity for a proper purpose in accordance with Applicable Law and the terms
of the applicable Rule 12b-1 Plan, except in each case as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material.

 

  (j) There are no material consent judgments or orders of a Governmental
Authority or judicial orders on or with regard to any Sponsored Fund currently
in effect.

 

  (k) Since January 1, 2004, (i) each Sponsored Fund has been operated in
compliance with its respective investment objectives, investment policies and
offering document descriptions in all material respects, (ii) any Company
Entity that has provided Investment Advisory Services to any Fund that is not
a Sponsored Fund has done so in compliance in all material respects with its
respective investment objectives, investment policies and offering document
descriptions from time to time provided to the Company Entities by the sponsor
of such Fund, and (iii) any Company Entity that has provided Investment
Advisory Services to any Client that is not a Fund has done so in compliance
in all material respects with such Clients Investment Advisory Agreement
with the Company Entities.

 

  (l) (i) (A) All material federal, state, foreign and other material Tax
returns, dividend reporting forms and other Tax-related reports of the
Sponsored Funds required by Applicable Law to have been filed by the Closing
Date shall have been filed in a timely manner and are or will be correct in
all material respects, (B) all material Taxes shown as due or required to be
shown as due on such returns, forms and reports, or any other Taxes due, and
any interest and/or penalties, shall have been paid or provision shall have
been made for the payment thereof, (C) none of the Sponsored Funds is under
audit and no assessment for Taxes or other amounts has been proposed or
asserted with respect to any of the Sponsored Funds, and (D) provision has
been or will be made for any material Taxes, or interest or penalties, for
which returns and/or payments are not due on or before the Closing Date.

Clients for which it provides services, including but not limited to,
qualified retirement plans, college savings plans, and individual retirement
arrangements, (B) the collection and maintenance of all applicable withholding

  Section 3.16 _. Variable Product Parties._ (a) Schedule 3.16(a) sets
forth a complete and correct list, as of the date of this Agreement, of each
Variable Product Party with which a Company Entity has any participation
arrangement or agreement.

 

  (b) Schedule 3.16(b) sets forth a complete and correct list, as of the
date of this Agreement, of all variable products for which the Putnam Variable
Trust is the sole underlying fund investment option, together with the amount
of assets of the Putnam Variable Trust outstanding under each such product as
of the Base Date.

 

  Section 3.17 _. Properties._ The Company Entities do not own any real
property. The applicable Company Entity has (and immediately after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will have) good and
valid title to, or in the case of leased property and assets has (and
immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
will have) good and valid leasehold interests in, or otherwise has (and
immediately after the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
will have) full and sufficient and legally enforceable rights to use all
properties and assets (whether real, personal, tangible or intangible) used
or held for use in connection with, necessary for the conduct of, or otherwise
material to, the business of the Company Entities except for properties and
assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business or as permitted by this
Agreement or where the failure to have such good and valid title, valid
leasehold interests or other rights would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material. None of such property or
assets is subject to any Lien, other than Permitted Liens. Each Company
Entity has maintained all tangible property or assets in good repair, working
order and operating condition subject only to ordinary wear and tear.

 

  Section 3.18 _. Tax Representations._ (a) (i) All Tax returns,
statements, reports and forms (collectively, the "Company Returns") that are
material and required to be filed with any Taxing Authority on or before the
Closing Date with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period by, or with respect
to, any Company Entity have been, or will be, timely filed on or before the
Closing Date; (ii) the Company

 

 43    
  
 

 Entities have timely paid all Taxes shown as due and payable on the Company
Returns that have been filed; (iii) the Company Returns that have been filed
are true, correct and complete in all material respects; (iv) the
charges, accruals and reserves for Taxes with respect to the Company Entities
reflected on the books of the Company Entities are adequate to cover material
Tax liabilities accruing through the end of the last period for which the
Company Entities ordinarily record items on their respective books; and (v)
there is no action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit or claim now
proposed or pending against or with respect to any Company Entity in respect
of any material Tax.

 

  (b) None of the Company Entities has waived any statute of limitations
applicable to any Tax return, which period (after giving effect to such
extension or waiver) has not yet expired. There are no Liens for Taxes (other
than Taxes not yet due and payable) upon any assets of any Company Entity.
Each Company Entity has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have
been withheld and paid in connection with any amounts paid or owing to any
employee, independent contractor, creditor, stockholder, or other third party.
Seller has delivered or made available to Buyer correct and complete copies of
all Federal, state and foreign income Tax returns (prepared on a pro forma
basis in the case of consolidated, combined or unitary Tax returns) filed by
the Company Entities with respect to taxable periods beginning after December
31, 2002 and copies of all examination reports received with respect to any
Company Entity with respect to any taxable period beginning after December
31, 2002. No claim has ever been made by a Governmental Authority in a
jurisdiction where a Company Entity does not file Tax returns that such
Company Entity is or may be subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. None of
the Company Entities will be required to include any material item of income
in, or exclude an item of deduction from, taxable income for any taxable
period (or portion thereof) ending after the Closing Date as a result of
any (A) change in method of accounting for a taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date; (B) closing agreement or similar agreement with
respect to Taxes executed prior to the Closing; (C) installment sale or open
transaction disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date; or (D) prepaid
amount received on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

  (c) From January 1, 2007 to the date hereof, (i) the Company has not
received dividends or other income distributions from Putnam, LLC or any other
Company Entity and Putnam, LLC has not redeemed, acquired or cancelled any of
the limited liability company interests in it held by the Company, and (ii)
the Company has not directly received any interest, rent, royalties or
management fees. This representation and warranty will not survive
the Closing if a Finance Comfort Letter or CRA Tax Ruling is obtained prior
to the Closing Date.

 

  (d) As of the date hereof, Seller is a resident of the United States
for the purposes of the Canada-United States Income Tax Convention (1980), as

 

 44    
  
 

 amended, and, as such, is entitled under current law to all the benefits
provided therein for a resident of the United States.

 

  Section 3.19 _. Intellectual Property._ (a) Schedule 3.19(a) sets forth
a complete and correct list of (i) all registrations and applications for
registration included in the Company Intellectual Property Rights, specifying,
as to each such item, as applicable, the jurisdiction and number of each such
application and/or registration and (ii) all material software applications
included in the Company Intellectual Property Rights. Schedule 3.19(a)(iii)
sets forth a list of certain material unregistered trademarks used in the
conduct of the business of the Company Entities as currently conducted.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller makes no
representations whatsoever as to the completeness of Schedule 3.19(a)(iii) .

 

  (b) Schedule 3.19(b) sets forth a complete and correct list of all
material agreements under which a Company Entity (i) uses or has the right to
use any Intellectual Property Rights owned by a third party (other than
agreements for commercially-available software that are subject to "shrink
wrap" or other similar user licenses) or (ii) has licensed or sublicensed to
others the right to use any Company Intellectual Property Rights (other than
(x) non-exclusive end user licenses granted to the Companys customers in the
normal course of business, (y) non-exclusive limited use trademark licenses
granted to the Company Entities clients, distributors or strategic partners
in the ordinary course of business, or (z) any non-disclosure agreements
entered into in the normal course of business).

 

  (c) The Company Entities have exclusive right, title and interest in
and to all Company Intellectual Property Rights free and clear of any Lien. To
the knowledge of Seller, the Company Intellectual Property Rights and the
Licensed Intellectual Property Rights together constitute all the Intellectual
Property Rights necessary to or otherwise used in the conduct of the business
of the Company Entities as currently conducted. The registrations of all
material Company Intellectual Property Rights set forth on Schedule 3.19(a)
are held and/or recorded in the applicable Company Entitys name, are validly
registered, legally enforceable and in full force, and are not subject to
any cancellation or reexamination proceeding. Each agreement set forth on
Schedule 3.19(b) is a valid and binding agreement of the applicable Company
Entity and, to the knowledge of Seller, of any other party thereto,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, and no Company Entity or, to the
knowledge of Seller, any other party thereto is in default or breach in any
respect under the terms of any such agreement, except for any such defaults or
breaches which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material.

 

  (d) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material, the conduct of the business of the Company
Entities as currently conducted does not infringe upon, misappropriate,
violate or conflict in

 

 45    
  
 

 any material way with the Intellectual Property Rights of any other third
party Person (other than with respect to Patent rights). To the knowledge of
Seller, the conduct of the business of the Company Entities as
currently conducted does not infringe upon, misappropriate, violate or
conflict in any material way with the Patent rights of any other third party
Person. Since January 1, 2004: (i) the Company Entities have not received any
notice alleging that any Company Intellectual Property Rights are invalid or
unenforceable or challenging the Company Entities ownership of the Company
Intellectual Property Rights or asserting that the Company Entities are
infringing or misappropriating the Intellectual Property Rights of any third
party Person; and (ii) there is and has been no action, suit or proceeding
pending, or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened, against any Company
Entity (A) challenging or seeking to deny or restrict the rights of
any Company Entity in any Company Intellectual Property Right or Licensed
Intellectual Property Right, or (B) alleging that any Company Entity has
infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Intellectual Property
Right of any third party. No Company Intellectual Property Right is subject
to any material outstanding judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement
restricting the use thereof by any Company Entity or restricting the licensing
thereof by any Company Entity to any Person;  _provided_ that the foregoing
representation shall be limited to the knowledge of Seller as relates to any
judgment, injunction, order, decree or agreement, as applicable, to which a
Company Entity is not a party.

 

  (e) To the knowledge of Seller, no third party is infringing or
otherwise violating any Company Intellectual Property Rights in a manner that
would materially adversely affect such Company Intellectual Property Rights,
and, since January 1, 2004, no Company Entity has sent any notice to or
asserted or threatened any action or claim against any Person involving or
relating to any alleged material violation of any Company
Intellectual Property Rights. The Company Entities have taken all reasonable
and appropriate steps in accordance with normal industry practice (i) to
protect and maintain all material Intellectual Property Rights used or held
for use by the Company Entities in the conduct of the business of the Company
Entities as currently conducted and (ii) to preserve the confidentiality of
any Company Intellectual Property, the value of which is dependent upon
maintaining the confidential nature thereof.

 

  (f) The Company Entities have in place and practice a policy by which
any Company Intellectual Property Rights developed in whole or in part by any
employee of the Company Entities in the course of his or her employment are
owned by the Company Entities. The Company Entities take commercially
reasonable steps, in accordance with normal industry practice, to have each
outside consultant, who is or has been involved in the development of
any Company Intellectual Property Rights, enter into an appropriate agreement
assigning or granting the right to use to a Company Entity all rights to any

 

 46    
  
 

 Intellectual Property Rights developed on behalf of such Company Entity by
such outside consultant in the course of his or her employment.

 

  (g) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material, the Company Entities practices regarding the
collection, dissemination and use of personal customer information in
connection with the business or operations of the business or assets are and
have been in accordance in all material respects with any applicable
contractual agreements with customers or applicable privacy policies
published by the Company Entities or otherwise communicated by, and in a
manner binding upon, the Company Entities to their respective customers.

 

  (h) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material, no material Company Intellectual Property Rights
developed by or on behalf of the Company Entities, and, to the knowledge of
Seller, no material Company Intellectual Property Rights acquired from third
parties, were developed in whole or in part (i) pursuant to, or in connection
with, the development of any professional, technical or industry standard,
(ii) under contract with any government authority, (iii) using any government
funding, or funding of a university, college or other educational institution
or research center or (iv) to the knowledge of Seller, incorporating any
software, software development toolkits, databases, libraries, scripts, or
other, similar modules of software that are subject to "open source" or
similar license terms, including but not limited to the GNU General Public
License and the GNU Limited General Public License and that would subject the
Company Entities to any obligation, in favor of any third party, for the
Company Entities to disclose or distribute any such Company Intellectual
Property Rights in source code form, to license any such Company Intellectual
Property Rights for the purpose of making derivative works, or to distribute
any such Company Intellectual Property Rights without charge.

 

  Section 3.20 _. Insurance Coverage._ Seller has made available to Buyer
a list of all material insurance policies and fidelity bonds relating to the
assets, business, operations, employees, officers or directors of the Company
Entities, each of which is listed on Schedule 3.20 and which is effective as
of the date of this Agreement. Such insurance policies are in full force and
effect and such policies (or replacement policies of substantially the same
character and coverage) will continue in force to the Closing Date. As of the
date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding written notices of
cancellation of any material insurance policy maintained in favor of a
Company Entity (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, statutory notices of
expiration and other such notices given in accordance with Applicable Law). As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no material claims by the Company
Entities pending under any of such policies or bonds as to which coverage has
been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such

 

 47    
  
 

 policies or bonds or in respect of which such underwriters have reserved
their rights.

 

  Section 3.21 _. Employee Benefit Plans._ (a) Schedule 3.21(a) contains
a list of all material Employee Plans. The Company has made available
to Buyer copies of each material Employee Plan (and, if applicable, related
trust or funding agreements or insurance policies), and all amendments thereto
and written interpretations thereof have been furnished to Buyer together with
the most recent annual report (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B
thereto) and Form 990, if applicable, prepared in connection with any such
plan or trust.

 

  (b) None of the Company, any ERISA Affiliate and any predecessor
thereof sponsors, maintains, contributes to, or has in the past six years
sponsored, maintained, contributed to or incurred any liability to any (i)
employee benefit plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Part 3, Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA, (ii) multiemployer plan, as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA, (iii) funded welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 419
of the Code, or (iv) any Employee Plan that is now or at any time has been a
plan or arrangement that has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of
whom are not under common control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of
ERISA.

 

  (c) Each Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter, or has
pending or has time remaining in which to file, an application for such
determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and neither Seller nor the
Company is aware of any reason why any such determination letter should be
revoked or not be reissued. The Company has made available to Buyer copies
of the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letters with
respect to each such Employee Plan. Each Employee Plan has been maintained in
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes, orders, rules and regulations, including ERISA and the Code, which
are applicable to such Employee Plan, except as would not be material. No
events have occurred with respect to any Employee Plan that could result in
payment or assessment by or against any Company Entity of any material
charges or taxes including excise taxes under Sections 4972, 4976, 4977, 4979,
4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code, if applicable, except as would not be
material.

 

  (d) No Employee Plan provides death or medical benefits, beyond
termination of service or retirement other than (i) coverage mandated by
Applicable Law or (ii) death or retirement benefits under an Employee Plan
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither any Company Entity nor any
ERISA Affiliate has made a written or oral representation to any current or
former employee promising or guaranteeing any employer paid continuation
of medical, dental, life or disability coverage for any period of time beyond
retirement or termination of employment.

 

 48    
  
 

  (e) No Employee Plan exists that, as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in connection with other
events), would result in the payment, individually or in the aggregate of a
material nature, to any current or former employee, director or independent
contractor of any Company Entity of any money or other property or could
result in the acceleration or provision of any other rights or benefits,
individually or in the aggregate of a material nature, to any current or
former employee, director or independent contractor of any Company Entity.

 

  (f) Since the Balance Sheet Date, no Company Entity has effectuated (i)
a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of
employment or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of
employment or facility of any Company Entity, (ii) a "mass layoff" (as defined
in the WARN Act) or (iii) such other transaction, layoff, reduction in force
or employment terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of any
similar state or local law which would be material.

 

  (g) Each Company Entity and each ERISA Affiliate has complied in all
material respects with the notice and continuation coverage requirements of
section 4980B of the Code and the regulations thereunder with respect to each
Employee Plan that is a group health plan within the meaning of section
5000(b)(1) of the Code. Each Employee Plan is in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable provisions of the Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") and the regulations issued
thereunder.

 

  (h) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13, with respect to each Employee
Plan, except as would not be material (i) there are no pending audits or
investigations by any Governmental Authority, no termination proceedings, and
no pending or, to the knowledge of Seller, any Company Entity or any ERISA
Affiliate, (A) threatened claims (except for individual claims for benefits

the business of Seller or the Company Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(A) Buyer shall not have access to personnel records of the Company Entities
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories
or other information which in Sellers good faith opinion could subject Seller
or any Company Entity to risk of liability and (B) neither Seller nor any
Company Entity shall be obligated to provide access to, or to disclose, any

shall be directed to an executive

 

 56    
  
 

 officer of Seller or such Person as may be designated by Sellers executive
officers.

extent necessary (i) to permit Buyer to determine any matter relating to its
rights and obligations hereunder or (ii) in connection with any insurance
claim, or legal, administrative or other proceeding by any Governmental
Authority, arising out of any Company Entitys business and operations in
which Buyer or any of its Affiliates may from time to time be involved (but
in each case only to the extent such books and records are required to be
retained under Applicable Law) (other than with respect to disputes between
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand); _provided_ (i) that
any such access by Buyer shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of
the business of Seller or its Affiliates and (ii) neither Seller nor any
of its controlled Affiliates shall be obligated to provide access to, or to
disclose, any information to Buyer if Seller or such Affiliate reasonably
determines that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of Seller or such Affiliate or violate any Applicable Law or
contractual confidentiality obligations.

 

  Section 5.03 _. Notices of Certain Events._ Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer of:

 

  (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

  (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
or, to its knowledge, threatened, relating to Seller or any Company Entity

required to have been disclosed pursuant to Sections 3.13, 3.14, 3.18,
3.19(c), 3.19(d), 3.19(e), 3.21 and 3.22, as the case may be, or that would
reasonably be expected to prohibit or impair the ability of Seller
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

  (d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be expected
to cause the condition set forth in Section 10.02(b) not to be satisfied; and

 

 57    
  
 

  (e) any failure of Seller to comply in any material respect with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder;

 

  _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.03
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to Buyer.

 

  Section 5.04 _. Non-Compete; Non-Solicitation._ (a) As a separate and
independent covenant, Seller agrees that, without the consent of Buyer:

 

>  
>
> (i) for a period of three years after the Closing Date, it shall not,
> and it shall cause its controlled Affiliates not to:
>
>  
>

>>  

>>

>> (A) directly or indirectly acquire 20% or more of the equity
securities in, or acquire (whether by ownership of voting securities, contract
or otherwise) the power to elect a majority of the board of  directors or
other persons performing similar functions of, a Competing Business;
_provided_ that nothing herein shall prohibit the direct or indirect
acquisition by Seller or any of its  controlled Affiliates of any interest
(whether by ownership of voting securities, contract or otherwise) in a Person
having not more than 20% of its revenues (based on its most recent annual
financial statements) attributable to a Competing  Business; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in the event of an acquisition contemplated by the
immediately preceding proviso during the three  year period from the Closing
Date, (i) Seller shall, within two years of such acquisition, enter into a
definitive agreement to divest such Competing Business (or portion thereof
such that it no longer constitutes a Competing Business), it being 
understood that if any such definitive agreement is thereafter terminated
prior to consummation of the divestiture, Seller shall effect such divestiture
as promptly as reasonably practicable, and (ii) the duration of the non-
solicitation covenant  set forth in clause (B) below shall be extended so
that it remains in effect for at least one year following such acquisition; or

>>

>>

Company Entity to leave the employment of such Company Entity; _provided_ that
the use of (1) general, non-targeted employment advertising or (2) an
independent search firm that contacts any such Person without direction or
advice by Seller or its controlled Affiliates, shall be deemed to be not in
violation  of this Section; and

 58    
  
 

>  
>
> (ii) for a period of five years after the Closing Date, it shall cause

  "Competing Business" means an asset management business which has in
excess of $20 billion of assets under management invested in publicly traded
securities through any combination of the following investment advisory
products: (i) retail mutual funds, (ii) institutional separate accounts and
(iii) institutional collective funds maintained by a bank or a trust company.
For the avoidance of doubt, a multi-manager or a fund-of-funds business shall
not constitute a Competing Business, and any assets under management through
multi-manager or fund-of-funds products shall be disregarded in determining
whether an asset management business constitutes a Competing Business.

 

  "Specified MHRS DC Client" means an institutional defined contribution
plan client, a Midmarket Client (as such term is defined in the DC Plan
Services Agreement) or a Taft-Hartley Client (as such term is defined in the
DC Plan Services Agreement) of Mercer HR Services which (i) includes Company
mutual funds on the list of mutual funds that are made available for
investment by its plan participants and (ii) was a client of Mercer HR
Services as of the Closing Date.

 

  (b) Seller acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of its
obligations under this Section 5.04 would cause Buyer and its Affiliates
irreparable injury and that monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy;
therefore Buyer shall have the right to an injunction or other equitable
relief in any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining such breach or
threatened breach. The existence and exercise of this right shall not preclude
any other rights and remedies Buyer may have at law, in equity or otherwise.

 

  Section 5.05 _. Directors and Officers; Other Relationships._ At the
Closing, Seller shall cause to be delivered to Buyer duly signed resignations
and terminations, as appropriate, effective immediately after the Closing, of
(i) unless otherwise requested by Buyer, any directors or officers of the
Company Entities who are directors or officers of Seller or its
controlled Affiliates or (ii) any other controlled Affiliates of Seller who
serve as a general partner, or in a similar capacity for any Company Entity.

 

 59    
  
 

  Section 5.06 _. Arrangements with respect to Transitional Services and
Shared Facility._ Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith definitive
agreements to be entered into between the Company and Seller (or appropriate
Affiliates thereof), effective as of the Closing, with respect to (i)
transitional services substantially on the terms set forth on the term sheet
attached as Exhibit B hereto and (ii) the lease assignment and sublease with
respect to the leased premises described in Exhibit C hereto, substantially on
the terms set forth in the term sheet attached as Exhibit C hereto, and in
each case containing such other terms as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree.

 

  Section 5.07 _. Certain Assets._ (a) At or around Closing, Seller shall
make a written statement to (i) the ERISA investment fiduciary for The Marsh
and McLennan Companies Retirement Plan, The Marsh and McLennan Companies Stock
Investment Plan and The Mercer HR Services Retirement Plan and (ii) the plan
trustees of the three U.K. tax-qualified defined benefit retirement
plans maintained by Seller for the benefit of its eligible employees employed
in the U.K., regarding the positive aspects of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement with respect to the Company Entities and the Company mutual
funds that are available for investment through such plans, and shall
recommend to such ERISA investment fiduciary and plan trustees that they view
such transactions positively with respect to the Company Entities and such
Company mutual funds. Seller shall provide Buyer with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such statement and recommendation. In
addition, during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall not take any position, in
its dealings, as the corporate sponsor of such plans, with such ERISA
investment fiduciary and plan trustees with respect to the availability of the
Company mutual funds for investment through such plans or whether the plan
assets that are managed by the Company in such plans as of the Closing Date
should continue to be managed by the Company; _provided_ that, for the
avoidance of doubt, Buyer understands and agrees that Mercer Investment
Consulting provides investment advice to the ERISA investment fiduciary and
plan trustees in the ordinary course and will not be bound in any way by this
provision when providing such advice. Buyer understands that Seller is
not authorized to bind any ERISA investment fiduciaries, the UK trustees or
such fiduciaries or trustees delegates, and in particular that such persons
are obligated to carry out their duties consistent with the requirements of
ERISA, the Code and Applicable Law.

 

  (b) Seller agrees that for the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, it shall continue to make
money market mutual funds managed by the Company available for the investment
of Sellers corporate excess cash in connection with Sellers cash management
activities in the ordinary course consistent with past practices.

 

 60    
  
 

  (c) Without limiting the obligations of Buyer and Seller under Section
7.06, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith, with a view to entering
into prior to Closing, modifications to certain provisions of the Defined
Contribution Plan Services Standards Marketing and Agency Services Agreement
dated December 31, 2004 among Putnam Fiduciary Trust Company, Putnam Retail
Management Limited Partnership, Mercer Trust Company and Mercer
HR Outsourcing, LLC (the "DC Plan Services Agreement") relating to
administrative matters ( _e.g._ , with respect to time periods for notices
and termination, service level details, access provisions, maintenance of
records), to incorporate commercially standard and customary terms for such
type of agreements entered into by unaffiliated third parties; _provided_ that
no such modification shall modify the material commercial terms of the DC Plan
Services Agreement (including the fees payable to Mercer HR Services by the
Company Entities thereunder as set forth on Exhibit E thereto, and other
economic terms). In addition, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith
further modifications to the DC Plan Services Agreement with a view to
establishing a mutually satisfactory long-term and sustainable relationship
between Mercer HR Services and the Company with respect to the matters covered
by the DC Plan Services Agreement (it being understood that the parties shall
be under no obligation to agree to any such modifications).

 

  (d) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the
fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall cause Mercer Investment
Consulting not to initiate a program of systematic solicitation of the
Specified MHRS DC Clients (who remain clients of Mercer HR Services at the
time of solicitation and who were not clients of Mercer Investment Consulting
as of the Closing Date) with respect to the provision of
investment consulting services for defined contribution plans; _provided_
that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing is intended to prohibit such a
program of systematic solicitation only, and shall not otherwise be construed
as precluding Mercer Investment Consulting from providing investment
consulting services to any such clients.

 

  (e) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December
31, 2009 (or, if Seller and Buyer agree to extend the DC Plan Services
Agreement on mutually satisfactory customary and market terms, ending on the
fifth anniversary of the Closing Date), in recognition of the shared interest
that the parties have in the ongoing success of Mercer HR Services defined
contribution plan business and in retaining Company mutual funds on the
defined contribution plan platforms of the Companys clients, Seller shall
cause Mercer HR Services not to recommend, without reasonable cause, that any

dated as of September 30, 2006, between Buyer and Seller, on behalf of the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), all "Evaluation Material"
(as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), including, to the extent
constituting "Evaluation Material", all documents and information concerning
Seller and its Affiliates,  including the Company Entities (including

furnished to, or prepared by, Buyer, its Affiliates or any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors and agents and other representatives in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

  Section 6.02 _. Access and Cooperation._ (a) Buyer shall, and shall
cause its controlled Affiliates and each Company Entity to, on and after the
Closing Date, to use reasonable best efforts to afford to Seller and its
Affiliates and their respective counsel, financial advisors, auditors and
other designated representatives (subject to confidentiality commitments to
Buyer and its Affiliates) reasonable access to their books and records to the
extent necessary (i) to permit Seller to determine any matter relating to its
rights and obligations hereunder, (ii) in connection with any other insurance
claim, or legal, administrative or other proceeding, arising out of any
Company Entitys business and operations in which Seller or any of its
Affiliates may from time to time be involved (but in each case only to the
extent such books and records are required to be retained under Applicable
Law) (other than with respect to proceedings involving disputes between Buyer,
on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand) or (iii) in connection with
the preparation of any reports filed or furnished by Seller pursuant to the
1934 Act, including any financial statements or schedules included or
incorporated by reference therein; _provided_ that any such access by Seller
shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Buyer or
the Company Entities.

 

  (b) Buyer shall cause each Company Entity, on and after the Closing
Date, to afford promptly to Seller and its Affiliates and their respective
counsel, financial advisors, auditors and other designated representatives
reasonable access to and/or copies of (or, if necessary, originals of) their

understood that Buyer will cause the Company Entities to execute all
complaints and other court or similar papers reasonably requested in order to

 

 63    
  
 

 assist Seller and its Affiliates in connection with the Retained Matters.
Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall enter into (or cause to be
put in place) reasonable arrangements designed to ensure that the employees
of the Company Entities whose cooperation is required in connection with the
Retained Matters, including those listed on Schedule 6.02(c), are available to
Seller and its Affiliates for purposes of providing the cooperation and
assistance to Seller and its Affiliates as contemplated by this Section
6.02(c) (provided that such cooperation and assistance shall not interfere
with such employees performance of their duties at the Company Entities
beyond what Seller reasonably believes necessary or appropriate in connection
with the Retained Matters), both during their employment with the Company
Entities and after any termination of employment (including incorporating in
the terms of any separation agreement or other arrangements entered into in
connection with any such termination of employment of any such employee
appropriate terms specifically designed to require such terminated employees
continued cooperation with Seller and its Affiliates after such termination).

 

  (d) From and after the Closing Date, (i) Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Company Entities to, retain all information and records relating to the
Retained Matters until final resolution of the matters to which such
information and records relate and (ii) prior to destroying or disposing of
any such information or records, or other information in the possession of the
Company Entities as of the Closing Date that relate to any action,
suit, investigation or proceeding or any governmental or regulatory
investigation or inquiry (in each case whether pending or threatened) relating
to Seller or its Affiliates, (i) Buyer shall provide not less than 30 days
prior written notice to Seller, specifying the information and records
proposed to be destroyed or disposed of, and (ii) if Seller shall request in
writing prior to the scheduled date for such destruction or disposal that any
of the information and records proposed to be destroyed or disposed of be
delivered to Seller, Buyer shall promptly arrange for the delivery of such of
the information and records as was requested.

 

  (e) Seller shall bear all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
of the Company Entities (excluding general overhead and employee benefits),
upon presentation of invoices therefor, which are reasonably incurred by them
in connection with the provision of information, witnesses or cooperation
pursuant to clauses (b) through (d) above.

 

  Section 6.03 _. Director and Officer Liability._ Buyer shall, and shall
cause the Company to, do the following:

 

  (a) For six years after the Closing, the Company shall indemnify and
hold harmless the present and former officers and directors (or equivalent
members of the governing body of the Company) of the Company and such other
employees of the Company who are covered by the indemnification provisions of

 

 64    
  
 

 the organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
under any Applicable Law, immediately prior to the date of this Agreement
(each a "DandO Indemnified Person") in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Closing to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law
or provided under the Companys organizational documents in effect on the date
of this Agreement.

 

  (b) For six years after the Closing, the Company shall provide
officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing covering each DandO Indemnified Person covered
as of the date of this Agreement by the Companys officers and directors
liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount which,
in all material respects, shall not be less favorable than those of such
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ that if Buyer
instead elects to acquire a six-year "tail" prepaid policy (on terms
with respect to coverage and amount which, in all material respects, shall
not be less favorable than those in effect on the date of this Agreement) at
Closing, Buyer shall not be required to expend more than $7,000,000 for such
policy;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such "tail" policy
exceeds such amount, Buyer shall acquire a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding that amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the parties hereto agree that the insurance coverage that would otherwise be
required to be provided pursuant to this Section may be reduced, after
the Closing, with the prior written approval of Persons representing a
majority of the directors of the Company immediately prior to the Closing who
are still serving at such time.

 

  (c) If Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or the surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section.

 

  (d) Subject to Applicable Law, the rights of each DandO Indemnified
Person under this Section shall be in addition to any rights, including
indemnification rights and rights to advancement of expenses, such person may
have under, and all limitations of liability existing in favor of the DandO
Indemnified Persons as provided in, the organizational documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under any Applicable Law or under any
agreement of any DandO Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The rights in this Section shall survive the Closing in full
force and effect thereafter, without any amendment thereto which is adverse in
any material respect to such DandO Indemnified Person, and are intended to
benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each DandO Indemnified Person. The
obligations of Buyer or the Company under this Section shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner 

 

 65    
  
 

 as to materially adversely affect the rights of any DandO Indemnified Person
under this Section without the consent of such affected DandO Indemnified
Person. Buyer shall cause the Company to perform all of the obligations
of the Company under this Section.

 

  Section 6.04 _. Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act._ (a) Buyer
acknowledges that Seller has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the
benefits and protections provided by Section 15(f) of the Investment Company
Act. Buyer shall not take, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Affiliates not to take, any action that would have the effect, directly
or indirectly, of causing the requirements of any of the provisions of
Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act not to be met in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not fail to take, and,
after the Closing, shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates
not to fail to take, any action if the failure to take such action would have
the effect, directly or indirectly, of causing the requirements of any of the
provisions of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act not to be met in
respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In that regard,
Buyer shall conduct its business and shall, subject to applicable fiduciary
duties in relation to any Public Fund, use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each of its respective Affiliates to conduct its business so as to
assure that:

 

>  
>
> (i) for a period of not less than three years after the Closing, at
> least 75% of the members of the boards of directors or trustees of each U.S.
> Public Fund are not (A) "interested persons"  (within the meaning of
> Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) of the investment adviser of
> such U.S. Public Fund after the Closing or (B) "interested persons" (within
> the meaning of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) of the 
> investment adviser of such U.S. Public Fund immediately prior to the
> Closing; and
>
>  
>
> (ii) for a period of not less than two years after the Closing, there
> shall not be imposed on any U.S. Public Fund an "unfair burden" (for
> purposes of Section 15(f) of the Investment Company  Act) as a result of
> the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any terms, conditions or
> understandings applicable thereto.
>
>  

 

  (b) For a period of three years from the Closing, Buyer shall not
engage, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Affiliates not to
engage, in any transaction that would constitute an "assignment" (as defined
in the Investment Company Act) to a third party of any Investment Advisory
Agreement between Buyer or any of its Affiliates and any U.S. Public Fund
managed or advised by any Company Entity as of the date of this Agreement,
without first obtaining a covenant in all material respects the same as that
contained in this Section. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the covenants of the

 

 66    
  
 

 parties hereto contained in this Section are intended only for the benefit
of such parties and for no other Person.

 

  Section 6.05 _. Notices of Certain Events._ Buyer shall promptly notify
Seller of:

 

  (a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

  (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

  (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
or, to its knowledge, threatened, relating to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries
that, if pending or threatened on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.07 or that would
reasonably be expected to prohibit or materially impair the ability of Buyer
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

  (d) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be expected
to cause the condition set forth in Section 10.03(b) not to be satisfied;

 

  (e) any failure of Buyer to comply in any material respect with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it hereunder; and

 

  (f) to the extent reasonably required for Sellers Tax purposes, any
payments that are made pursuant to the Designated Plans, including the dates
of such payments, the names of the recipients and the amounts that are paid;

 

  _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.05
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
Seller.

Closing, Seller shall settle the net intercompany account between the
Company Entities, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates, on the
other hand, as of the Closing (irrespective of the terms of payment of such
intercompany accounts) in the manner provided in this Section. Immediately
prior to Closing, Seller shall cause the net intercompany account balance
(including amounts relating to intercompany payables and receivables for
Taxes) owing from Seller to the Company (which shall be adjusted to (x) add
any assets and (y) deduct any liabilities, in each case as set forth on the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company Entities immediately prior to
Closing, that relate to the Retained Matters) (as so adjusted, the
"Intercompany Account Settlement Amount"), to be cancelled in consideration of
the redemption of a number of Class A Shares owned by Seller with an aggregate
value (valued at the Per Class A Share Price) equal to the Intercompany
Account Settlement Amount.

 

  (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 7.05(b), all agreements or
arrangements between any Company Entity, on the one hand, and Seller or any of
its controlled Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be terminated as of the
Closing.

 

  Section 7.06 _. Amendment to Defined Contribution Plan Services
Agreement._ Buyer and Seller hereby agree that, concurrently with

Affiliates, if any) to, enter into an amendment to the DC Plan Services
Agreement in the form of Exhibit D hereto.

 TAX MATTERS

 

  Section 8.01 _. Tax Covenants._ (a) (i) Seller agrees to make a timely,
effective and irrevocable election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and
under any comparable statutes in any other jurisdiction with respect to the
Company Entities that are eligible under Applicable Law to make such an
election (other than a Company Entity with respect to which Buyer and Seller
mutually agree in writing after the date hereof not to make a Section
338(h)(10) Election) (the "Section 338(h)(10) Election" and a Company Entity
with respect to which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is to be made, an
"Electing Company Entity"), and to file such election in accordance with
applicable regulations. No later than 90 days following the Closing Date,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer an Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 ("Form
8023") with respect to each Electing Company Entity filled out and executed by
Seller and any of its Affiliates required to execute the Form 8023 and in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, along with any equivalent forms
required under state or local Tax law requested by Buyer and in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer. Buyer shall execute such Forms 8023 and
analogous state or local forms and shall promptly deliver such forms to the
appropriate Internal Revenue Service Center or state or local taxing
authority. Within 30 days after the determination of Closing Stockholders
Equity, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a statement (the "Allocation
Statement") allocating the ADSP (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.338 -4) of the assets of the Electing Company Entities
in accordance with the Treasury regulations promulgated under Section
338(h)(10). Seller shall have the right to review the Allocation Statement. If
within 45 days after receipt of the Allocation Statement, Seller
notifies Buyer in writing that Seller disagrees with the allocation of one or
more items reflected in the Allocation Statement, Buyer and Seller will
negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Buyer and Seller fail to
resolve such dispute within 30 days, the Accounting Referee shall determine
whether the allocation was correct and, if not correct, shall appropriately
revise the Allocation Statement. If Seller does not respond within 45 days, or
upon resolution of the disputed items, the allocation reflected on the
Allocation Statement (as such may have been adjusted) shall be the "Price
Allocation" and shall be binding on the parties hereto. Seller and Buyer
agree to act in accordance with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and the Price
Allocation in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax return (including
the filing of any Internal Revenue Service Form 8883) unless otherwise
required by a change in Applicable Law or a Final Determination.

  (b) Except as expressly provided in Section 8.01(a), Buyer covenants
that it will not cause or permit any Company Entity or any Affiliate of Buyer
(i) to take any action on the Closing Date other than in the ordinary course
of business, including but not limited to the distribution of any dividend or
the effectuation of any redemption that could give rise to any Tax liability
or reduce any Tax asset of the Seller Group or give rise to any loss
of Seller or the Seller Group under this Agreement, or (ii) to make or change
any Tax election, amend any Company Return or take any Tax position on any
Company Return, take any action, omit to take any action or enter into any
transaction, merger or restructuring that results in any increased Tax
liability or reduction of any Tax asset of Seller (other than any of the
foregoing actions taken in the ordinary course in accordance with the past
practice of such Company Entity) or the Seller Group in respect of any Pre-
Closing Tax Period.

 

  (c) Seller shall include the Company Entities in Sellers consolidated
federal Tax return and in any combined state Tax return through the close of
business on the Closing Date. All Tax returns required to be filed after the
Closing Date with respect to any Company Entity (excluding Tax returns filed
by any Company Entity separately from any member of the Seller Group (other
than a Company Entity)) with respect to any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date will be prepared by Seller and filed by Seller when
due (taking into account applicable extensions). All such Tax returns shall,
so far as they relate to a Company Entity, be prepared in accordance with the
past practice and custom of such Company Entity.

 

  (d) (i) All Tax returns of the Company Entities other than those
required to be filed by Seller pursuant to Section 8.01(c) will be filed by
Buyer. No later than 60 days prior to the due date for any Tax return (taking
into account applicable extensions) with respect to a Company Entity that (A)
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (B) is required to be filed by Buyer
pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) (each such Tax return, a "Buyer Straddle
Return"), Buyer shall provide Seller with a draft of such Buyer Straddle
Return. Seller shall provide Buyer with comments, if any, to such Buyer
Straddle Return no later than 30 days following Sellers receipt of the draft
of such Buyer Straddle Return, which comments Buyer shall consider in good
faith in connection with the filing of such Buyer Straddle Return. Buyer and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputed items with
respect to such Buyer Straddle Return within 10 days of Buyers receipt of
Sellers comments. If Buyer and Seller fail to resolve such dispute within 10
days, the appropriate treatment of such items shall be determined by the
Accounting Referee, and such Buyer Straddle Return shall be filed in
accordance with the Accounting Referees determination. No later than five
Business Days prior to the due date of such Tax return (taking into account

 

 75    
  
 

 applicable extensions), Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the portion of the
Taxes related to such Tax return that are allocable to the portion of the
taxable period ending on the Closing Date, but only to the extent that
such amount was not reflected as a liability on the Closing Balance Sheet.
All Buyer Straddle Returns will be filed by Buyer when due in accordance with
applicable laws.

> (ii) The date for the delivery of draft Buyer Straddle Returns from

>  

 

  (e) If Seller notifies Buyer in writing that Seller reasonably believes
that a Company Entity is entitled to receive a Tax refund or credit from a
Taxing Authority with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Seller shall have
the right to pursue such refund, at Sellers expense, and Buyer shall take
such actions, as promptly as reasonably practical, as are reasonably necessary
to cooperate with Seller in making a claim to such Taxing Authority for such
refund or credit, _provided_ that, to the extent that any position taken on
such a refund claim could have an adverse effect on any Company Entity for any
taxable period (or the portion of any taxable period) beginning following the
Closing Date, Sellers right to pursue such refund shall be subject to Buyers
right to consent to the making of such refund claim, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be
paid to Seller all refunds of Taxes and interest thereon received by Buyer,
any Affiliate of Buyer or any Company Entity attributable to Taxes paid by
Seller or any Company Entity (or any predecessor or Affiliate of Seller) with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall have no obligation to make
any payment pursuant to this Section 8.01(e) with respect to any refunds
related to a non-income Taxes to the extent that the amount of such

 

76    
  
 

 refund (plus all other refunds of non-income Taxes) is less than the total
amount of such refunds taken into account on the Closing Balance Sheet.

 

  (f) All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and
other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any
real property transfer Tax and any similar Tax) shall be borne 50% by Buyer
and 50% by Seller and Buyer will, at its own expense, file all necessary
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees, and,
if required by applicable law, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates to,
join in the execution of any such Returns and other documentation.

 

  Section 8.02 _. Tax Sharing._ Any and all existing Tax sharing
agreements between a Company Entity and any Person (including the Tax
Sharing Agreement) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date. After such
date, none of Seller, any Affiliate of Seller and any Company Entity shall
have any further rights or liabilities thereunder. This Agreement shall be the
sole Tax sharing agreement relating to the Company Entities for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods.

 

  Section 8.03 _. Cooperation on Tax Matters._ Buyer and Seller agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and
assistance relating to the Company Entities as is reasonably necessary for the
filing of any return (including any report required pursuant to Section 6043A
of the Code and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder), for the
preparation for any audit, and for the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any proposed adjustment. Buyer and Seller agree
to retain or cause to be retained all books and records pertinent to the
Company Entities until the applicable period for assessment under applicable
law (giving effect to any and all extensions or waivers) has expired, and to
abide by or cause the abidance with all record retention agreements entered
into with any Taxing Authority. Buyer agrees to give Seller reasonable notice
prior to transferring, discarding or destroying any such books and records
relating to Tax matters and, if Seller so requests, Buyer shall allow Seller
to take possession of such books and records. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceedings involving the
Company for any Tax purposes and each shall execute and deliver such powers
of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of
this subsection.

 

  Section 8.04 _. Tax Indemnification by Seller._ (a) Seller shall
indemnify Buyer against and hold it harmless from any (i) Tax of any
Company Entity relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including any income
Taxes incurred by a Company Entity solely by reason of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election), and (ii) liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable
expenses of investigation and attorneys fees and expenses) arising out of or
incident to the imposition,

 

 77    
  
 

 assessment or assertion of any such Tax, including those incurred in the
contest in good faith in appropriate proceedings relating to the imposition,
assessment or assertion of any such Tax, in each case incurred or suffered
by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, the Company
Entities (the sum of (i) and (ii) being referred to as a "Company Tax Loss");
_provided_ that Seller shall have no obligation to make any payment pursuant
to this Section 8.04 in respect of any Company Tax Loss with respect to a non-
income Tax to the extent that the amount of such Company Tax Loss (plus all
other Company Tax Losses in respect of non-income Taxes) is less than the
total amount of Tax liabilities taken into account on the Closing Balance
Sheet. In the case of any taxable period ending after the Closing Date, the
Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case of real
property, personal property and other ad valorem Taxes be determined on a per
diem basis, (ii) in the case of other Taxes imposed under the laws of Canada
or a political subdivision thereof or therein, be determined on the
assumption that this Agreement had not been entered into, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
transaction occurring by reason of a Withholding Restructuring Step or a
General Restructuring Step) had not occurred and any transaction or event
occurring after the completion of any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any transaction occurring
by reason of a Withholding Restructuring Step or a General Restructuring Step)
had not occurred, and (iii) in the case of other Taxes, be determined on the
basis of a closing of the books as of the close of the Closing Date as if
the taxable period ended on the Closing Date.

 

  (b) If Sellers indemnification obligation in respect of such Company
Tax Loss arises in respect of an adjustment which makes allowable to Buyer,
any of its Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, any Company Entity any
deduction, amortization, exclusion from income or other allowance (a "Tax
Benefit") which would not, but for such adjustment, be allowable, then
any payment by Seller to Buyer in respect of such Company Tax Loss shall be
reduced by the amount of any such Tax Benefit actually realized by Buyer, its
Affiliates or such Company Entity, as the case may be (net of any Tax
detriment incurred with respect to the receipt of indemnification payments).

 

  (c) Any payment by Seller pursuant to this Section 8.04 shall be made
not later than 15 days after receipt by Seller of written notice from Buyer
stating that any Company Tax Loss has been paid by Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or, effective upon the Closing, any Company Entity and the amount
thereof and of the indemnity payment requested.

 

  (d) If Buyer becomes aware of any suit, proceeding, audit, claim or
demand for Taxes in respect of which indemnity is, or may reasonably be
expected to be, sought pursuant to this Section 8.04 (a "Tax Proceeding"),
Buyer shall notify Seller of such Tax Proceeding within 10 days of receipt of
written

 

 78    
  
 

 notice thereof, or such earlier time that would allow Seller to timely
respond to such claim or demand ( _provided_ that Buyers inadvertent failure
to give such notice on a timely basis shall relieve Seller of its
indemnification obligation only to the extent that it is actually prejudiced
thereby), and shall give Seller such information with respect thereto as
Seller may reasonably request. Seller may, at its own expense, participate in
and, within 10 days following receipt of written notice of such Tax
Proceeding, upon notice to Buyer, assume the defense of any such Tax
Proceeding. If Seller assumes such defense, Seller shall have the sole
discretion as to the conduct of such defense; _provided_ that (i) Buyer shall
have the right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to
employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by
Seller and (ii) Seller shall not settle such Tax Proceeding without prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the conduct of any
such Tax Proceeding it controls. Whether or not Seller chooses to defend or
prosecute any claim, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof.

 

  (e) Provided that Seller shall have assumed control of the conduct of a
Tax Proceeding pursuant to Section 8.04(d), Seller shall not be liable under
this Section 8.04 for any Tax the payment of which was made without Sellers
prior written consent.

 

  Section 8.05 _. Tax Treatment of Certain Items._ Any amount paid by
Seller or Buyer under Section 2.04, Section 2.06, Article 8 or Article
11 will be treated as an adjustment to the Aggregate Purchase Price for Tax
purposes. Buyer and Seller agree for income Tax purposes that (i) the income
Tax deduction attributable to the Vested Class B Share Closing Payment and the
Vested Class B Option Closing Payment shall be allocable to the taxable year
of the Company ending on the Closing Date, (ii) neither Seller nor any of its
Affiliates (including with respect to the taxable period ending on the Closing
Date, the Company) shall include in ADSP, nor shall Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (including with respect to taxable periods beginning after the
Closing Date, the Company) include in AGUB (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.338 -5), any amount in respect of Buyers
contribution to a Grantor Trust of the Vested Class B Share Trust Payment, the
Unvested Class B Share Trust Payment, the Vested Option Trust Payment or the
Unvested Option Trust Payment (or any payments made thereafter
to beneficiaries of any such Grantor Trust) and (iii) any income Tax
deduction attributable to the Vested Class B Share Trust Payment, the Unvested
Class B Share Trust Payment, the Vested Option Trust Payment and the Unvested
Option Trust Payment shall be allocable to a taxable year of the Company that
begins after the Closing Date. None of Buyer, Seller or any of their
Affiliates shall take any position for Tax purposes inconsistent with this
Section 8.05, unless required by a change in Applicable Law or a Final
Determination to the contrary.

 

 79    
  
 

  Section 8.06 _. Certain Canadian Tax Covenants._ (a) If no Finance
Comfort Letter, CRA Tax Ruling or CRA Comfort Letter is obtained,
Buyer covenants that neither it nor any of its Affiliates will engage in any
transaction or permit any transaction within its control to occur after the
Closing that would cause the NRT Rules to apply in respect of the Company.

 

  (b) If a CRA Tax Ruling is obtained, each party covenants that (i) it
will fulfill, and will cause any person controlled by it after the Closing to
fulfill, all representations or undertakings provided by it or them to the
CRA in connection with the CRA Tax Ruling or contained in the CRA Tax Ruling,
and (ii) it will not take any action, omit to take any action or enter into
any transaction that could cause the CRA Tax Ruling not to apply in full.

 

  (c) If a Finance Comfort Letter, CRA Tax Ruling or CRA Comfort Letter
is obtained, each party will file all Tax returns and other information in a
manner consistent with such Finance Comfort Letter, CRA Tax Ruling or CRA
Comfort Letter, as the case may be.

 

  (d) Seller covenants that it will take commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that, from the date hereof until the Closing, (i) the Company will
not receive dividends or other income distributions from Putnam, LLC or any
other Company Entity and Putnam, LLC will not redeem, acquire or cancel any of
the limited liability company interests in it held by the Company, and (ii)
the Company will not directly receive any interest, rent, royalties
or management fees. Any and all obligations under this covenant shall
terminate upon receipt of a Finance Comfort Letter or CRA Tax Ruling and Buyer
shall have no further rights (including any claim for Damages) with respect to
this covenant after such date.

 

  (e) Buyer agrees to cause the trustees of the Company to designate any
amount payable to Seller or Class B Holders on a redemption of Class A Shares
or Class B Shares or In-the-Money Options, as the case may be, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any transaction occurring by reason of a General
Restructuring Step) as a return of capital and not a distribution of income
of the Company, and otherwise make any permissible designations so that no
part of such amounts are treated as income of the Company payable to Seller or
Class B Holders for any Canadian Tax purposes.

 

  Section 8.07 _. Tax Indemnities._ For the avoidance of doubt, Sellers
obligation to indemnify Buyer with respect to Taxes of the Company Entities
shall be governed by this Article 8 (and not Article 11).

 

 80    
  
 

 ARTICLE 9 
 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

 

  Section 9.01 _. WARN Act._ Seller shall retain full responsibility for
compliance with the WARN Act, and be solely responsible for furnishing any
required notice of any "plant closing" or "mass layoff," as applicable, which
arise as a result of any facility closings, reductions in work force,
terminations or other actions, that the Company Entities may cause
or initiate on or before the Closing Date. At Sellers reasonable request
Buyer will cooperate with Seller as is reasonably necessary to enable Seller
to fulfill its responsibilities under this Section 9.01.

  Section 11.03 _. Procedures._ (a) The party seeking indemnification
under Section 11.02 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to give prompt written
notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the "Indemnifying
Party") of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit,
action or proceeding ("Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought
under such Section and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information
with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall
have materially adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

 

  (b) If any claim or demand by an Indemnified Party under this Article
11 relates to a Claim filed or made against an Indemnified Party by a third
party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnifying Party may elect to control
and appoint lead counsel for the defense of such Third Party Claim (unless the
Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party) at its expense; _provided_ that if the parties to any
Third Party Claim shall include both an Indemnifying Party and an Indemnified
Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by its outside
counsel that there are available different or additional defenses to the
Indemnified Party, the

 

 84    
  
 

 Indemnified Party shall have the right to select separate counsel
(consisting of, with respect to any claim or related claims, one law firm and
one local counsel) and to participate in the defense of such action on its
behalf, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. Subject to the foregoing,
if the Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or defend such Third Party
Claim, it shall within 30 days of the receipt of notice of such Third Party
Claim from the Indemnified Party (or sooner, if the nature of the Claim so
requires) notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If the
Indemnifying Party (i) advises such Indemnified Party in writing that the
Indemnifying Party will not elect to defend, settle or compromise such action
or claim or (ii) fails to make such an election in writing within 30 days of
the receipt of such notice, such Indemnified Party may, at its option, defend,
settle or otherwise compromise or pay such Third Party Claim;  _provided_
that any such settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld. Until the Indemnifying Party makes an election in
accordance with this Section 11.03(b) to defend, settle or compromise such
action, all of the Indemnified Partys reasonable costs and expenses arising
out of the defense, settlement or compromise of any such Third Party Claim
shall be Damages subject to indemnification hereunder to the extent provided
herein.

 

  (c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense
of any Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section
11.03, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before
entering into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does
not release the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with
respect to such Third Party Claim or the settlement imposes injunctive or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party or the settlement
requires an admission of fault or wrongdoing and (ii) the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim and
to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose. The fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Indemnified Party.

 

  (d) Each party shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates
to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim and shall
furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and
attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals,
as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. The party in charge of
the defense shall keep the other parties reasonably apprised at all times as
to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect
thereto.

 

  (e) Each Indemnified Party shall be obligated to use reasonable best
efforts to mitigate Damages upon becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to such Damages. If such Indemnified
Party mitigates its loss after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified
Party

 

 85    
  
 

 under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of that
loss, the Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to the
Indemnifying Party the extent of the actual value of the benefit to
the Indemnified Party of that mitigation (less the Indemnified Partys
reasonable costs of mitigation) within 10 Business Days after the benefit is
received. Each Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best efforts to collect
any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other Person
alleged to be responsible, for any Damages payable under Section 11.02.

 

  (f) _Retained Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Seller shall have sole control of the defense of, and appoint
all counsel in connection with, the Retained Matters, and the other
provisions of this Section 11.03, other than Section 11.03(a) and Section
11.03(e), shall not apply to such Retained Matters, with respect to which, for
the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall have sole control of the defense, and
settlement or compromise thereof; _provided_ that (i) if the settlement does
not release the applicable Company Entities named as defendants from all
liabilities and obligations with respect to such Retained Matter or the
settlement imposes injunctive or other equitable relief against the Company
Entities, Seller shall obtain the prior written consent of Buyer (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of such
Retained Matter (it being understood and agreed that if Buyer does so consent
to such settlement, the Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to seek
indemnification for any Damages arising out of the specific claims which were
resolved by the settlement to which Buyer so consented), and (ii) Seller shall
keep Buyer reasonably apprised of material developments with respect to the
Retained Matters to the extent permitted under the common interest doctrine.
Seller understands and acknowledges that the settlement of a Retained Matter
(including any attendant publicity) could be relevant to public perceptions of
the Company. Accordingly, in addition to its other obligations under
the proviso to the preceding sentence, Seller agrees that it shall give Buyer
reasonable advance notice of any settlement, including the material proposed
terms thereof, and shall consult with Buyer in good faith with a view to
minimizing, to the extent practicable, any adverse impact on the reputation
of the Company resulting from any such settlement. If Seller proposes to enter
into a resolution of the "excessive fee" litigation included in the Retained
Matters in a manner that imposes an economic burden on Buyer or the Company,
Seller agrees to obtain the consent of Buyer, not to be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the parties agree that Seller
shall have the sole right to claim and collect any amounts available under
insurance coverage with respect to the Retained Matters, and the sole right to
administer, control, settle and resolve such claims for coverage. From and
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company Entities not to
commute, settle or otherwise diminish the insurance coverage available as of
the Closing Date with respect to the Retained Matters, and to cooperate fully
with Seller in connection with efforts to claim and collect any

 

 86    
  
 

 amounts available under such insurance (it being understood that ordinary
course submissions of claims by Buyer shall not violate the provisions of this
sentence).

 

  Section 11.04 _. Calculation of Damages._ (a) The amount of any Damages
payable under Section 11.02 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i)
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies (net of any increase in insurance premium incurred with respect to
the receipt of indemnification payments) or from any other Person alleged to
be responsible therefor, and (ii) Tax benefit actually received by the
Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Damages
(net of any Tax detriment incurred with respect to the receipt of
indemnification payments). If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts
under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for any Damages, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the amount actually received by the Indemnified Party, net of any
expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

 

  (b) The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable under Section 11.02 for
any (i) Damages relating to any matter to the extent that there is included in
the calculation of Final Stockholders Equity a specific liability or reserve
relating to such matter or the payment of which would result in a duplicative
payment to the Indemnified Party of amounts recovered as a purchase price
adjustment under Section 2.06 or (ii) consequential or punitive Damages,
except to the extent that such Damages have been or may be awarded to a Third
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no limitation in the preceding sentence
shall prevent or impair the ability of any Indemnified Party to seek to prove
that damages are calculated as a multiple of earnings if the matter giving
rise to such claim for Damages would have resulted in a reduction to the
recurring earnings upon which the Aggregate Purchase Price was based.

 

  Section 11.05 _. Assignment of Claims._ If the Indemnified Party
receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any
Damages pursuant to Section 11.02 and the Indemnified Party could have
recovered all or a part of such Damages from a third party (a "Potential
Contributor") based on the underlying Claim asserted against the Indemnifying
Party, the Indemnified Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed
against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying
Party to recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.

 

  Section 11.06 _. Exclusivity._ Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, effective as of the Closing Buyer waives and releases any and all
rights and claims (whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated,

 

 87    
  
 

 known or unknown, determined or determinable or otherwise) Buyer may have
against Seller, whether in law or in equity, relating to the Company or the
Class A Shares or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
rights and claims waived by Buyer include claims for contribution or other
rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any environmental matter,
claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty, negligent
misrepresentation and all other claims for breach of duty. Except with
respect to claims of (i) fraud or (ii) arising out of Section 2.04, 2.05, 2.06
or 5.02, after the Closing, Buyer acknowledges that its exclusive remedy
against Seller for any matter or claim arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any misrepresentation,
breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement set forth herein) is set forth
and contained in Article 8 and Article 11.

 

  Section 11.07 _. General._ (a) No right of indemnification hereunder
shall be limited by reason of any investigation or audit conducted before or
after the Closing or the knowledge of either party of any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the other party at any
time, or the decision of either party to complete the Closing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, each party shall have the right,
irrespective of any knowledge or investigation of such party, to rely fully,
and is relying fully, on the representations, warranties and covenants of the
other party contained herein.

 

  (b) For purposes of calculating Damages hereunder with respect to a
breach of a representation and warranty set forth in this Agreement (and not
for the purposes of determining whether a breach has occurred), any
limitations set forth in such representation and warranty as to "materiality"
or "Material Adverse Effect" shall be disregarded.

 

  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, the
limitations set forth in clauses (x) and (y) of the provisos to Sections
11.02(a) and 11.02(b) shall not apply to any breach of a representation or
warranty set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.06, 3.15(l)(ii), 3.23, 4.01, 4.02
and 4.08.

 

 ARTICLE 12 
 TERMINATION

 

  Section 12.01 _. Grounds for Termination._ This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing:

 

  (a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 

  (b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been
consummated on or before December 31, 2007 (the "Outside Date");  _provided_
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section shall not
be

 

 88    
  
 

 available to any party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement
results in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by the Outside Date;

 

  (c) by either Seller or Buyer if consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement would violate any nonappealable final order,
decree or judgment of any Governmental Authority having competent
jurisdiction;

 

  (d) by Buyer, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in
Section 10.02(b) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being
satisfied by the end date provided in clause (b) above; or

 

  (e) by Seller, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure
to perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause the condition set forth in
Section 10.03(b) not to be satisfied, and such condition is incapable of being
satisfied by the end date provided in clause (b) above.

 

  The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses (b)
through (e) above shall give notice of such termination to the other party.

 

  Section 12.02 _. Effect of Termination._ If this Agreement is
terminated as permitted by Section 12.01, such termination shall be effective
as against all parties hereto and without liability of either party (or any
stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or representative
of such party) to the other party to this Agreement; _provided_ that if such
termination shall result from the (i) failure of either party to fulfill a
condition to the performance of the obligations of the other party that is
within the control of such party or (ii) failure of either party to this
Agreement to perform a covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, such
party shall be fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by
the other party as a result of such failure or breach. The provisions of this
Section 12.02 and Sections 6.01, 13.03, 13.05, 13.06 and 13.07 shall survive
any termination hereof pursuant to Section 12.01.

contemplated hereby, all of which shall remain in full force and effect with
respect to Buyer). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
all obligations of Seller under this Agreement to cause any of its businesses
or Affiliates to take or not take any actions shall be in effect only for so
long as such business or Affiliate is controlled by Seller.

 

  Section 13.05 _. Governing Law._ This Agreement shall be governed by

transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be brought in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any New York
State court sitting in New York City, so long as one of such courts shall

courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit,
action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be

Beneficiaries._  This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures
thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a
counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have
no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether
by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication).

prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

 92    
  
 

  Section 13.10 _. Severability._ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a determination, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated

section of the Agreement is readily apparent. The parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) the Schedules to this Agreement may include certain items and
information solely for informational purposes for the convenience of Buyer and
(ii) the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the Schedules shall not be
deemed to constitute an acknowledgment by Seller that the matter is required
to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that the matter is material.

 

 93    
  
 

  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year
first above written.
