 (b) At the request of SibCo 1, concurrent with or immediately after the Effective Time, the Company shall transfer to the LLC any and all assets (including capital stock of Subsidiaries) and liabilities of the Company that may be transferred by the Company without obtaining consents or authorizations from any third party or Governmental Entity; and 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) At the Effective Time, each SibCo will assign to the LLC any and all rights and obligations of such SibCo pursuant to the Debt Financing, and the Surviving Corporation will cause the LLC to assume such rights and obligations. 

   

II. EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK 

   

 2.1 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the SibCos or the Merger Cos, the Company or the holder of any capital stock of any Merger Co or the Company: 

  

 (a) _Merger Consideration_. 

   

 (i) Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (each, a " _Common Share_ " and collectively, the " _Common Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, including Common Shares owned by any SibCo, any Merger Co or the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of any SibCo, any Merger Co or the Company or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries, but excluding (A) Dissenting Shares, (B) Agent Shares and (C) Management Shares (the Common Shares referred to in (A)-(C), the " _Excluded Common Shares_ " and the Common Shares referred to in (B)-(C), _"Retained Shares"_ )), will be converted into the right to receive $37.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "). 

  

 (ii) Management Shares shall not be converted into the Cash Consideration but shall instead remain outstanding, but renamed, as shares of Class A-1 common stock of the Surviving Corporation (" _Class A-1 Common Stock_"). Each Agent Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted automatically into the right to receive one share of Class A-2 common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (" _Class A-2 Common Stock_," such shares of Class A-2 Common Stock, together with the Class A-1 Common Stock remaining outstanding pursuant to this Article II, the " _Stock Consideration_ ," and the Stock Consideration, together with the Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

  

 (iii) Any Dissenting Shares will thereafter represent only the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in Section 2.3 upon compliance with the procedures set forth herein. 

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Common Shares_. At the Effective Time, all Common Shares will no longer be outstanding and all Common Shares will be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and, subject to Section 2.3, each Certificate formerly representing any such Common Shares will thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, in accordance with Section 2.2. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and owned by any SibCo, any Merger Co or the Company, except for any such shares held on behalf of third parties, will cease to be outstanding, will be cancelled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and will cease to exist. 

   

 (d) _Conversion of Merger Cos Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock of each of Merger Co 1, Merger Co 2 and Merger Co 3 issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one share of Class A-1 Common Stock; it being understood that the capitalization (including number of outstanding shares) of the Merger Cos will be adjusted prior to the Effective Time as necessary to give effect to Section 2.1(e). 

   

 (e) _Agent Share Ownership_. Giving effect to this Section 2.1, the ratio (x) of the number of shares of Class A-2 Common Stock issued in respect of Agent Shares in the Merger over (y) the aggregate number of shares of Class A-1 Common Stock issued in the Merger in respect of the cancellation of the capital stock of the Merger Cos shall be equal to the ratio of (1) the product of $37 and the number of Agent Shares at the Effective Time over (2) the aggregate equity capital of the Merger Cos at the Effective Time. 

   

 2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_. (a) _Paying Agent_. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will deposit, or will cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company appointed by SibCo 1 and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), (i) for the benefit of the holders of Common Shares (other than Excluded Common Shares), cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and (ii) for the benefit of the holders of Agent Shares, certificates representing the shares of Class A-2 Common Stock issuable at the Effective Time in the Merger pursuant to Section 2.1(a)(iii), in each case in exchange for the due surrender of the certificates formerly representing any such Common Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.2 (the cash deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2 being herein referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying Agent will invest the Payment Fund as directed by SibCo 1, provided that no such investment or losses will affect the cash amounts payable to holders of Common Shares. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment will be paid to the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Common Shares a letter of transmittal in customary form as reasonably agreed by the parties specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of 

    ##### 

  

    

loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent and instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss
in lieu thereof) in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper
surrender of a Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)
to the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor either (i) with respect to Common Shares other than
Retained Shares, cash in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings) that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Article II or (ii) with respect to Agent Shares, a book-entry account
statement reflecting ownership of (or, if requested, a stock certificate
representing) that number of shares of Class A-2 Common Stock into which the
shares of Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate are
converted in accordance with Section 2.1(a)(ii), and, in each case, the
Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be
paid or accrued on any cash amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, cash to be paid
upon due surrender of the Certificate may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Common Shares is presented to the
Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. 

   

 (c) _Withholding Taxes_. SibCo 1, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Common Shares any amounts that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payments under the Code and the rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Common Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

   

 (d) _No Further Transfers_. After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Common Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle transfers of Common Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent, they will be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company six months after the Effective Time will be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any certificates representing shares of Class A-2 Common Stock deposited with the Paying Agent 

    ##### 

  

    

pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and not exchanged within six months after the
Effective Time pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) will be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation, which will thereafter act as exchange agent. Any
former holder of Common Shares (other than Excluded Common Shares) who has
not theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration upon due
surrender of their Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none
of the SibCos, the Merger Cos, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Paying Agent or any other Person will be liable to any former holder of
Common Shares for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. 

   

 (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms the Surviving Corporation may determine is necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to the extent available under the DGCL, any Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by a stockholder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has neither voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and who has demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares and otherwise properly perfected and not withdrawn or lost their rights (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Cash Consideration. Such Dissenting Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under such Section 262 will thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and represent the right to receive, the Cash Consideration in the manner provided in Article II and shall no longer be Excluded Common Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.3, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will cease. The Company will give SibCo 1 prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal. The Company shall give SibCo 1 

   ##### 

  

    

the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal. The Company will not, except with the prior
written consent of SibCo 1, make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisals of Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands
or approve any withdrawal or other treatment of any such demands. 

  

 2.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes the number of Common Shares, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Shares, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

  

 2.5 _Treatment of Company Stock Options and Other Equity Based Awards_. (a) Each option to purchase Common Shares (collectively, the " _Company Stock Options_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans will become fully vested and exercisable and, except as provided in Exhibit 2.1(f), the holder of such Company Stock Option will, in settlement of such Company Stock Option and in exchange for the surrender to the Company of the certificate or other document evidencing such Company Stock Option, receive from the Company for each Common Share subject to such Company Stock Option, an amount (subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the difference between the Cash Consideration and the exercise price per Common Share, to the extent such difference is a positive number (with the aggregate amount of such payment rounded up to the nearest whole cent). At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option will be canceled and the holders of Company Stock Options will have no further rights in respect of any Company Stock Options. 

  

 (b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all forfeiture provisions applicable to restricted shares (collectively, the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") issued pursuant to the Company Benefit Plans (or under any individual agreement with a Company employee or current or former director of the Company) will lapse to the extent such forfeiture provisions have not previously lapsed in accordance with the terms of the Company Benefit Plans (or the terms of any individual agreement). Each holder of Restricted Shares will be treated as a holder of the corresponding number of Common Shares as of the Effective Time in accordance with Section 2.1(a) in the same manner as other outstanding Company Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) Each holder of each awarded and allocated share equivalent credit (collectively, the " _Company Share Credit Awards_ ") outstanding as of the Effective Time 

    ##### 

  

    

pursuant to the terms of the Phantom Share Credit Plans will, in settlement of
such Company Share Credit Awards and in exchange for the surrender to the
Company of any document evidencing such Company Share Credit Awards, receive
from the Company for each Company Share Credit Award, at such time as such
Company Share Credit Award would have become fully vested and
nonforfeitable (after taking into account any accelerated vesting in the UGA
Employee Long Term Bonus Program) pursuant to the terms of the applicable
Phantom Share Credit Plans as in effect as of the date hereof, an amount
(subject to any applicable withholding tax) in cash equal to the number of
shares subject to such Company Share Credit Awards held by such holder
multiplied by the Cash Consideration. To the extent the Company has not
previously done so, immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall reallocate all "forfeiture credits" in accordance with the terms of the
Phantom Share Credit Plans. 

   

 (d) The Company will take all actions necessary to ensure that all adjustments, allocations and amendments to or all such determinations required with respect to the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company Share Credit Awards required to implement the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.5 are taken or made.

 (ii) furnish or disclose any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a Person who has made a written Takeover Proposal not solicited in violation of this Section 5.4 if, prior to taking such action, the Company Board determines in good faith (A) after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (B) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary to comply with its fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Laws, but only so long as the Company (x) has caused such Person to enter into a confidentiality agreement with the Company on terms and conditions not less stringent than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (including the standstill provisions) and (y) concurrently discloses the same such non-public information to SibCo 1 if such non-public information has not previously been disclosed to SibCo 1; and

Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(and the response thereto from the SibCos, the Merger Cos or their respective
Representatives), and (iii) any event, change, occurrence, circumstance or
development between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time which
causes or is reasonably likely to cause the conditions set forth in Section
6.3(a) or 6.3(b) of this Agreement not to be satisfied or result in such
satisfaction being materially delayed. 

   

 5.6 _Company Disclosure Documents_. (a) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company will prepare a draft of the Company Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after the date on which (i) the Company receives notification from the SEC that "no-action" relief shall not be granted or (ii) SibCo 1 informs the Company that it has reasonably concluded based on advice from its outside counsel that registration of the shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation is required (such date, the " _Notification Date_ "), the Company will prepare a draft of the Company Registration Statement, in which the Company Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. The Company will provide SibCo 1 with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such draft, and once such draft is in a form reasonably acceptable to SibCo 1 and the Company, the Company will promptly file the Company Proxy Statement (or, if applicable, the Company Registration Statement) with the SEC, with respect to each such action as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (or, in the case of the Company Registration Statement, as promptly as practicable following the Notification Date).

    ##### 

  

    

Merger Cos should be discovered by the Company, the SibCos or the Merger Cos
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy
Statement (or, if applicable, the Company Registration Statement), so that
the Company Proxy Statement (or, if applicable, the Company Registration
Statement) will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such
information will promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the
SEC as promptly as practicable and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as practicable.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to responding to
any such comments or requests or the filing or mailing of the Company Proxy
Statement (or, if applicable, the Company Registration Statement) (or, in
either case, any amendment or supplement thereto), the Company (x) will
provide SibCo 1 and the Merger Cos with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any drafts of the Company Proxy Statement (or, if

filings and (y) will include in such drafts, correspondence and filings all
comments reasonably proposed by SibCo 1. 

   

 (c) The Company Proxy Statement (or, if applicable, the Company Registration Statement) will include the Company Board Recommendation unless the Company Board has withdrawn, modified or amended the Company Board Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.4(d). 

   

 5.7 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. The Company will call and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement for the purpose of voting on the adoption of this Agreement. The written consent of SibCo 1, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, will be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholder Meeting; _provided_ , that, in the event that there is present at such meeting, in person or by proxy, sufficient favorable voting power to secure the Requisite Company Vote, the Company will not adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting unless the Company is advised by counsel that failure to do so would result in a breach of the U.S. federal securities laws. The Company will (a) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from its stockholders proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement and (b) subject to Section 5.4(d), take all other reasonable action necessary to secure the Requisite Company Vote. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Sections 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.4, the Company will take all of the actions contemplated by this Section 5.7 regardless of whether the Company Board has approved, endorsed or recommended another Takeover Proposal or has withdrawn, 

    ##### 

  

  

modified or amended the Company Board Recommendation, and will submit
this Agreement for adoption by the stockholders of the Company at such
meeting. 

   

 5.8 _Employees; Benefit Plans_. (a) For a period of one year following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), the Surviving Corporation will provide employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than those employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement, if any) as of the Effective Time (" _Employees_ ") with compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate as those provided under the Companys compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies, practices and arrangements (other than equity incentives) in effect at the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein will prevent the amendment or termination of any specific plan, program or arrangement, require that the Surviving Corporation provide or permit investment in the securities of the Surviving Corporation or interfere with the Surviving Corporations right or obligation to make such changes as are necessary to comply with applicable Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing herein precludes the Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any Employee for any reason for which the Company could have terminated such Employee prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates will honor all Company Benefit Plans (including any severance, retention, change of control and similar plans, agreements and written arrangements) in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such plans, agreements or written arrangements. During the Continuation Period, the Surviving Corporation will provide all Employees (other than those covered by an individual agreement providing severance benefits outside the Companys severance policies who will receive the severance benefit provided for in such agreement) who suffer a termination of employment with severance benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such Employees under the Companys severance policies as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (c) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of the Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates providing benefits to any Employees after the Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Affiliates before the Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company and its Affiliates have given credit for prior service), to the same extent as such Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar or comparable Company Benefit Plans (except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of accrual of benefits). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing (i) each Employee immediately will be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and 

    ##### 

  

    

all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage
under a similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Employee
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ ") and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Employee,
the Surviving Corporation will cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
Employee and his or her covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions
or requirements were waived or were inapplicable under any similar or
comparable Company Benefit Plan, and the Surviving Corporation will cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such Employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
Employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (d) The applicable party will take all actions contemplated to be taken by it pursuant to Schedule 5.8(d). 

   

 (e) Prior to the Effective Time the Company will amend the Agent Stock Accumulation Plans as set forth in Schedule 5.8(e), provided that the final form of such amendment or amended plan shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to SibCo 1. 

   

 (f) No provision of this Section 5.8 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or its Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. 

   

 5.9 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. (a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which any present or former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (together, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining in whole or in part to, any action or failure to take action by any such Person in such capacity taken prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") will, from and after the Effective Time, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted or required by applicable Law and required by the Company Organizational Documents (or any similar organizational document) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, when applicable, and any indemnity agreements 

   ##### 

  

    

applicable to any such Indemnified Party or any Contract between
an Indemnified Party and the Company or one of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, in effect on the date of this Agreement, against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, legal and other expenses (including
reimbursement for legal and other fees and expenses incurred in advance of
the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each
Indemnified Party), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually
and reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, subject to the Surviving
Corporations receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay
such legal and other fees and expenses paid in advance if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified
under applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving
Corporation will not be liable for any settlement effected without the
Surviving Corporations prior written consent and will not be obligated to pay
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of
the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, except to the extent that two or more of such Indemnified
Parties shall have conflicting interests in the outcome of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation. 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation will (i) maintain in effect for a period of six years after the Effective Time, if available, the current policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company) or (ii) obtain as of the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of six years from the Effective Time with at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company, in each case, with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at the Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Corporation be required to expend an annual premium for such coverage in excess of 200% of the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). If such insurance coverage cannot be obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation will obtain that amount of directors and officers insurance (or "tail" coverage) obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this Section 5.9 will survive the Closing and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and its successors and representatives after the Effective Time and their rights under this Section 5.9 are in addition to, and will not be deemed to be exclusive of, any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, Contract, the

 (e) The obligations under this Section 5.9 may not be terminated or modified by the Surviving Corporation in a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 5.9 applies without the consent of the affected Indemnified Party.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with applicable Laws, each of the parties to this Agreement will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to ensure that the conditions set forth in Article VI are satisfied and to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including (i) obtaining all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and making all necessary registrations and filings and taking all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (ii) making, as promptly as practicable, an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and not extending any waiting period under the HSR Act or entering into any agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ ") or the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the " _Antitrust Division_ ") not to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (iii) obtaining all consents, approvals or waivers from, or taking other actions with respect to, third parties necessary or advisable to be obtained or taken in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the placement of legends as contemplated by the Voting Agreement if applicable); _provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written consent of SibCo 1 (which consent may not be 

   ##### 

  

  

unreasonably withheld or delayed) the Company and its Subsidiaries may not
pay or commit to pay any amount of cash or other consideration, or incur or
commit to incur any liability or obligation, in connection with obtaining
such consent, approval or waiver, (iv) subject to first having used
reasonable best efforts to negotiate a resolution of any
objections underlying such lawsuits or other legal proceedings, defending and
contesting any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed, and (v) executing and delivering any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. 

   

 (b) The SibCos, the Merger Cos and the Company will cooperate and consult with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, notifications and any other material actions pursuant to this Section 5.10, subject to applicable Law, by permitting counsel for the other party to review in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed material written communication to any Governmental Entity and by providing counsel for the other party with copies of all filings and submissions made by such party and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with any Governmental Entity and any other information supplied by such party and such partys Affiliates to a Governmental Entity or received from such a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,  _provided_ , _however_ , that material may be redacted (x) to remove references concerning the valuation of the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (y) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements, and (z) as necessary to address good faith privilege or confidentiality concerns. None of the SibCos, the Merger Cos or the Company may file any such document or take such action if the other party has reasonably objected (and not withdrawn its objection) to the filing of such document or the taking of such action on the grounds that such filing or action would reasonably be expected to either (i) prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) cause a condition set forth in Article VI to not be satisfied in a timely manner. None of the SibCos, the Merger Cos nor the Company will consent to any voluntary extension of any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent of the other party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

   

 (c) The SibCos, the Merger Cos and the Company will promptly inform the other party upon receipt of any material communication from the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any SibCo, any Merger Co or the Company (or any 

   ##### 

  

    

of their respective Affiliates) receives a request for additional information
or documentary material from any such Governmental Entity that is related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party will
endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. The parties agree not
to participate, or to permit their Affiliates to participate, in any
substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement unless it so consults with the other party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate. Each party will advise the other
parties promptly of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or
written) which the first party proposes to make or enter into with the FTC,
the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each party will use reasonable best efforts to
resolve any objections that may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under any antitrust, competition or trade or
insurance regulatory Laws, including (subject to first having used reasonable
best efforts to negotiate a resolution to any such objections) contesting and
resisting any action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to have such statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order repealed,
rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no party is required to, and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of SibCo 1, become subject, consent or agree to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any of its Affiliates in any manner which, individually or in the aggregate with all other such requirements, conditions, understandings, agreements and Orders, is materially adverse to the Company and its Affiliates, taken as a whole, whether before or after giving effect to the Merger, or requires any change in the conduct of the business of the Company and its Affiliates, in any material respect, as presently conducted (a " _Burdensome Condition_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company will, upon request of SibCo 1, become subject, consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or Order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or 

   ##### 

  

    

otherwise change the assets or business of the Company or any of its
Affiliates, so long as such requirement, condition, understanding, agreement
or Order is binding on the Company only in the event that the
Closing occurs. 

   

 5.11 _Public Announcements_. The SibCos, the Merger Cos and the Company will consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements about this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the SibCos, the Merger Cos and the Company will issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except to the extent that the disclosing party determines in good faith it is required to do so by applicable Laws or the NYSE requirements, in which case that party will use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any such release or making any such public statement. 

  

 5.12 _Stock Exchange Listing_. At the request of SibCo 1, promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause the Common Shares to be delisted from the NYSE and deregistered under the Exchange Act. 

  

 5.13 _Fees, Expenses and Conveyance Taxes_. Whether or not the Merger is consummated, all expenses (including those payable to Representatives) incurred by any party to this Agreement or on its behalf in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (" _Expenses_ ") will be paid by the party incurring those Expenses, except as otherwise provided in Sections 5.15 and 7.6. 

  

 5.14 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Voting Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement, each of the SibCos, each of the Merger Cos and the Company and their respective boards of directors will (a) take all necessary action to ensure that such transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such takeover statute. 

  

 5.15 _Financing; Funding_. 

  

 (a) Each of the SibCos will comply with its obligations under the Commitment Letter and will use its reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein and (ii) to satisfy all conditions applicable to such SibCo 1 in such definitive agreements that are within its control. In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, SibCo 1 will seek in good faith to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources on equivalent or more favorable terms 

   ##### 

  

    

to the SibCos (as determined in the reasonable judgment of SibCo 1) as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event. SibCo 1 will
give the Company prompt notice of any material breach by any party of the
Commitment Letter or any termination of the Commitment Letter. SibCo 1 will
keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail
of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing as may be reasonably
requested by the Company and will not permit any material amendment or
modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material provision or remedy
under, the Commitment Letter without first consulting with the Company or, if
such amendment would or would be reasonably expected to materially and
adversely affect, or delay in any material respect, the SibCos or the Merger
Cos ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
without first obtaining the Companys prior written consent (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, none of the SibCos or the Merger Cos will be
required to incur greater economic costs (including with respect to rates or
fees) than is required under the Commitment Letter. 

   

 (b) The Company will reasonably cooperate, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to reasonably cooperate, with each of the SibCos, each of the Merger Cos and each of their respective financing sources in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by SibCo 1 or such Merger Co (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions and due diligence sessions, (ii) furnishing such SibCo or Merger Co and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by such SibCo or Merger Co, (iii) assisting SibCo 1 and their respective financing sources in the preparation of (A) an offering document for any debt raised to consummate the Debt Financing and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of SibCo 1 and its financing sources for any debt arranged by the SibCos to consummate the Debt Financing, (v) forming new direct or indirect Subsidiaries, (vi) satisfying the conditions of the Commitment Letter that explicitly require action by the Company, and (vii) providing and executing documents as may be reasonably requested by SibCo 1 and any Merger Co (including any pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents, and other certificates (including solvency certificates), or documents as may be reasonably or customarily requested by the banks and lenders);  _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof will be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time. In the event that this Agreement is terminated other than by SibCo 1 under Section 7.3, SibCo 1 will promptly reimburse the Company for reasonable out-of-pocket costs, not exceeding $500,000 in the aggregate, incurred by 

   ##### 

  

    

the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Companys cooperation
with the SibCos and the Merger Cos pursuant to this Section 5.15. 

   

 (c) The Merger Cos agree that, in the event that (i) all of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.2 (except for the condition set forth in Section 6.2(f)), and Section 6.3 (except for the condition set forth in Section 6.3(b) as it relates to this Section 5.15(c)) are satisfied (or waived in accordance with to this Agreement) and (ii) the condition set forth in Section 6.2(f) would be satisfied but for the satisfaction of any condition to the Debt Financing requiring funding of the Equity Commitment, then, immediately prior to the Effective Time the Merger Cos shall, individually or collectively, have an aggregate amount in cash or available funds equal to $1,160 million, or such lesser amount that, together with the proceeds of the Debt Financing and any cash on hand at the Company and the LLC, is sufficient to allow the Surviving Corporation to pay the Cash Consideration payable (other than with respect to any Dissenting Shares or Retained Shares) in accordance with Article II. 

   

 5.16 _No-Action Letter_. As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company will prepare and file with the SEC a request for the issuance by the SEC of a "no action" letter in a form reasonably acceptable to SibCo 1 with respect to certain securities matters previously discussed between representatives of the parties relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 5.17 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may take such steps as may be reasonably requested by any party hereto to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters. 

  

 5.18 _Resignations_. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to SibCo 1 at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to SibCo 1 of the resignation effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the Company or any Subsidiary designated by SibCo 1 to the Company in writing at least five calendar days prior to the Closing. 

  

 5.19 _Affiliate Termination Agreements_. Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to terminate the sale of assets agreement, as amended, in effect as of the date of this Agreement, between the Company and Special Investment Risks, Ltd., on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to SibCo 1; _provided_ that the termination of such agreement in a transaction in which the total 

   ##### 

  

  

financial obligation incurred by the Company is $47.5 million or less will be
deemed to be reasonably acceptable to SibCo 1 without further action. 

   

 5.20 _BHC Act_. The Company will not engage, either directly or through any entity that the Company would be deemed to control for the purposes of the BHC Act and Regulation Y, in any activity that is not permissible for a financial holding company under, and as defined in, the BHC Act and Regulation Y.

Agreement, or (c) unless prohibited by applicable Laws, waive compliance with

on the part of a party to any extension or waiver will be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by such party. The failure of any

   ##### 

  

    

Sections of, and Exhibits to, this Agreement unless the context requires
otherwise. The words "include," "includes" and "including" are not limiting
and will be deemed to be followed by the phrase "without limitation." The
phrases "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import will be
deemed to refer to this Agreement as a whole, including the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The

instruments or Laws defined or referred to in this Agreement will be

 (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Letter or the Acquiror Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty will not be deemed an admission that such item is material or has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or Acquiror Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be. 

   

 8.3 _Survival_. None of the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered under this Agreement will survive the Effective Time.

   ##### 

  

  

 8.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.

Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
