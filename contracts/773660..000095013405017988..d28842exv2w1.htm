for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Common Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms the Surviving Corporation

not withdrawn or lost their rights (the &#147;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&#148;) in accordance with Section&nbsp;262
of the DGCL will not be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Cash Consideration.
Such Dissenting Stockholders will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of
Dissenting Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of such Section&nbsp;262, except that
all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who have failed to perfect or who effectively have
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under such Section&nbsp;262 will
thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and represent the right to receive, the Cash
Consideration in the manner provided in Article&nbsp;II and shall no longer be Excluded Common Shares.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section&nbsp;2.3, if the Merger is rescinded
or abandoned, then the right of any stockholder to be paid the fair value of such stockholder&#146;s
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL will cease. The Company will give SibCo 1
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received by the Company relating to
