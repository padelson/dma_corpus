RECITALS

WHEREAS the BMHC Board and the SBS Board have each approved this Agreement,
determined that the terms of this Agreement are in the best interests of BMHC
or SBS, as applicable, and their respective stockholders and declared the
advisability of this Agreement; 

WHEREAS, in order to induce BMHC to enter into this Agreement and to cause the
Merger to be consummated, certain executive officers of SBS, in their
capacity as stockholders of SBS, and certain other stockholders of SBS listed
on Exhibit A-1 hereto (the " _Major SBS Holders_ "), are executing voting and
support agreements in favor of BMHC concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement in the form substantially attached hereto as
Exhibit A-2 (the " _SBS Support Agreements_ ");

 

WHEREAS, in order to induce SBS to enter into this Agreement and to cause the
Merger to be consummated, certain executive officers of BMHC, in their
capacity as stockholders of BMHC, and certain other stockholders of BMHC
listed on Exhibit B-1 hereto (the " _Major BMHC Holders_ "), are executing
voting and support agreements in favor of SBS concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement in the form substantially attached hereto as
Exhibit B-2 (the " _BMHC Support Agreements_ ");

 

WHEREAS, it is expected that within two Business Days after the Form S-4 is
declared effective under the Securities Act, the holders of BMHC Common Stock
sufficient to adopt and approve this Agreement and the Merger as required
under Sections 228 and 251 of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), the BMHC Certificate and the BMHC By-Laws
will execute and deliver an action by written consent adopting this
Agreement, in a form reasonably acceptable to SBS, in order to obtain the BMHC

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, but
effective only as of the Effective Time, SBS, certain of the Major SBS
Holders and certain of the Major BMHC Holders have entered into a registration
rights agreement, attached as Exhibit C hereto (the " _Registration Rights

Support Agreements, the " _Ancillary Agreements_ "), pursuant to which and
subject to the terms thereof SBS has granted such Major SBS Holders and Major
BMHC Holders certain registration rights in respect of the shares of
SBS Common Stock held by the Major SBS Holders or to be received by the Major
BMHC Holders in the Merger;

WHEREAS for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
(the " _Intended Tax Treatment_ "), and this Agreement is intended to be, and
is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and
361 of the Code; and WHEREAS BMHC and SBS desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties and covenants herein and intending to be legally bound, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_The Merger_

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, on the Closing
Date, BMHC shall be merged with and into SBS (the " _Merger_ "). At the
Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of BMHC shall cease, and SBS
shall continue as the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Company_ ").

Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger shall
take place at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York 10022 at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be
specified by BMHC and SBS, which shall be no later than the third Business
Day following the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by
the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set
forth in ARTICLE VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), or at such other place, time
and date as shall be agreed in writing between BMHC and SBS. The date
on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing
Date."

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall cause to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of
merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form
as required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL, and shall make all other filings required under the
DGCL or by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in connection with
the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate
of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or at such later time as BMHC and SBS shall agree and specify in
the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.04 _Effects_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and Section 259 of the DGCL.

Section 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of SBS shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of SBS, be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth on Exhibit D hereto
and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms
and as provided by the DGCL.

 



2 (b) The SBS By-laws as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the by-laws of
the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms
and the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Company and as provided
by the DGCL.

 

ARTICLE II

_Effect on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of
Certificates_

Section 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of BMHC, SBS or the holder of
any shares of BMHC Common Stock or SBS Common Stock:

 

(a) _Effect on SBS Common Stock_. Each share of SBS Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued
and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Company and shall not
be affected by the Merger.

(b)  _Cancellation of BMHC Treasury Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.001, of BMHC (the " _BMHC Common Stock_ ") that is owned by BMHC as
treasury stock or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
BMHC immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Canceled Shares_ ")
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

(c) _Conversion of BMHC Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.02, each share of
BMHC Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Canceled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted
into the right to receive 0.5231 fully paid and nonassessable shares (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") of SBS Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All
such shares of BMHC Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such shares of BMHC Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of SBS
Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.02(f) and any dividends or other
distributions to which holders become entitled upon the surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(d), without interest, in each case
to be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with Section 2.02(b). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding
shares of SBS Common Stock or BMHC Common Stock shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class or series of stock, by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have
occurred, then any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the
number of shares of SBS Common Stock or BMHC Common Stock, as the case may be,
will be appropriately adjusted to provide to SBS and the holders of BMHC
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event. As provided in Section 2.02(j), the right of any holder of a
Certificate to receive the Merger Consideration shall be subject to and
reduced by the amount of any withholding under applicable Tax Law.

 



3 (d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of BMHC Common Stock held by a
Person who has not voted in favor of, or consented in writing to, the adoption
of this Agreement and has complied with all the provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares of BMHC Common Stock to
demand appraisal of such shares of BMHC Common Stock (such Person, a "
_Dissenting Stockholder_ " and such shares, " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall
not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
described in Section 2.01(c), but shall become the right to receive such
payment of fair value as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the procedures
set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws
its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of
appraisal with respect to any Dissenting Shares, in any case pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL, each such Dissenting Share shall thereupon be treated
as though such Dissenting Share had been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c). At the Effective Time,
the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. BMHC shall give SBS prompt written
notice of (i) any demands for appraisal of shares of BMHC Common Stock
received by BMHC prior to the Effective Time, (ii) any withdrawal of any such
demand and (iii) any other notice or instrument delivered to BMHC with respect
to any such demand prior to the Effective Time. BMHC shall not make any
payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any
such demand, notice or instrument unless SBS shall have given its written
consent to such payment or settlement offer, which written consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the
Closing Date, SBS shall enter into an exchange agent agreement in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to BMHC with a bank or trust company
reasonably acceptable to BMHC to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_
") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and the amounts provided under
Section 2.02(d) and Section 2.02(f). At or prior to the Effective Time, SBS
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates (other than Canceled Shares or Dissenting Shares), book-entry
shares (or certificates if requested) representing shares of SBS Common Stock
to be issued as Merger Consideration, any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.02(d) and cash sufficient to make payments in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f). All such SBS Common
Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent is hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ ".

 

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, SBS shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of
BMHC Common Stock (i) a form of letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as SBS may specify, subject to BMHCs reasonable approval),
together with instructions thereto and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash
in lieu of fractional shares of BMHC Common Stock and any dividends or

 



4  other distributions to which such Certificates become entitled in accordance
with Section 2.02(d).

 

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon
surrender of Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with the Letter of
Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor (i) the Merger Consideration issuable in respect of such
shares of BMHC Common Stock represented by such Certificates pursuant to
Section 2.01 and (ii) any cash in lieu of fractional shares which the holder
has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect of any
dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 2.02(d). In the event of a transfer of ownership of BMHC
Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of BMHC, a
certificate representing the proper number of shares of SBS Common Stock
issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 and cash in lieu of fractional shares which
the holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in
respect of any dividends or other distributions which the holder has the right
to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(d) may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such BMHC Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(c), each share
of BMHC Common Stock represented by a Certificate (other than Canceled Shares
and Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time from and after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration which the holders of shares of BMHC Common Stock were
entitled to receive in respect of such shares pursuant to Section 2.01 (and
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and in respect
of any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.02(d)). No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this ARTICLE II upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions, if
any, declared or made with respect to SBS Common Stock with a record date at
or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of SBS Common Stock issuable upon
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(f), until the surrender
of such Certificate in accordance with this ARTICLE II. Subject to escheat,
Tax or other applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be paid to the holder of the certificate or book-entry shares
representing whole shares of SBS Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of any cash
payable in lieu of a fractional share of SBS Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(f) and the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of SBS Common Stock and (ii) at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such whole
shares of SBS Common Stock.

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in BMHC Common Stock_. The shares of SBS
Common Stock issued and cash paid in accordance with the terms of this
ARTICLE II upon

 



5  conversion of any shares of BMHC Common Stock (including any cash paid
pursuant to subsection (f) of this Section 2.02) shall be deemed to have been
issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of BMHC Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, subject to applicable
Law (in the case of Dissenting Shares) and the treatment contemplated by
Section 2.01(b) of Canceled Shares, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Company of shares of
BMHC Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing
shares of BMHC Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Company, SBS or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this ARTICLE II, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates representing fractional shares of
SBS Common Stock or scrip or warrants entitling the holder to receive
fractional shares of SBS Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion of
BMHC Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of BMHC Common Stock
converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of SBS Common Stock (after taking into account
all shares of BMHC Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional
amount multiplied by the last reported sale price of SBS Common Stock on the
Nasdaq Global Select Market (" _Nasdaq_ ") (as reported at www.nasdaq.com or,
if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by
SBS and BMHC) on the last complete trading day prior to the date of the
Effective Time.

 

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest received with respect thereto) that
remains undistributed to the holders of BMHC Common Stock for 180 days after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to SBS, upon demand, and any holder of
BMHC Common Stock (other than the Dissenting Stockholders) who has not
theretofore complied with this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to SBS
for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and distributions to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to this ARTICLE II, in each case without any interest
thereon.

(h) _No Liability_. None of BMHC, SBS or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to
any Person in respect of any portion of the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, any
portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of
Certificates for two years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to
such earlier date on which the Exchange Fund would otherwise escheat to, or
become the property of, any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of SBS, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(i) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by SBS. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments shall be paid to SBS. Until the termination of the
Exchange Fund pursuant to Section 2.02(g), if for any reason the cash in the
Exchange Fund is insufficient to fully satisfy all 

 



6  of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent
hereunder, SBS will promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an amount
equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such
cash payment obligations.

(j) _Withholding Rights_. Each of SBS and the Exchange Agent
(without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any holder of BMHC Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax Law. To the
extent that amounts are so required under applicable Tax Law to be deducted or
withheld from the payment of Merger Consideration to a holder of BMHC Common
Stock, each of BMHC, SBS and the Exchange Agent (and any other Person that
has a withholding obligation pursuant to this Agreement, without duplication)
is hereby authorized to sell whole shares of SBS Common Stock comprising such
portion of the Merger Consideration otherwise payable to the holder of such
BMHC Common Stock as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to BMHC, SBS or
the Exchange Agent (or any such other Person that has a withholding obligation
pursuant to this Agreement), as the case may be, to enable it to comply
with such deduction or withholding requirement and BMHC, SBS or the Exchange
Agent (or any such other Person that has a withholding obligation pursuant to
this Agreement) shall notify such holder of such sale and (x) remit the
applicable portion of the net proceeds of such sale to the appropriate taxing
authority and (y) remit the remaining net proceeds of such sale (after
deduction for the amounts described in clause (x)) to such holder. Amounts so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of BMHC
Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

(k) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
SBS, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as SBS may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to Section
2.02(g), SBS) shall issue the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares and any dividends and distributions deliverable pursuant to
this Agreement in respect of the shares of BMHC Common Stock represented by
the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

ARTICLE III are true and correct except as set forth in the SBS SEC Documents
filed or furnished and publicly available on or after August 8, 2013, and at
least two days prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Filed SBS SEC
Documents_ ") (excluding any disclosures in the Filed SBS SEC Documents in
any risk factors section, in any section related to forward looking statements
and other disclosures that are predictive or forward-looking in nature) or in
the disclosure letter

 



7  delivered by SBS to BMHC at or before the execution and delivery by SBS of
this Agreement (the " _SBS Disclosure Letter_ "). The SBS Disclosure Letter
shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections contained in this ARTICLE III, and the
disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify other sections in this
ARTICLE III to the extent (and only to the extent) that it is reasonably
apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure also qualifies
or applies to such other sections; provided that disclosure of any fact,
circumstance or information shall be deemed to be disclosed on Section
3.03(a) or Section 3.08 of the SBS Disclosure Letter only if expressly set
forth thereon, without cross references.

Section 3.01  _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of SBS and each of its
Subsidiaries (the " _SBS Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is
organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent such jurisdiction
recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the SBS Subsidiaries, where
the failure to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have an SBS Material Adverse
Effect. Each of SBS and the SBS Subsidiaries has all requisite power and
authority and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits,
authorizations, registrations, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals
(collectively, " _Permits_ ") necessary to enable it to own, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted in all material respects (the " _SBS Permits_ "). Each of
SBS and the SBS Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business in
each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties make such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed, individually
or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
an SBS Material Adverse Effect. SBS has delivered or made available to BMHC,
prior to execution of this Agreement, true and complete copies of the amended
and restated certificate of incorporation of SBS in effect as of the date of
this Agreement (the " _SBS Certificate_ ") and the amended and restated by-
laws of SBS in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _SBS By-laws_

Subsidiary, free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges, mortgages, deeds of
trust, rights of first offer or first refusal, options, encumbrances and
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively,
with covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, encroachments, title
retention agreements or other third party rights or title defect of any kind
or nature whatsoever, " _Liens_ "), except for Liens related to indebtedness
reflected in the SBS SEC Documents or that are otherwise not material, and
free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,
sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock, voting securities or other
equity interests), except for restrictions imposed by applicable securities
Laws. Section 3.02(a) of the SBS Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date
of this Agreement, a true and complete list of the SBS Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Except for the capital stock and voting securities of, and other equity
interests in, the SBS Subsidiaries, neither SBS nor any SBS Subsidiary owns,
directly or indirectly, any capital stock or voting securities of, or other
equity interests in, or any interest

 



8  convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any capital stock or
voting securities of, or other equity interests in, any firm, corporation,
partnership, company, limited liability company, trust, joint venture,
association or other entity. No SBS Subsidiary owns any shares of capital
stock or other equity securities of SBS.

consists of 300,000,000 shares of SBS Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of

prior to the adoption of the SBS Stock Plan that remain outstanding, and (vii)
892,456 shares of SBS Common Stock were reserved and available for issuance
pursuant to the SBS Stock Plan. Section 3.03(a) of the SBS Disclosure Letter
contains a correct and complete list, as of June 1, 2015, of SBS Restricted
Stock, SBS Restricted Stock Units and SBS Stock Options issued and outstanding
under the SBS Stock Plan or otherwise, including the holder, type of award,

for shares of capital stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests
in, SBS or any SBS Subsidiary, (y) any warrants, calls, options, restricted
or performance stock units, or other rights to acquire from SBS or any SBS

to be issued, transferred, disposed of, redeemed, repurchased, acquired,

any SBS Subsidiary, the value of SBS, any SBS Subsidiary or any part of SBS or
any SBS Subsidiary or any dividends or other distributions declared or paid on
any shares of capital stock of SBS or any SBS Subsidiary (collectively, "
_Contingent SBS Equity_ "). From the close of business on June 1, 2015 to the

SBS Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock or voting securities or other equity interests of SBS or any
SBS Subsidiary or any Contingent SBS Equity. With respect to SBS Stock
Options, each grant of an SBS Stock Option was duly authorized no later than
the date on which the grant of such SBS Stock Option was by its terms to be
effective (the " _Grant Date_ ") by all necessary corporate action, including,
as applicable, approval by the SBS Board (or a duly constituted and authorized
committee thereof), and the per share exercise price of each SBS Stock Option
was at least equal to the fair market value of a share of SBS Common Stock on

SBS Subsidiary having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable
for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders

requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the receipt of
the SBS Stockholder Approval. The board of directors of SBS (the " _SBS Board_

for approval and adoption, respectively,

 



10  at a duly held meeting of such stockholders for such purpose (the " _SBS

_SBS Stockholder Approval_ "), as well as the approval of the Stock Plan
Amendment by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares
of SBS Common Stock represented in person or by proxy at the SBS Stockholders
Meeting, no other corporate actions on the part of SBS are necessary to
authorize, adopt or approve, as applicable, this Agreement or to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except
for the filing of the appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL).
SBS has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by BMHC, this Agreement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of SBS, enforceable against it
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally and to general equity
principles (the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

Section 3.05 _No Conflicts; Consents_. (a) The execution and delivery by SBS
of this Agreement does not, and the performance by SBS of its obligations
hereunder and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not, conflict with, or result in any
violation or breach of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time,
or both) under, or give rise to a right of, or result in, termination,
modification, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, any obligation
to make an offer to purchase or redeem any Indebtedness or capital stock or
any loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties, rights or assets of SBS or any SBS Subsidiary

assets is bound or any SBS Permit or (iii) subject to the filings and other
matters referred to in Section 3.05(b), any judgment, writ, injunction, award,

each case, applicable to SBS or any SBS Subsidiary or their respective
properties or assets (assuming that the SBS Stockholder Approval is obtained),
other than, (A) in the case of clause (ii) above, any matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have an SBS Material Adverse Effect (it being agreed that for
purposes of this Section 3.05(a), effects resulting from or arising in
connection with the matters set forth in clause (iv) of the definition of
"Material Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded in determining whether an SBS
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur)
and would not prevent or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay
the consummation of the Merger, and (B) in the case of clause (iii) above,
matters that are not material to SBS and would not prevent or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the Merger.

Section 3.06 _SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_. (a) SBS has furnished
or filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements, registration statements,
prospectuses and other documents (including exhibits and other information
incorporated therein) required to be furnished or filed by SBS with the SEC
since August 8, 2013 (such documents, together with any documents filed with
the SEC during such period by SBS on a voluntary basis, but excluding the
Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement and the Form S-4, being collectively
referred to as the " _SBS SEC Documents_ ").

 

(b) Each SBS SEC Document (i) at the time filed or furnished (or, if amended
or superseded by a filed or furnished SBS SEC Document prior to the date of
this Agreement, then on the date of such filing or furnishing), complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
(" _SOX_ "), the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, in each case to the
extent applicable to such SBS SEC Document, and the rules and regulations of
the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such SBS SEC Document and (ii)
did not at the time it was filed or furnished (or if amended or superseded by
a filing or amendment prior to the date of this Agreement, then at the time
of such filing or amendment) contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances

 



12  under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated
financial statements of SBS included in the SBS SEC Documents (including, in
each case, any notes or schedules thereto) and all related compilations,
reviews and other reports issued by SBSs accountants with respect thereto has
been derived from the accounting books and records of SBS and its consolidated
Subsidiaries and complied at the time it was filed as to form in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, was prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except,
in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the SEC for Form 10-Q)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of SBS and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their operations,
stockholders equity and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in the
case of unaudited statements, to the absence of footnotes and to normally
recurring and non-material year-end adjustments). No financial statements of
any Person other than SBS and its consolidated Subsidiaries are required by
GAAP to be included in the consolidated financial statements of SBS. Except
as required by GAAP and as disclosed in the SBS SEC Documents, between August
8, 2013 and the date of this Agreement, SBS has not made or adopted any
material change in its accounting methods, practices or policies.

(c) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments from the SEC with respect
to any of the SBS SEC Documents and none of the SBS SEC Documents (other than
confidential treatment requests) is, to the Knowledge of SBS, the subject of
ongoing SEC review. There are no internal investigations, any SEC inquiries or
investigations or other governmental inquiries or investigations pending or,
to the Knowledge of SBS, threatened, in each case regarding any accounting
practices of SBS. SBS has been and is in material compliance with the
applicable provisions of SOX and the applicable rules and regulations of
Nasdaq.

(d) Except (i) as reflected or reserved against in SBSs consolidated audited
balance sheet as of December 31, 2014 (or the notes thereto) as included in
the Filed SBS SEC Documents, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice since December
31, 2014, and (iii) for liabilities incurred in connection with or
contemplated by this Agreement, neither SBS nor any SBS Subsidiary has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or
would reasonably be expected to have an SBS Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Each of the chief executive officer of SBS and the chief financial
officer of SBS (or each former chief executive officer of SBS and each former
chief financial officer of SBS, as applicable) has made all applicable
certifications required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and
Sections 302 and 906 of SOX with respect to the SBS SEC Documents, and the
statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate. For
purposes of this Agreement, "chief executive officer" and "chief financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in SOX. None of SBS or
any of the SBS Subsidiaries has outstanding, or has arranged any outstanding,
"extensions of credit" to directors or executive officers within the meaning
of Section 402 of SOX.

 



13 (f) SBS maintains a system of "internal control over financial reporting" (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) sufficient to
provide reasonable assurance (A) that transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP,
consistently applied, (B) that transactions are executed only in accordance
with the authorization of management and (C) regarding prevention or timely
detection of the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of SBSs
properties or assets.

 

(g) SBS maintains "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) reasonably designed to ensure
that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by SBS in the reports that it files or furnishes under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the management of SBS, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to enable the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer of SBS to make the
certifications required under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports.

(h) SBSs management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of
SBSs internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and
procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law, presented in any
applicable SBS SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or
any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures as of
the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Based on SBSs managements most recently completed evaluation of
SBSs internal control over financial reporting, (i) SBS had no significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of its
internal control over financial reporting that would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect SBSs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (ii) SBS does not have Knowledge of any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in SBSs internal control over financial reporting. To the
Knowledge of SBS, no executive officer or director of SBS has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of, and to the Knowledge of SBS, no
auditor, accountant, or representative of SBS has provided written notice to
SBS or any executive officer or director of, any substantive complaint or
allegation that SBS or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in improper
accounting practices. To the Knowledge of SBS, no attorney representing SBS or
any of the Subsidiaries of SBS has reported to the SBS Board or any committee
thereof or to any current director or executive officer of SBS evidence of a
material violation of United States or other securities Laws or breach of
fiduciary duty by SBS or any of its executive officers or directors.

 

(i) Neither SBS nor any of the SBS Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance-sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement

Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA, including the SBS Pension Plans,
any trust created thereunder or, to the Knowledge of SBS, any trustee or
administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term
is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other

or any officer of SBS or any SBS Subsidiary to the Tax or penalty on
prohibited transactions imposed by the Code, ERISA or other applicable Law,
(iv) no SBS Pension Plans and trusts have been terminated, nor is there any

Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement, a complete and
correct list identifying each SBS Multiemployer Plan and each SBS Pension
Plan.

 



17 (d) With respect to each SBS Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit
plan, such SBS Benefit Plan (including any SBS Benefit Plan covering retirees

material liability to SBS and the SBS Subsidiaries on or at any time after
the Effective Time.

SBS Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction with any
other event, including any termination of employment on or following the
Effective Time) will (A) entitle any current or former director, officer,
employee or consultant of SBS or any of the SBS Subsidiaries to any
compensation or benefit, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
trigger any payment or funding, of any compensation or benefits or trigger any
other material obligation under any SBS Benefit Plan or (C) result in any
breach or violation of, default under or limit SBSs right to amend, modify or
terminate any SBS Benefit Plan.

 

(i) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of the consummation of the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction with
any other event, including any termination of employment on or following the
Effective Time) by any current or former director, officer, employee or
consultant of SBS or any of its Subsidiaries under any SBS Benefit Plan or
otherwise, would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or
would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. Neither SBS
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any indemnity obligation on or after the
Effective Time for any Taxes imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

(j) All contributions required to be made to any SBS Benefit Plan by
applicable Law, regulation, any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any SBS Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on
the financial statements set forth in the SBS SEC Documents. Each SBS Benefit
Plan that is an

 



18  employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA either (i) is
funded through an insurance company contract and is not a "welfare benefit
fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii) is unfunded.

Subsidiary becoming part of the Combined Company. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, neither SBS nor any SBS Subsidiary, nor any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in

are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable
actuarial assumptions.

 

Section 3.11 _Litigation_. There is no suit, action, charge, complaint, audit,
investigation, grievance or other proceeding (" _Proceeding_ ") pending or,
to the Knowledge of SBS, threatened against SBS or any SBS Subsidiary or any
of their respective properties or assets that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have an SBS Material

expected to have an SBS Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.11 of the SBS
Disclosure Letter sets forth a list, as of the date hereof, of each Proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of SBS, threatened against SBS or any SBS
Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or assets that would
reasonably be expected to result in damages (net of insurance and expected
payments from third-parties under applicable indemnities) exceeding
$1,000,000.

Section 3.12 _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. SBS and the SBS Subsidiaries
are and have been since January 1, 2012, in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable Laws and material SBS Permits. To the Knowledge
of SBS, no allegation or Proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity is
pending or threatened alleging that SBS or an SBS Subsidiary is not in
compliance in all material respects with any applicable Law or material SBS
Permit or which challenges or questions the validity of any rights of the
holder of any material SBS Permit. All material SBS Permits are in full force

both) has occurred under any such SBS Permit and none of SBS or the SBS
Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental
Entity threatening to suspend, revoke, withdraw or modify any such SBS

respects with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the
" _FCPA_ ") and any other United States and foreign Laws concerning corrupt
payments. Since January 1, 2012, neither SBS nor any SBS Subsidiary has been
investigated by any Governmental Entity with respect to, or given notice by a
Governmental Entity of, any 

 



19  violation by SBS of the FCPA or any other U.S. or foreign Laws concerning
corrupt payments. This section does not relate to Tax matters, employee
benefits matters or environmental matters, which are the subjects of Sections
3.09, 3.10 and 3.13, respectively. Since January 1, 2012, neither SBS nor any

Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section 3.14(c), effects

Properties are, taken as a whole, adequate and sufficient, and in
satisfactory

 



22  condition, to support the operations of SBS and the SBS Subsidiaries as
presently conducted. Neither SBS nor any SBS Subsidiary has leased or
otherwise granted to any Person the right to use or occupy the SBS Properties

SBS Subsidiary is in exclusive possession of the properties or assets
purported to be leased under all the SBS Leases, except for (i) such failures
to have such possession of material properties or assets as, individually or
in the aggregate, do not materially impair and would not reasonably be
expected to materially impair, the continued use and operation of such
material properties and assets to which they relate in the conduct of SBS and
SBS Subsidiaries as presently conducted and (ii) failures to have such
possession of immaterial properties or assets as, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have an

to the Knowledge of SBS, any other party to each SBS Lease is in material
breach or default under such lease and neither SBS nor any of the SBS
Subsidiaries has Knowledge of any event or occurrence that has resulted or
would reasonably be expected to result (with or without the giving of notice,

Lease. Neither SBS nor any SBS Subsidiary has collaterally assigned or granted
any other security interest in such SBS Leases or any interest therein.

Property Rights_ ") that are used or held for use in and material to the
continued operation of their business as presently conducted. No actions,
suits or other Proceedings are pending or, to the Knowledge of SBS, threatened
in writing against SBS or any of the SBS Subsidiaries that (i) allege that
SBS or any of the SBS Subsidiaries is infringing, misappropriating or
otherwise violating Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person or (ii)
challenge the use, ownership, enforceability, validity, patentability
or registrability of any material Intellectual Property Rights owned by SBS
or any SBS Subsidiaries. None of the material Intellectual Property Rights
owned by SBS or any SBS Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding consent,
settlement, ruling, injunction or other outstanding order of any Governmental
Entity adversely affecting SBSs ownership, use or disposition thereof or any
rights with respect thereto. To the Knowledge of SBS, (A) neither 

 



23  SBS nor any of the SBS Subsidiaries nor the conduct of their respective
businesses as presently conducted is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise
violating any Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person and (B) no
Person is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any material
Intellectual Property Rights owned by SBS or any of the SBS Subsidiaries.
Since January 1, 2012, no prior or current employee or officer or prior or

Subsidiaries has asserted or, to the Knowledge of SBS, has any ownership in
any material Intellectual Property Rights purported to be owned, or that are

of their respective businesses. SBS and the SBS Subsidiaries take commercially
reasonable actions, including those common in the industry, to maintain and
protect their material confidential information and other material
Intellectual Property Rights (including the secrecy, confidentiality and value
of their trade secrets), and use commercially reasonable efforts to protect

Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2012, to the Knowledge of SBS, neither SBS nor

collective bargaining agreements and other Contracts with any labor
organization (including all amendments thereto) applicable to any employees of
SBS or any SBS Subsidiary, including any expired collective
bargaining agreements whose terms remain in force, in whole or in part, with

in the SBS CBAs, neither SBS nor any SBS Subsidiary, as of the date of this
Agreement, has entered into any agreement, arrangement, understanding or
Contract, whether written or oral, with any labor organization or other
employee representative body which would prevent, restrict or materially
impede the consummation of the Merger or other transactions contemplated by

similar program within its or their respective workforces (or any part of
them). Since January 1, 2012, neither SBS nor any SBS Subsidiary has

disability rights or benefits, immigration, wages, hours, overtime
compensation, child labor, hiring, promotion and termination of employees,
working conditions, meal and break periods, privacy, health and safety,
workers compensation, leaves of absence and unemployment insurance. To the
Knowledge of SBS, all employees of SBS and the SBS Subsidiaries are properly
classified under the Fair Labor Standards Act and state and local wage and
hour Laws in all material respects. There are no material Proceedings against
SBS or the SBS Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of SBS, threatened to be

employment of any current or former applicant, employee, consultant
or independent contractor of SBS or any SBS Subsidiary including, without
limitation, any claim relating to unfair labor practices, employment
discrimination, harassment, retaliation, equal pay, wage and hours or any
other employment-related matter arising under applicable Laws. Since January

intention of an SBS Significant Supplier not to continue as a supplier of SBS
and its Subsidiaries or to terminate or materially modify existing Contracts
with SBS and its Subsidiaries.

Section 3.23 _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The SBS Board has received an
oral opinion from the SBS Financial Advisor, to be confirmed in writing (with
a copy provided, only for informational purposes, to BMHC promptly upon

subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and conditions
set forth therein, the Exchange Ratio to be paid in the Merger by SBS is fair
to SBS from a financial point of view.

Section 3.24  _Insurance_. Each of SBS and the SBS Subsidiaries maintains
insurance policies with reputable insurance carriers against all risks of a

(including any such breach or default with respect to the payment of premiums
or the giving of notice) under any such policy and the aggregate
coverage that continues to be available under each such policy is not
materially less than the original aggregate coverage available under such

shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections contained in this ARTICLE IV, and the
disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify other sections in this
ARTICLE IV to the extent (and only to the extent) that it is reasonably

recognizes such concept), except, in the case of the BMHC Subsidiaries, where
the failure to be in good standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not

licensed, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a BMHC Material Adverse Effect. BMHC has
delivered or made available to SBS, prior to execution of this Agreement, true

of the BMHC Unaudited Financial Statements, to the absence of footnotes and
to normally recurring and non-material year-end adjustments), (ii) have been
prepared from the accounting books and records of BMHC and the BMHC
Subsidiaries and (iii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved, except as may be indicated

weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal control over financial
reporting that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect BMHCs ability

arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange
Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, BMHC or any of the Subsidiaries of BMHC in the BMHC Financial
Statements.

 

(g) Since January 1, 2012, none of BMHC, BMHCs independent accountants, the
BMHC Board or the audit committee of the BMHC Board has received any oral or
written notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" in the internal
controls over financial reporting of BMHC, (y) "material weakness" in the
internal controls over financial reporting of BMHC or (z) fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees of BMHC who have a
significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting of BMHC.

DGCL and the Exchange Act and the

 



32  rules and regulations thereunder, except that no representation is made by
BMHC with respect to statements made or incorporated by reference therein

Code, have been the subject of, have timely applied for or have not been
eligible to apply for, as of the date of this Agreement, determination letters
or opinion letters from the IRS to the effect that the form of such
BMHC Benefit Plans and the trusts created thereunder are so qualified and
tax-exempt, and no such determination letter or opinion letter has been
revoked nor, to the Knowledge of BMHC, has revocation been threatened, nor has
any such BMHC Benefit Plan been amended since the date of its most recent
determination letter or application therefor in any respect that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect its qualification or materially
increase its costs.

302 of ERISA, Section 412 or 430 of the Code or Section 4971 of the Code (a "
_BMHC Pension Plan_ ") had, as of the respective last annual valuation date

that have been furnished to SBS, (ii) none of the BMHC Pension Plans either
(A) has an "accumulated funding deficiency" or (B) has failed to meet any
"minimum funding standards", as applicable (under Section 302 or 303 of ERISA

BMHC Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA, including the BMHC Pension
Plans, any trust created thereunder or, to the Knowledge of BMHC, any trustee
or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such
term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any
other breach of fiduciary responsibility that could subject BMHC, any BMHC
Subsidiary or any officer of BMHC or any BMHC Subsidiary to the Tax or penalty
on prohibited transactions imposed by the Code, ERISA or other applicable
Law, (iv) no BMHC Pension Plans and trusts have been terminated, nor is there

(v) no BMHC Benefit Plans and trusts are the subject of any Proceeding by any
Person, including any Governmental Entity, that could be reasonably expected
to result in a termination of any BMHC Benefit Plan or trust, (vi) there has
not been any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of
ERISA) with respect to any BMHC Pension Plan during the last six years as to
which the 30-day advance-notice requirement has not been waived and (vii)
neither BMHC nor any BMHC Subsidiary has, or within the past six years had,
contributed to, been required to contribute to, or has any liability or
potential liability (including "withdrawal liability" within the meaning of
Title IV of ERISA) with respect to, any BMHC Multiemployer Plan. Section
4.10(c) of the BMHC Disclosure Letter sets forth, as of the date of this
Agreement, a complete and correct list identifying each BMHC Multiemployer
Plan and each BMHC Pension Plan.

 

(d) With respect to each BMHC Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit
plan, such BMHC Benefit Plan (including any BMHC Benefit Plan covering
retirees or other former employees) may be amended to reduce benefits or limit
the liability of BMHC or the BMHC Subsidiaries or terminated, in each case,
without material liability to BMHC and the BMHC Subsidiaries on or at any time
after the Effective Time.

(e) No BMHC Benefit Plan provides health, medical or other welfare benefits
after retirement or other termination of employment (other than for

other funding vehicle has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms, the terms of any applicable collective bargaining
agreement and is in compliance with ERISA, the Code and all other Laws
applicable to such BMHC Benefit Plan and (ii) BMHC and each of the BMHC
Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with ERISA, the Code
and all other Laws applicable to the BMHC Benefit Plans.

 

(g) There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of BMHC, threatened claims by or
on behalf of any participant in any of the BMHC Benefit Plans, or otherwise
involving any

 



35  such BMHC Benefit Plan or the assets of any BMHC Benefit Plan, other than
routine claims for benefits.

 

(h) None of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the obtaining of the
BMHC Stockholder Approval or the consummation of the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (alone or in conjunction with any
other event, including any termination of employment on or following the
Effective Time) will (A) entitle any current or former director, officer,
employee or consultant of BMHC or any of the BMHC Subsidiaries to any
compensation or benefit, (B) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
trigger any payment or funding, of any compensation or benefits or trigger any
other material obligation under any BMHC Benefit Plan or (C) result in any
breach or violation of, default under or limit BMHCs right to amend, modify
or terminate any BMHC Benefit Plan. Neither BMHC nor any of its Subsidiaries
has any indemnity obligation on or after the Effective Time for any Taxes
imposed under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code.

(i) All contributions required to be made to any BMHC Benefit Plan by
applicable Law, regulation, any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any BMHC Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on
the financial statements set forth in the BMHC Financial Statements. Each BMHC
Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of
ERISA either (i) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a
"welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii)
is unfunded. 

(j) There does not now exist, nor, to the Knowledge of BMHC, do any
circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability that
would be a liability of BMHC or any BMHC Subsidiary following the Closing
exclusive of any Controlled Group Liability related to SBS or any SBS
Subsidiary becoming part of the Combined Company. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, neither BMHC nor any BMHC Subsidiary, nor any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in
(i) Section 4069 of ERISA or (ii) Section 4204 or 4212 of ERISA with respect
to any BMHC Multiemployer Plans.

(k) All BMHC Benefit Plans subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside the
United States (i) have been maintained, funded and administered in accordance
with all applicable requirements, (ii) if they are intended to qualify for
special tax treatment, meet all the requirements for such treatment, and (iii)
if they are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, are fully funded
and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial
assumptions.

 

Section 4.11 _Litigation_. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge
of BMHC, threatened against BMHC or any BMHC Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties or assets that, individually or in the aggregate, has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a BMHC Material Adverse Effect,
nor is there any Judgment outstanding against or, to the Knowledge of BMHC,
investigation by any Governmental Entity involving BMHC or any BMHC Subsidiary
or any of their respective properties or assets that, individually or in the

 



36  aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a BMHC Material
Adverse Effect. Section 4.11 of the BMHC Disclosure Letter sets forth a list,
as of the date hereof, of each Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of
BMHC, threatened against BMHC or any BMHC Subsidiary or any of their
respective properties or assets that would reasonably be expected to result in
damages (net of insurance and expected payments from third-parties under
applicable indemnities) exceeding $1,000,000. On January 4, 2010, the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware entered an order discharging all
claims that existed (whether filed or that could have been filed) on or
before January 4, 2010 against BMHC or any of the BMHC Subsidiaries.

Section 4.12 _Compliance with Applicable Laws_. BMHC and the BMHC
Subsidiaries are and have been since January 1, 2012, in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable Laws and material BMHC Permits. To the
Knowledge of BMHC, no allegation or Proceeding by or before any Governmental
Entity is pending or threatened alleging that BMHC or a BMHC Subsidiary is not
in compliance in all material respects with any applicable Law or material
BMHC Permit or which challenges or questions the validity of any rights of
the holder of any material BMHC Permit. All material BMHC Permits are in full
force and effect, no material default (with or without notice, lapse of time
or both) has occurred under any such BMHC Permit and none of BMHC or the BMHC
Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any Governmental Entity
threatening to suspend, revoke, withdraw or modify any such BMHC Permit. BMHC
and the BMHC Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the
FCPA and any other United States and foreign Laws concerning corrupt
payments. Since January 1, 2012, neither BMHC nor any BMHC Subsidiary has been
investigated by any Governmental Entity with respect to, or given notice by a
Governmental Entity of, any violation by BMHC of the FCPA or any other U.S.
or foreign Laws concerning corrupt payments. This section does not relate to
Tax matters, employee benefits matters or environmental matters, which are the
subjects of Sections 4.09, 4.10 and 4.13, respectively. Since January 1,
2012, neither BMHC nor any BMHC Subsidiary has been the subject of any audit,
investigation or enforcement action by any Governmental Entity in connection
with any Contract to which any Governmental Entity is a party. Neither
BMHC nor any BMHC Subsidiary has been debarred, suspended or otherwise made
ineligible from doing business with the United States government or any
government contractor.

in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
BMHC Material Adverse Effect:

of, or has liability under, any Environmental Law or any Permit issued

(b) BMHC and the BMHC Subsidiaries have obtained and are and have been since
January 1, 2012 in compliance with all Permits issued pursuant to any
Environmental Law applicable to BMHC, the BMHC Subsidiaries and the BMHC

be subject to modification or revocation as a result of the

 



37  transactions contemplated by this Agreement (it being agreed that for
purposes of this Section 4.13(a)(ii), effects resulting from or arising in
connection with the matters set forth in clause (iv) of the definition of
"Material Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded in determining whether a BMHC
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to
occur);

 

(c) there are no Environmental Claims pending or, to the Knowledge of BMHC,
threatened against BMHC or any of the BMHC Subsidiaries;

 

(d) there have been no Releases of any Hazardous Material that could

have, retained or assumed, either contractually or by operation of Law; and

 

(e) neither BMHC nor any of the BMHC Subsidiaries has retained or assumed,

Material Contract_ ".

 

(b) Except for the matters which, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a BMHC Material Adverse
Effect (it being agreed that for purposes of this Section 4.14(b), effects
resulting from or arising in connection with the matters set forth in clause
(iv) of the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" shall not be excluded in
determining whether a BMHC Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would
reasonably be expected to occur), (i) each BMHC Material Contract (including,

notice of termination or cancellation of any BMHC Material Contract, and
no party to any BMHC Material Contract has provided written notice exercising

Section 4.15 _Properties_. (a) BMHC and each BMHC Subsidiary has good and
valid title to, or good and valid leasehold interests in, or other right to
use, all their respective material properties and assets (the " _BMHC
Properties_ "), free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens. The
BMHC Properties are, taken as a whole, adequate and sufficient, and in
satisfactory condition, to support the operations of BMHC and the BMHC
Subsidiaries as presently conducted. Neither BMHC nor any BMHC Subsidiary has
leased or otherwise granted to any Person the right to use or occupy the
BMHC Properties owned by BMHC or a BMHC Subsidiary (the " _Owned BMHC
Properties_ "). Other than the rights set forth pursuant to this Agreement,
there are no outstanding options, rights of first offer or rights of first
refusal to purchase such

 



39  Owned BMHC Properties or any portion thereof or interest therein. This
Section 4.15 does not relate to Intellectual Property Rights matters, which
are the subject of Section 4.16.

 

(b) BMHC and each of the BMHC Subsidiaries has complied in all material
respects with the terms of all leases, subleases and licenses entitling it to
the use of real property owned by third parties (" _BMHC Leases_ "), and all
BMHC Leases are legal, valid, binding, in full force and effect and
enforceable, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. Section 4.15(b)
of the BMHC Disclosure Letter sets forth the address of and expiration date
for each of the BMHC Leases. BMHC has delivered to SBS a true and complete
copy of each BMHC Lease (including all amendments, extensions,
renewals, guaranties and other agreements with respect thereto), and in the
case of any oral lease that is material, a written summary of the material
terms of such lease. BMHC and each BMHC Subsidiary is in exclusive possession
of the properties or assets purported to be leased under all the BMHC Leases,
except for (i) such failures to have such possession of material properties or
assets as, individually or in the aggregate, do not materially impair and
would not reasonably be expected to materially impair, the continued use and
operation of such material properties and assets to which they relate in the
conduct of BMHC and BMHC Subsidiaries as presently conducted and (ii) failures
to have such possession of immaterial properties or assets as, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have
a BMHC Material Adverse Effect. Neither BMHC nor any of the BMHC Subsidiaries
nor, to the Knowledge of BMHC, any other party to each BMHC Lease is in
material breach or default under such lease and neither BMHC nor any of the
BMHC Subsidiaries has Knowledge of any event or occurrence that has resulted
or would reasonably be expected to result (with or without the giving
of notice, the lapse of time or both) in a default with respect to any
material BMHC Lease. Neither BMHC nor any BMHC Subsidiary has collaterally
assigned or granted any other security interest in such BMHC Leases or any
interest therein.

 

Section 4.16 _Intellectual Property_. BMHC and the BMHC Subsidiaries own or
have the right to use all Intellectual Property Rights that are used or held
for use in and material to the continued operation of their business as
presently conducted. No actions, suits or other Proceedings are pending or, to
the Knowledge of BMHC , threatened in writing against BMHC or any of the BMHC
Subsidiaries that (i) allege that BMHC or any of the BMHC Subsidiaries is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating Intellectual Property
Rights of any other Person, or (ii) challenge the use, ownership,
enforceability, validity, patentability or registrability of any material
Intellectual Property Rights owned by BMHC or any BMHC Subsidiaries. None of
the material Intellectual Property Rights owned by BMHC or any BMHC
Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding consent, settlement, ruling,
injunction or other outstanding order of any Governmental Entity adversely
affecting BMHCs ownership, use or disposition thereof or any rights with
respect thereto. To the Knowledge of BMHC, (A) neither BMHC nor any of the
BMHC Subsidiaries nor the conduct of their respective businesses as presently
conducted is infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any
Intellectual Property Rights of any other Person and (B) no Person is
infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating any material Intellectual
Property Rights owned by BMHC or any of the BMHC

 



40  Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2012, no prior or current employee or officer
or prior or current licensee, consultant or contractor of BMHC or any of the
BMHC Subsidiaries has asserted or, to the Knowledge of BMHC, has any
ownership in any material Intellectual Property Rights purported to be owned,
or that are used or held for use, by BMHC or any of the BMHC Subsidiaries in
the operation of their respective businesses. BMHC and the BMHC Subsidiaries
take commercially reasonable actions, including those common in the industry,
to maintain and protect their material confidential information and other
material Intellectual Property Rights (including the secrecy,
confidentiality and value of their trade secrets), and use commercially
reasonable efforts to protect and maintain their information technology
systems, including the data stored therein, and to provide for the continuity,
integrity, and security thereof, as well as the back-up and recovery of data
stored therein.

Section 4.17 _Product Liability and Warranty_. Section 4.17 of the BMHC
Disclosure Letter sets forth the standard warranties offered by BMHC and the
BMHC Subsidiaries (excluding pass-through manufacturers warranties) for all
services provided by, and all products manufactured, sold, leased or
delivered by, BMHC and the BMHC Subsidiaries, it being understood that
customer warranties routinely supersede the standard warranties offered by
BMHC and the BMHC Subsidiaries. Since January 1, 2012, to the Knowledge of
BMHC, neither BMHC nor any of the BMHC Subsidiaries has taken any action, nor
has any event or series of actions occurred, which is reasonably likely to
give rise to a material increase in product warranty claims from BMHCs
historical experience.

 

Section 4.18 _Affiliate Transactions_. There are no agreements, Contracts,
understandings or undertakings between BMHC or any BMHC Subsidiary, on the
one hand, and any Affiliate of BMHC, on the other hand (other than the BMHC
Subsidiaries), that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of
Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act (collectively, " _BMHC Affiliate
Transactions_ ").

Section 4.19 _Labor Matters_.

 

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, Section 4.19 of the BMHC Disclosure
Letter sets forth a true and complete list of all collective bargaining or
other Contracts with any labor organization applicable to any employees of
BMHC or any of the BMHC Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of BMHC, no labor
organization, employee representative or group of employees of BMHC or any
BMHC Subsidiary has made a demand for recognition or certification or engaged
in any union organizing or decertification activities since January 1, 2012,
and there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions
seeking a representation proceeding presently pending or threatened to be
brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or any other
Governmental Entity. To the Knowledge of BMHC, there are no organizing
activities, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts or other material
labor disputes pending or threatened against or involving BMHC or any BMHC
Subsidiary, and no such material disputes have occurred since January 1, 2012.
None of BMHC or any of the BMHC Subsidiaries has breached or otherwise failed
to comply in any material respect with any provision of any collective
bargaining agreement or other Contract with any labor organization applicable
to any employees of BMHC or any of the BMHC Subsidiaries. There are
no material grievances, arbitrations, charges or complaints outstanding or,
to the Knowledge of BMHC, threatened. BMHC has made available to SBS true and
complete copies of all collective bargaining agreements and other Contracts
with any labor organization (including all amendments thereto) applicable to
any employees of BMHC or any BMHC Subsidiary, including any expired collective
bargaining agreements whose terms remain in force, in whole or in part, with
respect to such employees (the " _BMHC CBAs_ "). Except as otherwise set
forth in the BMHC CBAs,

 



41  neither BMHC nor any BMHC Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement, has
entered into any agreement, arrangement, understanding or Contract, whether
written or oral, with any labor organization or other employee representative
body which would prevent, restrict or materially impede the consummation of
the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
implementation of any layoff, redundancy, severance or similar program within
its or their respective workforces (or any part of them). Since January 1,
2012, neither BMHC nor any BMHC Subsidiary has implemented any facility
closing or layoff of employees requiring notice under the WARN Act.

the intention of a BMHC Significant Supplier not to continue as a supplier of
BMHC and its

regulation (including Section 203 of the DGCL), nor any takeover-related
provision in the BMHC Certificate or BMHC By-laws, is applicable to BMHC, SBS,

or restrict the ability of BMHC to perform its obligations under this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Certificate of Merger, or its

Agreements or the Certificate of Merger.

situated companies in the same or similar businesses. Each material insurance
policy of BMHC or any BMHC Subsidiary is in full force and effect and was in
full force and effect during the periods of time such insurance policy is
purported to be in effect, and neither BMHC nor any of the BMHC Subsidiaries
is (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) in breach or default
(including any such breach or default with respect to the payment of premiums
or the giving of notice) under any such policy and the aggregate coverage
that continues to be available under each such policy is not materially less
than the original aggregate coverage available under such policy. As of the
date of this Agreement, there is no claim by BMHC or any of the
BMHC Subsidiaries pending under any such policies that (a) to the Knowledge
of BMHC, has been denied or disputed by the insurer other than denials and
disputes in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, or
(b) if not paid would be material to BMHC.

representations and warranties contained in this ARTICLE IV, SBS acknowledges
that none of

 



43  BMHC, the BMHC Subsidiaries or any other Person on behalf of BMHC makes any

prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously

or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this

listen" communication by the SBS Board pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the
Exchange Act or (B) within ten Business Days of a tender or exchange offer
relating to securities of SBS having been commenced, fail to
publicly recommend against such tender or exchange offer or fail to publicly
reaffirm the SBS Recommendation or (C) following the announcement by a third
party of a bona fide SBS Acquisition Proposal by such third party, fail to
reaffirm publicly the SBS Recommendation by the earlier to occur of five
Business Days prior to the date of the SBS Stockholders Meeting (as such date

request therefor by BMHC (or such shorter period as may exist between the
date of the SBS Acquisition Proposal and the date of the SBS Stockholders
Meeting) (any action in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 5.02(b)
being referred to as a " _SBS Recommendation Change_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject in
each case to SBSs compliance with Section 5.02(d), at any time prior to
obtaining the SBS Stockholder Approval:

(i) SBS and its Representatives may, in response to a bona fide, written SBS

with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor could reasonably be
expected to result in an SBS Superior Proposal, (x) furnish information
relating to SBS and its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business,
properties, assets, books and records of SBS and its Subsidiaries, to the

been provided to BMHC or is provided to BMHC prior to or substantially
concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person) pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less
favorable in the aggregate to SBS than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (other than with respect to standstill provisions), and (y) engage
or participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such SBS
Acquisition Proposal regarding the terms of such SBS Acquisition Proposal and
the negotiation of such terms with, and only with, the Person making such SBS
Acquisition Proposal (and such Persons Representatives);

(i) of Section 5.02(b) (a " _SBS Intervening Event Recommendation Change_ ")
in connection with an SBS Intervening Event; and

terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) to enter into a
definitive Acquisition Agreement, in each case, with respect to a bona fide,
written SBS Acquisition Proposal that did not result primarily from a breach
of this Section 5.02 if the SBS Board determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes an SBS Superior Proposal (a " _SBS Superior
Proposal Termination_ "); _provided_ that concurrently with any such
termination SBS pays the SBS Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section
8.02(a)(i) and enters into such definitive Acquisition Agreement concurrently
therewith or promptly thereafter (and any purported termination in accordance
with this clause (iii) shall be void and of no force or effect unless
concurrently with such termination SBS pays the SBS Termination Fee
payable pursuant to Section 8.02(a)(i) and otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Section 5.02).

(d) SBS (and the SBS Board, SBS Subsidiaries and SBSs Representatives) shall
be entitled to take action pursuant to Section 5.02(c) only if (i) in all
circumstances referred to in Section 5.02(c), the SBS Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under the Laws of the State of Delaware and (ii) in all
circumstances referred to in Section 5.02(c)(ii) and Section 5.02(c)(iii), in
addition to complying with clause (i) of this Section 5.02(d), prior to
effecting any SBS Intervening Event Recommendation Change or SBS Superior
Proposal Termination, as the case may be, (A) SBS shall notify BMHC in
writing at least four Business Days prior to effecting such SBS Intervening
Event Recommendation Change or SBS Superior Proposal Termination of its
intention to effect such SBS Intervening Event Recommendation Change or SBS
Superior Proposal Termination (which notice shall, if in connection with an
SBS Intervening Event, include reasonable detail regarding the SBS Intervening
Event or, if in connection with an SBS Superior Proposal Termination, include
the material terms and conditions of such SBS Superior Proposal, the identity
of the third party, and a copy of the most recent draft of any written
agreement relating thereto (it being understood and agreed that any
material amendment to the terms of such SBS Superior Proposal shall require a
new notice period as contemplated hereby of at least three Business Days)),
(B) during the applicable notice period contemplated by clause (A), SBS shall
negotiate with BMHC 

 



52  in good faith (to the extent BMHC wishes to negotiate) to make such
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that the SBS
Intervening Event Recommendation Change is no longer necessary or the SBS
Superior Proposal ceases to be an SBS Superior Proposal, as applicable, and
(C) at the end of such notice period, the SBS Board, taking into consideration
any changes to this Agreement offered in writing by BMHC, determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisor, that such SBS Intervening Event continues to necessitate an SBS
Intervening Event Recommendation Change or such SBS Superior Proposal
continues to meet the definition of "SBS Superior Proposal" if such changes
were to be given effect, as applicable, and that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under the Laws of
the State of Delaware.

(e) SBS shall promptly, and in any event within 48 hours of the receipt
thereof, advise BMHC in writing of any proposals or offers with respect to an
SBS Acquisition Proposal (including any request for nonpublic information from
or any discussions or negotiations that are sought to be initiated or
continued with SBS, the SBS Board or SBSs Representatives with respect to
any such SBS Acquisition Proposal), a copy of (or, if oral, a summary of the
material terms and conditions of) any such SBS Acquisition Proposal (including
any material changes thereto) and the identity of the Person making any such
SBS Acquisition Proposal or requesting information or discussions. SBS shall
(i) keep BMHC informed in all material respects and on a reasonably prompt
basis of the status and details (including any change to the terms thereof) of
any matters contemplated by this Section 5.02(e), and (ii) provide to BMHC as
soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all
correspondence and other written material exchanged between SBS or any of its
Subsidiaries and any Person that describes any of the material terms or
conditions of any SBS Acquisition Proposal (or, if such communications are
oral, provide to BMHC a summary of the material terms and conditions of any
SBS Acquisition Proposal).

 

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 5.02 shall be deemed to prohibit SBS or
the SBS Board or any committee thereof from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law, including taking and disclosing
to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a)
under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders), so
long as any action taken or statement that relates to an SBS Recommendation
Change made to so comply is consistent with this Section 5.02, or (ii) issuing
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of SBS pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the
stockholders of SBS). For the avoidance of doubt, complying with such
obligations or making such disclosure shall not in any way limit or modify
the effect that any such action has under this Agreement, including whether
there has been an SBS Recommendation Change.

 

Section 5.03 _No Solicitation by BMHC; BMHC Board Recommendation_.

 

(a) None of BMHC, the BMHC Board, or any of BMHCs Subsidiaries shall, nor
shall BMHC or any of its Subsidiaries authorize or permit any of its or their
Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, induce or
knowingly facilitate or encourage the submission or announcement of any BMHC
Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiries, proposals or offers that
may reasonably be expected to lead to a BMHC Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any
information relating to BMHC

 



53  or any of its Subsidiaries or afford access to the business, properties,
assets, books or records of BMHC or any of its Subsidiaries to, or otherwise
cooperate in any way with, assist or facilitate any Person (whether or not a
Person making a BMHC Acquisition Proposal) with respect to, or cooperate in
any way with any Person with respect to any BMHC Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a BMHC
Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve, recommend or declare advisable, or
propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable, or allow BMHC or any of
its Affiliates to execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement
constituting or related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any BMHC Acquisition Proposal, or requiring, or
reasonably expected to cause, BMHC to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to
consummate, or that would otherwise impede, interfere with or be inconsistent
with, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (iv) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. BMHC
shall, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to (and BMHC shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
its other Affiliates to), immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore
with respect to any BMHC Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal
that may reasonably be expected to lead to a BMHC Acquisition Proposal,
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished, immediately terminate all physical and electronic
dataroom access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives,
and, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, take such action as is
reasonably necessary to enforce any "standstill" provisions or provisions of
similar effect to which it is a party or of which it is a beneficiary (except
that the BMHC Board, or any committee thereof, may grant any waiver, amendment
or release thereof if it has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law).
Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.03(a) by any Representative of BMHC
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this
Section 5.03(a) by BMHC.

 

(b) Except in accordance with Section 5.03(c) and subject to BMHCs compliance
with Section 5.03(d), neither the BMHC Board nor any committee thereof shall
(i) withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify), in any manner adverse to SBS,
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the BMHC Board
or any committee thereof with respect to this Agreement (the " _BMHC
Recommendation_ ") or fail to include the BMHC Recommendation in the
Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement, (ii) adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable, or propose or resolve to adopt, approve, recommend or
declare advisable (publicly or otherwise), any BMHC Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) following the announcement by a third party of a bona fide BMHC
Acquisition Proposal by such third party, fail to reaffirm publicly the BMHC
Recommendation by five Business Days following a request therefor by SBS (any
action in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 5.03(b) being referred to
as a " _BMHC Recommendation Change_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject in
each case to BMHCs compliance with Section 5.03(d), at any time prior to
obtaining the BMHC Stockholder Approval:

 



54 (i) BMHC and its Representatives may, in response to a bona fide, written
BMHC Acquisition Proposal that did not result primarily from a breach of
Section 5.03(a) and that the BMHC Board determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor could
reasonably be expected to result in a BMHC Superior Proposal, (x) furnish
information relating to BMHC and its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the
business, properties, assets, books and records of BMHC and its Subsidiaries,
to the Person making such BMHC Acquisition Proposal (and its Representatives)
( _provided_ that all such information and access being furnished has
previously been provided to SBS or is provided to SBS prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person) pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement that contains
provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to BMHC than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (other than with respect to
standstill provisions), and (y) engage or participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such BMHC Acquisition Proposal regarding
the terms of such BMHC Acquisition Proposal and the negotiation of such terms
with, and only with, the Person making such BMHC Acquisition Proposal (and
such Persons Representatives);

(ii) the BMHC Board may make a BMHC Recommendation Change described in clause
(i) of Section 5.03(b) (a " _BMHC Intervening Event Recommendation Change_ ")
in connection with a BMHC Intervening Event; and

 

(iii) the BMHC Board may make a BMHC Recommendation Change and BMHC may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(h) to enter into a
definitive Acquisition Agreement, in each case, with respect to a bona fide,
written BMHC Acquisition Proposal that did not result primarily from a breach
of this Section 5.03 if the BMHC Board determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a BMHC Superior Proposal (a " _BMHC Superior
Proposal Termination_ "); _provided_ that concurrently with any such
termination BMHC pays the BMHC Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section
8.02(b)(ii) and enters into such definitive Acquisition Agreement concurrently
therewith or promptly thereafter (and any purported termination in
accordance with this clause (iii) shall be void and of no force or effect
unless concurrently with such termination BMHC pays the BMHC Termination Fee
payable pursuant to Section 8.02(b)(ii) and otherwise complies with the
provisions of this Section 5.03).

(d) BMHC (and the BMHC Board, BMHC Subsidiaries and BMHCs Representatives)
shall be entitled to take action pursuant to Section 5.03(c) only if (i) in
all circumstances referred to in Section 5.03(c), the BMHC Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial
advisor, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under the Laws of the State of Delaware and (ii) in all
circumstances referred to in Section 5.03(c)(ii) and Section 5.03(c)(iii), in
addition to complying with clause (i) of this Section 5.03(d), prior to
effecting any BMHC Intervening Event Recommendation Change or BMHC Superior
Proposal Termination, as the case may be, (A) BMHC shall notify SBS in writing
at least four Business Days prior to effecting such BMHC Intervening Event
Recommendation Change or BMHC Superior Proposal Termination of its

 



55  intention to effect such BMHC Intervening Event Recommendation Change or
BMHC Superior Proposal Termination (which notice shall, if in connection with
a BMHC Intervening Event, include reasonable detail regarding the BMHC
Intervening Event or, if in connection with a BMHC Superior Proposal
Termination, include the material terms and conditions of such BMHC Superior
Proposal, the identity of the third party, and a copy of the most
recent draft of any written agreement relating thereto (it being understood
and agreed that any material amendment to the terms of such BMHC Superior
Proposal shall require a new notice period as contemplated hereby of at least
three Business Days)), (B) during the applicable notice period contemplated
by clause (A) BMHC shall negotiate with SBS in good faith (to the extent SBS
wishes to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that the BMHC Intervening Event Recommendation Change is
no longer necessary or the BMHC Superior Proposal ceases to be a BMHC Superior
Proposal, as applicable, and (C) at the end of such notice period, the BMHC
Board, taking into consideration any changes to this Agreement offered in
writing by SBS, determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor, that such BMHC Intervening Event
continues to necessitate a BMHC Intervening Event Recommendation Change or
such BMHC Superior Proposal continues to meet the definition of "BMHC Superior
Proposal" if such changes were to be given effect, as applicable, and that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under the Laws of the State of Delaware.

(e) BMHC shall promptly, and in any event within 48 hours of the
receipt thereof, advise SBS orally and in writing of any proposals or offers
with respect to a BMHC Acquisition Proposal (including any request for
nonpublic information from or any discussions or negotiations that are sought
to be initiated or continued with BMHC, the BMHC Board or BMHCs
Representatives with respect to any such SBS Acquisition Proposal), a copy of
(or, if oral, a summary of the material terms and conditions of) any such BMHC
Acquisition Proposal (including any material changes thereto) and the
identity of the Person making any such BMHC Acquisition Proposal or requesting
information or discussions. BMHC shall (i) keep SBS informed in all material
respects and on a reasonably prompt basis of the status and details
(including any change to the terms thereof) of any matters contemplated by
this _Section 5.03(e)_, and (ii) provide to SBS as soon as practicable after
receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and other
written material exchanged between BMHC or any of its Subsidiaries and any
Person that describes any of the material terms or conditions of any BMHC

ARTICLE VI

 

 _Additional Agreements_

 

Section 6.01 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy/Consent Solicitation
Statement; SBS Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, BMHC and SBS shall jointly prepare a proxy/consent solicitation
statement to be sent to the stockholders of BMHC and SBS relating to the SBS
Stockholders Meeting, the solicitation of the BMHC Stockholder Approval and
the adoption of this Agreement by means of 

 



56  the BMHC Written Consent (together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " _Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement_ "). SBS shall prepare
and cause to be filed with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy/Consent
Solicitation Statement will be included as a prospectus, and SBS shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing. Each
of BMHC and SBS shall furnish all information concerning such Person and its
Affiliates to the other, and provide such other assistance, as may be
reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement, and the
Form S-4 and Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement shall include all
information reasonably requested by such other party to be included therein.
SBS agrees that at the date of mailing to stockholders of BMHC and SBS and at
the time of the SBS Stockholders Meeting, the Proxy/Consent Solicitation
Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and the DGCL. SBS
shall promptly notify BMHC upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Form S-4 or
Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement or for additional information. SBS shall
promptly provide BMHC with copies of all substantive correspondence between
SBS and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand,
with respect to the Form S-4 or Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement. SBS
shall use its reasonable best efforts (with BMHCs assistance) to respond as
promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments from the SEC with respect
to the Form S-4 or Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement. Each of SBS and BMHC
shall cause the definitive Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement to be mailed
to their respective stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the
time the Form S-4 has been declared effective by the SEC. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, prior to filing the Form S-4 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or mailing the Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement (or any amendment
or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of BMHC and SBS (i) shall provide the other an opportunity to
review and comment on such document or response (including the proposed final
version of such document or response), (ii) shall include in such document or
response all comments reasonably proposed by the other and (iii) shall not
file or mail such document or respond to the SEC prior to receiving the
approval of the other, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. SBS shall advise BMHC promptly after receipt of
notice thereof, of the time of effectiveness of the Form S-4, the issuance of
any stop order relating thereto or the suspension of the qualification of the
Merger Consideration for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, and SBS
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any such stop order or
suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. Prior to the effective
date of the Form S-4, SBS shall also take any other action (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified) required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act,
any applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder in connection with the Merger and the issuance of
the Merger Consideration.

(b) If, prior to the Effective Time, any event occurs with respect to SBS
or BMHC (or any of their respective Subsidiaries), or any change occurs with
respect to other information supplied by SBS or BMHC for inclusion in the
Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement or the Form S-4, which is required to be
described in an amendment of, or a supplement to, the Proxy/Consent
Solicitation Statement or the Form S-4, SBS or BMHC, as applicable, shall
promptly notify the other party of such event, and SBS and BMHC shall 

 



57  cooperate in the prompt filing with the SEC of any necessary amendment or
supplement to the Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement or the Form S-4 and, as
required by Law, in disseminating the information contained in such amendment
or supplement to their respective stockholders. Nothing in this Section
6.01(b) shall limit the obligations of any party under Section 6.01(a).

 

(c) Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Article VIII, SBS
will take, as soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement in
accordance with applicable Law (including the DGCL) and the SBS Certificate,
the SBS By-laws and the rules of Nasdaq, all action necessary to establish a
record date, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the SBS
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of seeking the SBS Stockholder Approval
as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event no later than 40
calendar days after the Form S-4 shall have been declared effective by the
SEC, subject to any delay that may be reasonably necessary to comply with the
rules of Nasdaq and/or Rule 14a-13 under the Exchange Act with respect to the
record date for the SBS Stockholders Meeting). Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.01(c), SBS may postpone or adjourn the SBS
Stockholders Meeting one or more times solely (x) with the consent of BMHC, or
(y) due to the absence of a quorum or, if on a date for which the SBS
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled, SBS has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares of SBS Common Stock to obtain the SBS
Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present; _provided_ that SBS
may not postpone or adjourn the SBS Stockholders Meeting pursuant to
this clause (y) to a date that is more than 30 days after the date for which
the SBS Stockholders Meeting was originally scheduled or ten or fewer Business
Days prior to the End Date, or (z) to allow reasonable additional time for
any supplemental or amended disclosure which the SBS Board has determined in
good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) is necessary under
applicable Law to be disseminated and reviewed by SBSs stockholders.

 

(d) Subject to Section 5.02(c) and SBSs compliance with Section 5.02(d), SBS
agrees that its obligations pursuant to Section 6.01(c) shall not be affected
by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to
SBS of any SBS Acquisition Proposal or by the making of any SBS Recommendation
Change by the SBS Board; _provided_ that, notwithstanding Section 6.01(c), if
the public announcement of an SBS Recommendation Change, the delivery to BMHC
of a notice pursuant to Section 5.02(d)(ii) or the making of any other
disclosure which is determined in good faith by SBS to be necessary under
applicable Law is less than 10 Business Days prior to the SBS Stockholders
Meeting, SBS shall be entitled to postpone or adjourn the SBS Stockholders
Meeting to a date not less than 10 Business Days after such event.

 

(e) Subject to Section 5.02(c) and SBSs compliance with Section 5.02(d), SBS
shall (i) solicit the SBS Stockholder Approval, (ii) through the SBS Board,
recommend to its stockholders adoption by such stockholders of this Agreement
and approval by such stockholders of the Share Issuance and the Stock Plan
Amendment, (iii) include such recommendation in the Proxy/Consent
Solicitation Statement and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all lawful actions to solicit such adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Share Issuance and the Stock Plan Amendment.

58 (a) Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to Article VIII,
promptly after the Form S-4 shall have been declared effective under the
Securities Act by the SEC, and in any event no later than two Business Days
thereafter, BMHC shall obtain and deliver to SBS the BMHC Written Consent in
lieu of a meeting pursuant to Section 228 of the DGCL for purposes of
adopting this Agreement and approving the Merger and all other transactions
contemplated hereby. The BMHC Written Consent shall be in a form reasonably
satisfactory to SBS.

 

(b) Subject to Section 5.03(c) and BMHCs compliance with Section 5.03(d),
BMHC agrees that its obligations pursuant to Section 6.02(a) shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to BMHC of any BMHC Acquisition Proposal.

BMHC shall (i) solicit the BMHC Stockholder Approval, (ii) through the BMHC
Board, recommend to its stockholders adoption by such stockholders of this
Agreement, (iii) include such recommendation in the Proxy/Consent Solicitation
Statement and (iv) use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all lawful actions to solicit such adoption of this Agreement.

Section 6.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, upon reasonable prior notice, each of SBS and BMHC shall, and shall cause
each of its respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the
Representatives of such other party reasonable access during the period prior
to the Effective Time to all their respective properties, Tax-related
materials, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, each of SBS and BMHC shall, and shall cause each of
its respective Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to the other party (a) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities Laws (other than those that are publicly available in the SECs
EDGAR system) and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably request;
_provided_ that either party may withhold any document or information (i)
that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party
( _provided_ that the withholding party shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the required consent of such third party to such access or
disclosure), (ii) that is subject to any attorney-client privilege (
_provided_ that the withholding party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much of it as possible)
in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege) or
(iii) if providing such access or disclosing such information would violate
applicable Law (including antitrust and privacy Laws). If any material
is withheld by such party pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence,
such party shall inform the other party as to the general nature of what is
being withheld. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall
be subject to the confidentiality agreement dated September 19, 2014, between
SBS and BMHC (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

Section 6.04 _Required Actions_. (a) Each of the parties shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things reasonably appropriate to consummate and make
effective, as soon as reasonably possible, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the
obtaining of all necessary or

 



59  advisable actions or non-actions, waivers and consents from, the making of
all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with and the taking of
all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid a Proceeding by any
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the Merger and (ii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the generality of Section 6.04(a),
each of SBS and BMHC shall:

 

(i) furnish to the other party such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may request in connection with its preparation
of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR Act;

(ii) make or cause to be made as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in
any event no later than ten Business Days following the date of this
Agreement), in consultation and cooperation with the other, all filings
required under the HSR Act relating to the Merger; and 

(iii) subject to applicable Laws relating to the sharing of information, in
connection with obtaining or making all authorizations, consents, orders,
approvals or filings that are or may become necessary, proper or advisable to
be obtained or made to consummate the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of BMHC and SBS shall, and shall cause
their respective Subsidiaries to, promptly notify each other of any
communication it receives from any Governmental Entity and permit the other
party to review in advance any proposed communication by such party to any
Governmental Entity and shall provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between such party or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of
the staff of any Governmental Entity, on the other hand, in each case to the
extent relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement.

(c) In connection with the efforts to obtain all requisite approvals,
clearances and authorizations for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, SBS and BMHC shall
jointly direct strategy in connection with all matters relating to obtaining
clearances and approvals from Governmental Entities and the expiration of
waiting periods. Neither SBS nor BMHC shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries not to, agree to participate in any meeting with
any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement unless it consults with the other party hereto in advance and, to
the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Entity, gives the other
party hereto the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Each
of BMHC and SBS may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under
this Section 6.04 as "outside counsel only." Such competitively sensitive
material and the information contained therein shall be given only to the
outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers or directors of the recipient unless
express permission is obtained in advance from BMHC or SBS, as the case may
be, or its legal counsel.

 



60 (d) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, BMHC and SBS shall
cooperate in good faith to seek to obtain all consents, approvals and waivers
required by the terms of any material Contracts with third parties or material
Permits in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

SBS, of (i) of any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is
or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to BMHC, SBS or the
Combined Company, (ii) of any claims or Proceedings commenced or, to such
partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or otherwise affecting
such party of any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) if such party becomes aware of any
facts or circumstances that such party believes, or with the passage of time
are reasonably likely to, constitute a material breach of this Agreement by
the other party.

(f) Neither party hereto nor their respective Subsidiaries shall be required
by this Section 6.04 to, and neither the party hereto nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, without the prior written consent of the other party
(which may be withheld in its sole discretion) in order to comply with this
Section 6.04 (i) sell, divest, lease, license, transfer, dispose of or
otherwise encumber or hold separate, whether before or after the Effective
Time, any of its assets, entities, licenses, operations, rights, product
lines, businesses or interest therein (or agree or consent to any of the
foregoing actions), (ii) enter into any hold-separate or similar agreements,
orders or decrees or (iii) change, restrict or impair, or agree to commit to
any change or restriction on or other impairment of (A) the ability of a party
or its Subsidiaries to own or operate any of their respective assets,
licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or interests
therein or (B) the Surviving Corporations ability to vote, transfer, receive
dividends or otherwise exercise full ownership rights with respect to the
capital stock of its Subsidiaries that, in the case of any of the foregoing,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Combined Company.

Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt such resolutions
as are necessary to effect the following:

 

(i) adjust the terms of all outstanding BMHC Time-Vesting Restricted Stock
Units as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time, each BMHC Time-
Vesting Restricted Stock Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award with respect to
that number of shares of SBS Common Stock, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such BMHC Time-Vesting Restricted Stock
Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any acceleration of
vesting in connection with the consummation of the Merger), determined by
multiplying each BMHC Time-Vesting Restricted Stock Unit by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole share (a " _Converted SBS Time-Vesting
Restricted Stock Unit_ "); and

 



61 (ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding BMHC Performance-Vesting
Restricted Stock Units as necessary to provide that, at the Effective Time,
(x) the performance-based vesting conditions in respect of each outstanding
BMHC Performance-Vesting Restricted Stock Units shall be deemed satisfied at
maximum, (y) each award of BMHC Performance-Vesting Restricted Stock Unit
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a
restricted stock unit award with respect to that number of shares of SBS
Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions (other than the terms and
conditions relating to the achievement of performance goals) determined by

account the level of achievement of applicable performance goals as
determined pursuant to clause (x) above) by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole share (a " _Converted SBS Performance-Vesting Restricted
Stock Unit_ "), provided that the vesting criteria applicable to
such Converted SBS Performance-Vesting Restricted Stock Unit shall provide
for solely service-based vesting.

(b) At the Effective Time, SBS shall assume all the obligations of BMHC under
the BMHC Stock Plans, each Converted SBS Time-Vesting Restricted Stock Unit
and Converted SBS Performance-Vesting Restricted Stock Unit and the agreements
evidencing the grants thereof. As soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, SBS shall deliver to the holders of Converted SBS Time-Vesting
Restricted Stock Units and Converted SBS Performance-Vesting Restricted Stock
Units appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights, and the
agreements evidencing the grants of such Converted SBS Time-Vesting Restricted
Stock Units and Converted SBS Performance-Vesting Restricted Stock Units in
effect at the Effective Time (subject to the adjustments required by
this Section 6.05 after giving effect to the Merger) shall continue in
effect.

(c) SBS shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of SBS Common Stock for delivery upon exercise or
vesting of the Converted SBS Time-Vesting Restricted Stock Units and Converted

Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement to the stockholders of SBS, SBS shall
adopt an amendment to the SBS Stock Plan (the " _Stock Plan Amendment_
") increasing the number of shares of SBS Common Stock reserved for issuance
thereunder in an amount equal to the sum of (i) the number of shares of SBS
Common Stock subject to all Converted SBS Time-Vesting Restricted Stock Units
and Converted SBS Performance-Vesting Restricted Stock Units and (ii) such
number of shares of SBS Common Stock, as determined in good faith by SBS and
BMHC, as necessary to provide for new equity award grants to employees of the
Combined Company for the three-year period following the Closing Date. SBS
shall submit the Stock Plan Amendment to SBSs stockholders for approval at
the SBS Stockholders Meeting, and the SBS Board shall recommend the Stock Plan
Amendment for approval at such SBS Stockholders Meeting.

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, SBS shall file
a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate
form) with respect to the shares of SBS Common Stock subject to Converted SBS
Time-Vesting Restricted Stock Units and Converted SBS Performance-Vesting
Restricted Stock Units and shall maintain the effectiveness of such

62  status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such Converted SBS Time-Vesting Restricted Stock Units and Converted SBS
Performance-Vesting Restricted Stock Units remain outstanding.

SBS By-laws or the BMHC Certificate and the BMHC By-laws, as applicable, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals
until the expiration of the statutes of limitations applicable to such matters
or unless such amendment, modification or repeal is required by applicable
Law.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall indemnify
and hold harmless each officer and director of SBS, BMHC or of any of their
respective Subsidiaries (as of or prior to the Effective Time) (each, together

Party_ " and collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against all
claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts
paid in settlement and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent of SBS, BMHC or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, or of another entity if such service
was at the request of SBS or BMHC, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent the Surviving Company is
permitted to do so under applicable Law. In the event of any such Proceeding,
each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in
the defense of the Proceeding from the Surviving Company ( _provided_ that,
if required by applicable Law, any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced shall have provided an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
finally determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification).

 

(c) SBS shall purchase prior to the Effective Time, and, for a period of six
years following the Effective Time, the Surviving Company shall maintain, a
fully pre-paid six-year tail policy to the current directors and officers
liability insurance policies maintained on the date of this Agreement by BMHC
for an aggregate cost of no more than $800,000 (exclusive of any
premium refund on existing BMHC coverage), which tail policy will cover a
period from the Effective Time through and including the date that is six
years after the Closing Date with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective Time, and which
tail policy shall contain the same coverage and amount as, and contain terms
and conditions that are equivalent to the coverage currently provided by the
existing policies of BMHC (complete and accurate copies of which shall have
been made available to SBS before such purchase).

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
other assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision

incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such transactions
are consummated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SBS and BMHC each shall pay
50% of (i) any expenses (excluding each partys internal costs and expenses of

of the printing and mailing of the Proxy/Consent Solicitation Statement, and
(ii) any and all filing fees due in connection with the filings required by or

terms of the transactions contemplated hereunder. Each of BMHC and SBS will
report the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
a manner consistent with such qualification.

(b) BMHC and SBS shall each use its reasonable best efforts in connection with

reasonably be requested by such law firm, including at the time the Form S-4

action reasonably appropriate to ensure that no state takeover statute,
including Section 203 of the DGCL, or similar statute or regulation (or any
similar provision in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of BMHC or
SBS) is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if any state takeover statute,
including Section 203 of the DGCL, or similar statute or regulation (or any
similar provision in the certificate of incorporation or by-laws of BMHC or
SBS) becomes applicable to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _Termination, Amendment and Waiver_

to the Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the SBS Stockholder
Approval or the BMHC Stockholder Approval:

(a) by mutual written consent of BMHC and SBS;

 

(b) by either BMHC or SBS:

 



70 (i) if the Merger is not consummated on or before December 31, 2015 (the "
_End Date_ "); _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party if such failure of
the Merger to be consummated on or before the End Date is primarily the
result of the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform in any material respect any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 

(ii) if the condition set forth in Section 7.01(d) is not satisfied and the
Legal Restraint giving rise to such non-satisfaction shall have become final
and non-appealable; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.02(b) shall not be available to any party if the
Legal Restraints having become final and non-appealable was primarily due to
the failure of such party to perform in any material respect any of its
obligations under this Agreement;

 

(iii) if the SBS Stockholder Approval is not obtained at the SBS Stockholders
Meeting duly convened (unless such SBS Stockholders Meeting has been
adjourned, in which case at the final adjournment thereof);

(c) by BMHC, if SBS breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or
warranties of SBS contained herein fails to be true and correct, which breach
or failure (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b) and (ii) is not reasonably capable of being cured
by the End Date or, if reasonably capable of being cured, shall not have been
cured (A) within 30 days following receipt of written notice from BMHC of

the date BMHC provides written notice of such breach or failure and the End

Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(c) if it is then in material breach of
any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or if any of the
representations or warranties of BMHC contained herein then fails to be true
and correct, which breach or failure would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b);

(d) by SBS, if BMHC breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or
warranties of BMHC contained herein fails to be true and correct, which breach
or failure (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) and (ii) is not reasonably capable of being cured
by the End Date or, if reasonably capable of being cured, shall not have been
cured (A) within 30 days following receipt of written notice from SBS of such
breach or failure or (B) any shorter period of time that remains between the
date SBS provides written notice of such breach or failure and the End Date;
_provided_ that SBS shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.01(d) if it is then in material breach of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, or if any of the
representations or warranties of SBS contained herein then fails to be true
and correct, which breach or failure would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Section 7.02(a) or 7.02(b);

 

(e) by SBS, prior to the time at which the BMHC Stockholder Approval has been
obtained, if the BMHC Written Consent shall not have been obtained pursuant
to Section

 



71  6.02(a) within five Business Days after the date the Form S-4 shall have

Days are specified. If any period expires on a day which is not a Business Day
or any event or condition is required by the terms of this Agreement to occur
or be fulfilled on a day which is not a Business Day, such period shall
expire or such event or condition shall occur or be fulfilled, as the case may
be, on the next succeeding Business Day. Any action required to be taken
"within" a specified time period following the occurrence of an event shall
be required to be taken by no later than 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the
last day of such time period, which shall be calculated starting

 



81  with the day immediately following the date of the event. Unless otherwise
specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" and "$" will be deemed
references to United States dollars.

Section 9.06 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability. Upon a determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 9.07 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. (a) This
Agreement, taken together with the SBS Disclosure Letter and the BMHC
Disclosure Letter, the Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement,
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) This Agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other
Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than with respect to the provisions of Section
6.05 (of which each Indemnified Party is an intended beneficiary following
the Effective Time). Except as set forth in this Section 9.07(b), nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any Person
other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

Section 9.08 _Governing Law and Venue_. (a) This Agreement shall be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under any applicable
principles of conflicts of laws of the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Each party hereto irrevocably agrees that it shall bring any Proceeding in
respect of any claim arising out of, related to or based on this Agreement or
the transactions contained in or contemplated by this Agreement exclusively in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or to the extent such court
does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of
Delaware or any federal court located in the State of Delaware (collectively,
the " _Chosen Courts_ ") and solely in connection with claims arising under,
related to or based on this Agreement or the transactions that are the
subject of this Agreement (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue
in any such Proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that
the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over
any party hereto and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in
any such Proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
Section 9.03.

 

Section 9.09 _Obligations of the Parties_. Whenever this Agreement requires a
Subsidiary of a party hereto to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an

 



82  undertaking on the part of such party (and, after the Effective Time, on the
part of the Surviving Company) to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

Section 9.10 _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto have participated jointly
in negotiating and drafting this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or
a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be
construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto by
virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 9.11 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment
without such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this
Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.12 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties acknowledge
and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article
VIII, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of
terms and provisions of this Agreement in any of the Chosen Courts without
proof of actual damages (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for
any such breach.

Section 9.13  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in
the event of any Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waiver and
certifications in this Section 9.13.

 

Section 9.14 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.
