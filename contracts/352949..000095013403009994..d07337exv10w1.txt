collectively as the "Excluded Liabilities"), regardless of whether such other
Liability is disclosed herein or on any Schedule hereto, which Excluded
Liabilities shall remain the sole responsibility of and shall be retained,
paid, performed and discharged solely by Sellers. The Excluded Liabilities
include, without limitation, the following:   (a) Excluded Assets. All

Acquired Assets.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions in this
Agreement, including the other provisions of this Section 2.5, Purchaser
shall have the right (the "Option Rights"), in its discretion, from the date
hereof until the six (6) month anniversary of the Initial Closing (the
"Option Period") to specifically include or exclude those Acquired Assets
(except Inventory) to be assigned to it as it shall specify in an Option
Notice to Sellers, whereupon such Acquired Assets shall, to the extent
excluded, cease to be "Acquired Assets" hereunder and shall become "Excluded
Assets" and thereby be excluded from the Acquired Assets; provided that such
exclusions shall not result in a Purchase Price adjustment; provided,
further, to the extent that Purchaser has delivered an Option Notice prior to
the 15th day immediately preceding the expiration of such six (6) month
period in accordance with this Section 2.5, the Option Period shall continue
for such time as is necessary to seek and obtain any necessary Supplemental
Sales Orders with respect to the Acquired Assets identified in any such
Option Notices, so long as and to the extent that the Purchaser remains
obligated under the Transition Services Agreement for the Liabilities
associated with any such identified Acquired Assets.   (b) Consequently,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary:   (i) title to
all Acquired Assets that constitute Inventory and other Acquired Assets which
Purchaser acquires at the Initial Closing shall pass to Purchaser at the
Initial Closing;   (ii) during the Option Period, title to the
Acquired Assets (other than Inventory and other Acquired Assets which
Purchaser acquired at the Initial Closing or subsequent to the Initial
Closing pursuant to this Section 2.5) shall not pass to Purchaser, unless, at
any time prior to the 15th day immediately preceding the expiration of the
Option Period, Purchaser provides an Option Notice to Sellers that Purchaser
is exercising its Option Rights to purchase all or a portion of the Acquired
Assets;   (iii) during the Option Period, title to all or a portion of the
Acquired Assets shall not pass to Purchaser, if at any time prior to the 15th
day immediately preceding the expiration of the Option Period, Purchaser
provides an Option Notice to Sellers that Purchaser is exercising its Option
Rights to exclude all or a portion of the Acquired Assets;   (iv) if on or
prior to the expiration of the Option Period, Purchaser indicates its desire
to either purchase or exclude a PSC in accordance with paragraphs (i), (ii)
or (iii) above, then any Owned Real Property or leased real property upon
which a PSC is situated or reasonably adjacent to such PSC shall also be
concurrently purchased or excluded, as applicable; and   (v) if Purchaser
fails to deliver an Option Notice prior to the 15th day immediately preceding
the expiration of the Option Period with respect to any portion of the
Acquired Assets, except for Acquired Contracts (the "Undesignated Assets"),
those Undesignated Assets shall be assigned to Purchaser and title shall pass
in accordance with this     21    Agreement at the end of the Option
Period. In the event that Purchaser fails to deliver an Option Notice prior
to the 15th day immediately preceding the expiration of the Option Period
with respect to an Acquired Contract (each such Acquired Contract, an
"Undesignated Acquired Contract"), title to such Acquired Contract shall not
pass to Purchaser but shall instead cease to be an "Acquired Asset" hereunder
and shall become an "Excluded Asset" for purposes of this Agreement.   (c)
For purposes of this Agreement, an "Option Notice" shall be a written notice
delivered by Purchaser to Sellers specifying or otherwise providing (i)
Purchaser\'s exercise of its Option Rights to either purchase all or a
portion of the Acquired Assets or exclude all or a portion of the
Acquired Assets, as the case may be, (ii) a description, in reasonably
sufficient detail, of the Acquired Assets to be purchased or excluded, as the
case may be, including, without limitation, lists of any Acquired Contracts
to be purchased or excluded, as the case may be, and (iii) the expected
timing of the consummation of such purchase or exclusion, as the case may be
(which in no event shall be earlier than thirty (30) days following the
delivery of such Option Notice, or, if given on or prior to the date of the
Business Day immediately following the Auction, no earlier than the Initial
Closing). All Option Notices once delivered shall be irrevocable. Purchaser
shall deliver Option Notices (on one or more occasions) notifying Sellers of
Purchaser\'s determination to purchase or exclude any Acquired Assets, as the
case may be, as soon as reasonably practicable after Purchaser has made any
such determination; provided, that in no event shall an Option Notice be
delivered later than fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of the Option
Period.   (d) As soon as practicable after receipt of an Option Notice that
Purchaser is exercising its Option Rights to purchase and retain all or
a portion of the Acquired Assets or Purchaser fails to deliver an Option
Notice with respect to any portion of the Acquired Assets (excluding
Acquired Contracts) as set forth in Section 2.5(b)(v), Sellers shall file,
duly serve and diligently prosecute a motion in the Bankruptcy Court seeking
authorization, as necessary, to assume and assign any (i) specified Acquired
Assets, as the case may be, or otherwise transfer any specified Acquired
Assets, as the case may be, to Purchaser (any Orders, approving the matters
set forth in such motion referred to herein as the "Supplemental Sales
Orders"); provided, however, Sellers shall not be required to file more than
one (1) such motion per each thirty (30) day period. Upon receipt of any
approval, if necessary, of the Bankruptcy Court, the parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate such purchase (each such
consummation, a "Subsequent Closing") by no later than the end of the
expiration of the Option Period and, pursuant to Section 3.5, Sellers shall
execute and deliver such documents and instruments of conveyance and transfer
as Purchaser may reasonably request in order to consummate the purchase and
sale of the specified Acquired Assets and to vest title to such Acquired
Assets. The date of consummation of each such purchase shall be referred to
as a "Subsequent Closing Date".   (e) In accordance with Section 2.3 above,
Purchaser shall be responsible for all Liabilities associated with an
Acquired Asset arising on and after the date that the such Acquired Asset is
assigned, transferred and delivered to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.
Sellers shall have three (3) Business Days after receipt of an Option Notice
announcing Purchaser\'s election to exclude all or a portion of the Acquired
Assets, and shall have three (3) Business Days after the 15th day immediately
preceding the expiration of the Option Period with     22    respect
to Undesignated Acquired Contracts, to notify Purchaser whether
Sellers intend to reject such specified Acquired Assets. In the event Sellers
decide to reject any specified Acquired Assets, promptly following the
expiration of such three (3) Business Day period, Sellers shall file, duly
serve and diligently prosecute a motion in the Bankruptcy Court seeking
authorization, as necessary, to reject such specified Acquired Assets,
including Acquired Contracts. In addition, upon receipt of any such Option
Notice to exclude all or a portion of the Acquired Assets, or promptly after
the 15th day immediately preceding the expiration of the Option Period with
respect to an Undesignated Acquired Contract, Sellers and Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate such exclusion by no later than
the end of the expiration of the Option Period and Purchaser shall execute
and deliver such documents, if necessary, as Seller may reasonably request in
order to effectuate the exclusion of any such Acquired Assets.   (f)
[INTENTIONALLY DELETED].   (g) To the extent Purchaser exercises its Option
Rights on or prior to the later of the close of business on the date of the
Sale Hearing or seven days prior to the Initial Closing, to exclude any
portion of the Acquired Assets pursuant to Section 2.5 above, notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall not be liable or
responsible for, and shall not be required to reimburse Sellers and their
Affiliates for, any Liabilities of Sellers and their Affiliates relating to
such Acquired Assets. To the extent Purchaser exercises its Option Rights
after the later of the close of business on the date of the Sale Hearing or
seven days prior to the Initial Closing to exclude any portion of the
Acquired Assets pursuant to this Section 2.5 above, notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers for all
liabilities incurred under the related Acquired Contracts on or after the
Initial Closing, until such time as Sellers, in the exercise of their
commercially reasonable efforts, can terminate or otherwise reject such
Acquired Contracts, so long as Sellers file, duly serve and are diligently
prosecuting a motion in the Bankruptcy Court seeking authorization, as
necessary, to reject such specified Acquired Contracts.   2.6 Designation
Rights; Assignment and Transfer of Acquired Assets.   (a) Purchaser shall
have the right (the "Designation Rights") to assign its rights and
obligations hereunder with respect to any Acquired Assets to one or more
third parties (each, a "Third Party Purchaser") so long as Purchaser causes
each Third Party Purchaser to comply with the provisions in this Section 2.6.
Purchaser may, by one or more notices (each, a "Third Party Purchaser
Notice") to Sellers, designate one or more Third Party Purchasers and the
Acquired Assets to be transferred to each such Third Party
Purchaser. Purchaser may deliver a Third Party Purchaser Notice to Seller
from the date hereof and up to fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration of
the Option Period (the "Assignment Deadline").   (b) As soon as practicable
after the receipt of each Third Party Purchaser Notice, Sellers shall file,
duly serve and diligently prosecute a motion in the Bankruptcy Court seeking
authorization, as necessary, to assume and assign any designated Lease or
Contract which is an Acquired Contract or otherwise transfer any designated
Acquired Assets to the Third Party Purchaser.     23    (c) Between the
date hereof and the Initial Closing, Sellers shall (i) afford any such Third
Party Purchaser and its authorized representatives reasonable access to all
offices and other facilities, all books and records and all employees and
personnel of Sellers relating to the Business, (B) permit such Third Party
Purchaser and its authorized representatives to make such inspections and to
make copies of such books and records relating to the Business as they may
reasonably require and (C) furnish such Third Party Purchaser and its
authorized representatives with such financial and operating data and other
information and other information concerning the Business as they may from
time to time reasonably request. Sellers will direct their employees
to render any assistance which such Third Party Purchaser may reasonably
request in examining or utilizing records referred to in this Section
2.6(c).   (d) Any Third Party Purchaser and its authorized representatives
(including its designated engineers or consultants) may, upon reasonable
notice during normal business hours, enter into and upon any PSC or any
portion of the Owned Real Property (unless such PSC or portion of Owned
Real Property is no longer an Acquired Asset pursuant to this Agreement) in
order to assess the environmental condition of such properties or the
business conducted thereat. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no soil and
surface or ground water sampling, monitoring, borings or testing and any
other invasive tests or investigations relating to environmental conditions
or at such properties shall be conducted (i) without Sellers\' consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; (ii) without permitting Sellers
the opportunity to participate therein; and (iii) such Third Party Purchaser
agrees to repair any damage to any applicable PSC or portion of the Owned
Real Property due to such investigation and to indemnify and hold Sellers
harmless of and from any claim for physical damages or physical injuries
arising from such Third Party Purchaser\'s investigation of such PSC or
portion of the Owned Real Property, and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, such indemnity shall survive the transfer,
assignment and delivery of such PSC or portion of Owned Real Property
pursuant to this Agreement for a period of one year after such transfer or,
if such sale is not consummated, either the termination of this Agreement or
the one year anniversary of the Initial Closing. Sellers shall cooperate with
such Third Party Purchaser and its authorized representatives in conducting
such assessment, and shall allow such Third Party Purchaser and
its authorized representatives reasonable access to their properties and
businesses.   (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
including paragraphs (c) and (d) above, (i) Purchaser shall provide written
notification to Seller of the identity of any prospective Third Party
Purchaser concurrently with or prior to Purchaser\'s execution of a
confidentiality agreement relating to any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with such Third Party Purchaser (with copies of such
confidentiality agreements to be provided to Sellers promptly upon execution
thereof), and Purchaser shall cause Sellers to be third party beneficiaries
to all such confidentiality agreements and (ii) to the extent any such Third
Party Purchaser is given physical access to any facilities of the Business,
Purchaser shall cause such Third Party Purchaser to be accompanied by one or
more employees or representatives of Purchaser.   (f) In order to facilitate
the acquisition of Acquired Assets by one or more Third Party Purchasers,
Sellers shall, if requested by Purchaser, execute one or more necessary
transfer documents or amendments to this Agreement (each in a form reasonably
acceptable to Sellers) making such Third Party Purchasers parties hereto in
respect of a portion of the     24   Acquired Assets and permitting
such Third Party Purchasers to assume all rights, obligations and interests
of Purchaser under this Agreement in respect of such Acquired Assets, all
subject to any further required order of the Bankruptcy Court. Purchaser and
Parent shall, if necessary, execute such documents and/or otherwise cause
such documents to be executed by such Third Party Purchaser (which shall in
any event be consistent with the terms hereof and on terms no less favorable
to Sellers as this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
Purchaser enters into agreements with Third Party Purchasers incorporating or
otherwise containing any representations and warranties of such Third Party
Purchaser, Purchaser agrees that Sellers shall be included as third party
beneficiaries to such agreements or, to the extent not so included as third
party beneficiaries, shall have direct recourse against Purchaser for breach
of the representations and warranties set forth therein by such Third Party
Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall not
be responsible for and Purchaser shall otherwise reimburse Sellers for
all filings fees associated with notifications and filings under the HSR Act
which may be required in respect of transactions with any Third Party
Purchasers.   (g) Subject to terms of this Agreement, including Section
2.5, on the Assignment Deadline, all Acquired Assets (excluding Acquired
Contracts, which shall not be transferred to Purchaser) not theretofore
assigned or transferred to a Third Party Purchaser or Purchaser or designated
for transfer to a Third Party Purchaser in a timely delivered Third Party
Purchaser Notice shall be transferred to Purchaser.   (h) Subject to
Section 14.11, nothing in this Section 2.6 shall relieve Purchaser of its
obligations hereunder with respect to the payment of the Purchase Price or
its obligations with respect to any Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities
that are not transferred to Third Party Purchasers.   (i) Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser may exercise its Designation
Rights to designate Third Party Purchasers pre-Initial Closing that Purchaser
intends will purchase designated Acquired Assets directly from Sellers
concurrently with the Initial Closing of the Acquired Assets by Purchaser,
but only to the extent such transactions with the Third Party Purchasers are
able to close and do close concurrently with the Initial Closing of the
Acquired Assets by Purchaser. In the event any of such proposed transactions
with any of the Third Party Purchasers for the purchase of any portion of the
Acquired Assets (the "Non-Concurrent Portion") are unable to close
concurrently with the Initial Closing of the Acquired Assets by
Purchaser, Purchaser shall not delay the Initial Closing on account of the
Non-Concurrent Portion and shall be responsible for the entire Purchase
Price.   2.7 Collection of Receivables and Notes.   (a) In the event that
after the Initial Closing, Purchaser receives any payment at any PSC or
otherwise in respect of any accounts or trade receivables that accrued prior
to the Initial Closing Date, Purchaser shall segregate such payment from its
own assets and shall, within five (5) Business Days of receipt of funds by
Purchaser, remit the same to Sellers. Any such payment shall at all times
remain the property of Sellers, and Purchaser acknowledges that it has no
rights or interests with respect thereto.     25    (b) Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall retain and control all
accounts and trade receivables, and any security interests or guarantees
related thereto (subject to Section 2.11), that accrued prior to the Initial
Closing Date; provided, that nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting
Sellers from seeking any legal recourse available to them against any
customers for the collection of such accounts and trade receivables.   (c)
With respect to promissory notes, forgiveness notes, facility standby
agreement notes and facility standby agreement accounts receivable:   (i)
to the extent such notes relate to the Operating PSCs, Sellers shall not, in
attempting to collect upon any amounts due thereon (whether or not in
arrears), reduce the principal amount of any such notes or otherwise extend
the maturity date, reduce the interest rate or extend any amortization or
interest payment (collectively "compromise such notes") without the prior
written consent of Purchaser; and   (ii) to the extent such notes relate to
the Non-Operating PSCs, Sellers shall not, in attempting to collect any
amounts due thereon (whether or not in arrears), reduce that portion of the
principal amount that would otherwise be payable on and after the Initial
Closing Date in respect of such notes or otherwise compromise such notes,
unless Sellers remit to Purchaser by the close of business on the Initial
Closing Date (the "Purchaser Collection Amount") a portion of any amounts
collected as a result of such reduction (the "Collection Amount"), with
Sellers entitled to retain an amount equal to the Collection Amount
multiplied by a fraction, (x) the numerator of which shall be the amount of
all regularly scheduled principal due and owing (and any interest thereon)
from Third Parties through the Initial Closing Date and (y) the denominator
of which shall be (A) the amount of the numerator plus (B) the principal due
after the Initial Closing Date, and Purchaser is entitled to the remainder of
the Collection Amount; provided, however, that without the prior consent of
Purchaser, Sellers shall not agree to or effect any reduction with respect to
any such note if such note is with a customer (or Affiliate of such customer)
that also then has obligations under a promissory note, forgiveness note or
facility standby agreement note relating to an Operating PSC. At the election
of Purchaser, Purchaser may deduct from the Purchase Price it delivers to
Sellers at the Initial Closing an amount of funds equal to the sum of all
Purchaser Collection Amounts owed to Purchaser pursuant to this Section
2.7.   (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 2.7, on and after the Initial Closing, Sellers will not reduce
or otherwise compromise the principal amount of any promissory notes,
forgiveness notes, facility standby agreement notes and facility standby
agreement accounts receivable which are not Excluded Assets.   (e) To the
extent requested by Sellers, Purchaser shall reasonably assist Sellers in the
collection of such accounts and trade receivables from customers that are
being supplied by Purchaser, provided that any such assistance shall not
unreasonably interfere with Purchaser\'s supply relationship with such
customer. To the extent requested by Purchaser, Sellers shall reasonably
assist Purchaser in the collection of amounts due and owing from Third
Parties following the Initial Closing Date in respect of Acquired Contracts,
including customer forgiveness notes and customer promissory notes.    
26    (f) In the event that after the Initial Closing, Sellers receive any
payment in respect of any accounts or trade receivables that accrued after
the Initial Closing Date with respect to any Acquired Assets leased by
or otherwise used for the benefit of Purchaser pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement or any Acquired Assets which have been assigned,
transferred and delivered pursuant to this Agreement, Sellers shall segregate
such payment from their own assets and shall, within five (5) Business Days
of receipt of funds by Sellers, remit the same to Purchaser within a
reasonable period of time after the receipt thereof without. Any such payment
shall at all times remain the property of Purchaser, and Sellers acknowledge
that they have no rights or interests with respect thereto.   2.8 Deemed
Consents and Cures. For all purposes of this Agreement (including all
representations and warranties of Sellers contained herein), subject to
Section 2.10, Sellers shall be deemed to have obtained all required consents,
as applicable, in respect of the assignment of any Acquired Contract and to
have cured all defaults thereunder if, and to the extent that, pursuant to
the Sale Order or another Order of the Bankruptcy Court, Sellers
are authorized to assume and assign any such Acquired Contracts to
Purchaser pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code; provided, however,
nothing in this Section 2.8 shall relieve Sellers of their obligations to pay
Cure Costs in accordance with Section 2.9 below.   2.9 Cure Costs.   (a)
To the extent that any Acquired Contract is subject to a cure (pursuant to
section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and described in the Sale Order or any
Order of the Bankruptcy Court relating to such cure Liability), Sellers shall
be responsible for any such cure (in the aggregate the "Cure Costs");
provided, however, Sellers shall not be responsible for any material Cure
Costs associated with Acquired Contracts that are not essential to
the Business and are readily replicated with other Third Parties. In
addition, from the date hereof until July 16, 2003, with the consent of
Purchaser, Sellers may designate Acquired Contracts which are not necessary
for the on-going operations of the Business, for which Sellers shall not be
responsible for any Cure Costs.   (b) On the Initial Closing Date,
Purchaser, on behalf of the Sellers, shall deposit into escrow (the "Cure
Escrow") the Cure Escrow Amount. Subject to paragraph (a) above, with respect
to each Acquired Contract, Sellers shall pay, as soon as practicable
following the Initial Closing Date or applicable Subsequent Closing Date, as
the case may be, all Cure Costs that are required to be paid with respect to
such Acquired Contract pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and
described in the Sale Order or any Order of the Bankruptcy Court relating to
such cure Liability; provided, however, that Cure Costs that are the subject
of a bona fide dispute shall be paid within five Business Days of the
effectiveness of a settlement or Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court
resolving such disputes, as the case may be. Such Cure Costs shall be payable
from the Cure Escrow upon written instructions from Sellers to the applicable
escrow agent, with Purchaser to join and acknowledge such
written instructions. The Purchaser shall not be permitted to direct the Cure
Escrow Agent to make any cure payment and shall not be permitted to deduct
from the Purchase Price payable at the Initial Closing any Cure Costs.  
2.10 Required Consents. Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain all consents required from any Third Party or Governmental entity in
connection with this     27   Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers\' effort to
obtain any such required consents.   2.11 Security Interest and Guarantee
Allocation. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, to
the extent any security interest or guarantee relates to both promissory
notes which are Acquired Assets and accounts and trade receivables which are
Excluded Assets, the parties agree that as between Sellers and Purchaser, the
party (the "Collecting Party") with the related assets which have a greater
outstanding balance shall be entitled to control and exercise collection
remedies against such security interest and/or guarantee; provided, however,
the Collecting Party shall, with respect to any amounts collected from such
security interest and/or guarantee, retain its pro rata portion of such
collection, with such pro rata amount determined by multiplying the
collection amount by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
outstanding balance of such party\'s promissory notes or accounts and
trade receivables, as the case may be, and the denominator shall be the sum
of the outstanding balances of such promissory notes and accounts and
trade receivables, and the Collecting Party shall remit to the other party
the remainder of the collection amount. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, for purposes of determining such security interest and/or
guarantee allocation, the parties shall not include any forgiveness notes or
facility standby agreements and amounts due thereon. To the extent the
Collecting Party is not the "secured party" (as defined in the Uniform
Commercial Code) in respect of any security interest and/or guarantee, the
other party shall provide such authorizations reasonably necessary in order
to permit the Collecting Party to exercise remedies in accordance with this
Section 2.11.   ARTICLE III  PURCHASE PRICE AND PAYMENT   3.1
Consideration.   (a) The total cash consideration to be paid by Purchaser
to Sellers for the Acquired Assets (the "Purchase Price") shall be equal to
(i) seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000), plus (ii) an amount equal to
the Inventory Amount, plus (iii) an amount equal to the Royalty Amount.  
(b) As further consideration for the Acquired Assets, Purchaser shall assume
the Assumed Liabilities.   (c) The Purchase Price shall be payable by wire
transfer as follows:   (i) (x) An initial earnest money deposit in
the amount of five million dollars ($5,000,000) in cash (the "Initial
Deposit") to be paid by Purchaser promptly following the date hereof, but no
later than one (1) Business Day following the execution of the Deposit Escrow
Agreement by all parties thereto, (y) an additional deposit in the amount of
five million dollars ($5,000,000) in cash (the "Second Deposit") to be paid
by Purchaser on July 16, 2003 and (z) a final deposit (the "Final Deposit",
and together with the Initial and Second Deposits and any interest and
earnings thereon, the "Deposit"), in the amount of eight million dollars
($8,000,000) in cash to be paid by Purchaser on the Business Day immediately
preceding the time any Third     28   Party bidder is required to
deliver deposits pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order. The Deposit shall
be deposited into escrow pursuant to the Deposit Escrow Agreement.   (ii)
Seventy-five million dollars ($75,000,000) (the "Fixed Component of Purchase
Price") minus the Deposit of which the Cure Escrow Amount shall be paid
directly to the Cure Escrow Agent, and the remainder of which shall be paid
by Purchaser at the Initial Closing and subject to the adjustment provisions
set forth in Sections 2.7(c), 3.4 and 3.7, in immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by Sellers at least two Business Days prior
to the Initial Closing.   (iii) The Inventory Amount to be paid by Purchaser
at the Initial Closing in immediately available funds to an account
designated by Sellers; provided, however, to the extent the Inventory Amount
payable at the Initial Closing is in excess of $250,000,000, the amount of
such excess shall be payable within 30 days following the Initial Closing
Date.   (iv) The Initial Estimate Payment of the Royalty Amount to be paid
by Purchaser at the Initial Closing in immediately available funds to an
account designated by Sellers.   (v) The Second Estimate Payment of the
Royalty Amount and the remainder of the Royalty Amount to be paid by
Purchaser in accordance with and subject to Section 3.3.   3.2 Computation
of the Inventory Amount.   (a) Sale of Inventory.   (i) The legal title to
the Inventory, except for any Excluded Inventory, shall be transferred to
Purchaser at the Initial Closing pursuant to the Bill of Sale in a form
mutually agreed to by the Parties.   (ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, on or prior to the date which is three Business Days prior to
the Initial Closing Date, Sellers may, in their discretion, exclude (by
written notice to Purchaser) any Inventory as an Acquired Asset, whereupon
such Inventory shall cease to be "Acquired Assets" hereunder and shall become
"Excluded Inventory" and "Excluded Assets." In such event, such Inventory
shall not be counted in determining the Inventory Amount and such Inventory
shall be removed from the Operating PSCs by Sellers within thirty (30) days
following the Initial Closing Date.   (b) Inventory Amount. The "Inventory
Amount" shall be the net landed cost of the Inventory sold to Purchaser
determined in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force statement no. 02-16,
which will therefore be net of any and all promotional, prompt pay and other
allowances and discounts; provided, that all such Inventory shall be in
saleable condition; provided, further, that with respect to Inventory that
Sellers have held over ninety (90) days prior to the Initial Closing Date or
Inventory that is not in saleable condition, the Inventory Amount shall be
reduced by mutual agreement in accordance with the procedures set forth on
Schedule 3.2. For purposes of this Agreement, Inventory shall be in "saleable
condition" if it can be sold     29   without discount, is not out of
code, is not damaged and can be delivered to a customer with a customary and
adequate shelf life.   (c) Inventory Count. A physical count of the
Inventory (other than the Excluded Inventory) shall be made mutually by
Purchaser and Sellers. The parties shall make a physical accounting of the
Inventory (the "Inventory Count") at each Operating PSC on the date which is
ten Business Days prior to the Initial Closing Date or such other time period
mutually agreeable to Purchaser and Sellers (the "Inventory Date"), in
accordance with mutually agreed upon instructions consistent with the
inventory procedures set forth on Schedule 3.2. The parties may have
representatives present and available during the Inventory Count, with such
representatives to assist in the Inventory Count, including documentation
thereof. These representatives will attempt, in good faith, to resolve any
disputes respecting quantity or pricing which may arise during the Inventory
Count. To the extent that the parties or such representatives are unable to
resolve any such disputes, within three (3) Business Days following any such
dispute, the parties shall mutually select an independent accounting firm to
make final, binding determinations with respect to any such disputes within
five (5) Business Days following such selection. The cost of such mutually
selected independent accounting firm shall be borne equally by the parties.
With respect to any Operating PSC for which the Inventory Date precedes the
close of business on the day before the Initial Closing Date, the portion of
the Inventory Amount related to such Operating PSC shall be determined on the
basis of the value of the Inventory (determined in accordance with Schedule
3.2 to be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto prior to July 14, 2003),
adjusted for sales and purchases of inventory between the Inventory Date and
the Initial Closing Date based on purchase and sales records of the Sellers,
as mutually agreed between Purchaser and Sellers.   (d) Inventory Amount
Documentation. The representatives shall provide to the applicable party a
report that lists the inventory information of the type set forth on Schedule
3.2(d) (which schedule will be mutually agreed upon by the parties hereto
prior to July 14, 2003) for each Operating PSC at the conclusion of the
Inventory Count for a particular Operating PSC, which documentation shall be
used by the parties to calculate the Inventory Amount. The Inventory Amount
shall be payable in accordance with Section 3.1(c).   (e) Other Inventory
Matters.   (i) Inventory at Excluded Operating PSC. In the event that,
prior to the Sale Hearing, Purchaser elects to exclude an Operating PSC as an
Acquired Asset pursuant to Section 2.5, Sellers shall cooperate
with Purchaser to minimize the amount of Inventory located at, or ordered
with respect to, such Operating PSC, on the Initial Closing Date.   (ii)
Purchase Orders. In the event Purchaser is determined to have the Successful
Bid at the Auction, or in the event there is no Auction, at any time
immediately following the date of the Bid Deadline, Sellers shall, at the
written request of Purchaser, provide copies of any "in process" purchaser
orders for Inventory and/or cancel purchase orders for Inventory ordered with
respect to such Operating PSC, so long as such purchase orders are cancelable
without cost to Seller.     30    (iii) Inventory In Transit. With
respect to Inventory for a particular Operating PSC which is not received at
such Operating PSC on or prior to the Initial Closing Date ("Inventory In
Transit"), Purchaser agrees to accept such Inventory In Transit. Purchaser
shall reimburse Seller for any prepaid amounts in respect of such Inventory
In Transit that is received at any Operating PSC. With respect to any
remaining amounts owed to any vendor relating to any Inventory In Transit,
Purchaser shall negotiate with such vendor for the direct payment by
Purchaser to such vendor of such remaining amounts. To the extent that
Sellers retain any Liability in respect of the Inventory In
Transit, Purchaser shall reimburse Sellers for the net landed cost of such
.Inventory In Transit. The payment obligations of Purchaser described in this
paragraph shall be on an order-by-order basis on or prior to the due date for
payment specified in the vendor\'s invoice.   3.3 Computation of the
Royalty Amount.   (a) Royalty Amount. Sellers shall be entitled to a
"Royalty Amount" for the customers and customer agreements transferred to
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement in an amount equal to one percent (1%)
of the Sales to such customers for the Royalty Period.   (b) Pre-Payment of
Royalty Amount.   (i) At the Initial Closing, subject only to an
upward adjustment pursuant to clause (ii) below, Purchaser shall pay fifty
percent (50%) of the initial estimate of the Royalty Amount due for the first
year of the Royalty Period (the "Initial Estimate Payment"). For purposes of
the Initial Closing, Purchaser and Sellers shall make a good-faith estimate
of the Initial Estimate Payment based upon the annualized run rate of Sales
over the 30-day period immediately preceding and ending on the date which is
three (3) Business Days prior to the Initial Closing Date.   (ii) Seventy-
five days following the Initial Closing Date, Purchaser shall make an
additional payment, if any, by which (x) seventy-five percent (75%) of a
second estimate of the Royalty Amount due for the first year of the Royalty
Period exceeds (y) the Initial Estimate (the "Second Estimate Payment", and
together with the Initial Estimate Payment, the "Royalty Pre-Payment"). For
purposes of the Second Estimate Payment, Purchaser and Sellers shall make a
good-faith estimate of the Second Estimate Payment based upon the annualized
run rate of Sales over the 60-day period immediately following the Initial
Closing Date).   (iii) The remainder of the Royalty Amount due for
the first year of the Royalty Period shall be paid promptly following
final determination of the actual Sales for the first year of the Royalty
Period pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and in no event later than three (3)
Business Days following such determination.   (c) Remainder of the Royalty
Amount. In each of the four (4) subsequent years of the Royalty Period, the
Royalty Amount shall be paid promptly following final determination of the
actual Sales for each quarter in such year and in no event later than three
(3) Business Days following such determination. For purposes of this Section
3.3, "year" shall mean      31   each of the subsequent 12-month
periods following the Initial Closing and shall not refer to calendar or
fiscal years.   (d) Final Determination of Royalty Amount. Within thirty
(30) days after the end of the first year of the Royalty Period or each
quarter following the end of the first year of the Royalty Period, as the
case may be, Purchaser shall calculate actual Sales for the customer
relationships and customer agreements transferred to Purchaser pursuant to
this Agreement and deliver a statement of such Sales to Sellers along with
related work papers (the "Sales Statement"). Purchaser shall make available
to Sellers, at Purchaser\'s applicable office or offices, the books and
records of Purchaser and personnel of Purchaser which Sellers and their
accountants reasonably require and take such other action reasonably
necessary in order to allow Sellers to review and confirm the accuracy of
each Sales Statement. Purchaser shall not charge Sellers for granting access
to such books, records and personnel and shall not charge Sellers for the
provision of copies of any such information. Each Sales Statement, as
prepared by Purchaser, shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
unless Sellers shall deliver written notice of a dispute (a "Dispute Notice")
to Purchaser within ten (10) days following receipt by Sellers of
the applicable Sales Statement. Purchaser and Sellers shall, within five (5)
days following receipt by Purchaser of such Dispute Notice, attempt to
resolve such dispute and agree upon the actual Sales for the applicable
period. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any such dispute
within such five (5) day period, the parties shall, within the subsequent
five (5) day period, mutually select a nationally recognized accounting firm
to make a final determination of the actual Sales for the applicable period,
which determination shall be binding upon the parties. Such mutually selected
accounting firm shall make a final determination with respect to any such
dispute within thirty (30) days following such subsequent five (5) day
period. The costs of such firm shall be borne equally between the
parties.   (e) Royalty Payment for Transferred Customer Agreements.   (i)
To the extent that any customer relationships or customer agreements are sold
or transferred to Third Parties pursuant to Section 2.6 or otherwise,
Purchaser shall pay to Sellers a Royalty Amount for each such customer, with
such Royalty Amount to be determined, at Purchaser\'s discretion, pursuant to
one of the methods specified in clauses (x) and (y) below (with
such determination to be made by Purchaser pursuant to a written notice to
Sellers at least fifteen (15) days prior to the consummation of such sale or
transfer; provided, however, to the extent any customer relationships or
customer agreements are to be sold or transferred to any Third Party
Purchaser at the Initial Closing by the exercise of Purchaser\'s Designation
Rights prior to the Initial Closing, such written notice shall be provided by
Purchaser no later than the first Business Day following the Auction):  
(x) Pre-Payment. On the date following forty-five (45) days after the
consummation of such sale or transfer, Purchaser shall pay to Sellers a
Royalty Amount for each such customer equal to the net present value (using a
discount rate of 10%) of one percent (1%) of the estimate of the Sales to
such customer over the remaining Royalty Period (such estimate to be based
upon Average Actual Sales annualized for the remaining Royalty Period). For
purposes of this section, "Average Actual Sales" shall mean the average
actual Sales for the sixty (60) day period ending thirty (30) days after the
consummation of the sale or transfer of the applicable customer relationships
or agreements for Active Customers; provided,     32   that "Active
Customers" shall mean those customers that continue to order products on a
regular basis (other than Sales during a wind-down period for such customer)
during the two weeks preceding the thirtieth (30th) day after
the consummation of the applicable sales or transfers; provided, further,
that Sales attributable to the thirty (30) day period beginning after the
sale or transfer of the applicable customer relationships or agreements shall
be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the average
actual Sales by Sellers to the applicable customer for the thirty (30) day
period immediately preceding the date of the consummation of such sale or
transfer of the applicable customer account and the denominator shall be the
average actual Sales by both the Third Party transferee and Sellers of
products carried by Sellers with respect to the Business to the applicable
customer for the thirty (30) day period immediately preceding the date of the
consummation of such sale or transfer of the applicable customer account.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, calculations of any
applicable Royalty Amounts may be made pursuant to this Section 3.3(e)(i)(x)
only to the extent that the applicable sale or transfer of customer accounts
occur during the 180 day period immediately following the Initial Closing.
Royalty Amounts for Sales following such 180 day period shall be calculated
pursuant to paragraph 3.3(e)(i)(y) below.   (y) Actual Sales. The applicable
Third Party transferee shall pay to Sellers a Royalty Amount for each such
customer equal to one percent (1%) of the Sales to such customer for the
Royalty Period following the Initial Closing determined in accordance with
the preceding provisions of this Section 3.3, other than paragraph (e)(i)(x);
provided, however, to the extent the Third Party transferee of such customer
accounts is, prior to such sale or transfer, also selling to such customer,
for purposes of calculating any Royalty Amount applicable to such customer,
Sales to such customer shall be the product of (1) actual Sales by Sellers to
such customer for the applicable period and (2) a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the average actual Sales by Sellers to the applicable customer
for the sixty (60) day period immediately preceding the date of the
consummation of such sale or transfer of the applicable customer account and
the denominator shall be the average actual Sales by both the Third Party
transferee and Sellers to the applicable customer for the sixty (60) day
period immediately preceding the date of the consummation of such sale or
transfer of the applicable customer account.   (ii) Prior to the sale or
transfer to any such Third Party, such Third Party Purchaser shall provide
Seller with reasonable adequate assurance of future performance with regards
to servicing and maintaining customer accounts based on any such Third
Party\'s financial wherewithal and operating capabilities.   (iii) To the
extent any such sale or transfer of customer accounts occurs prior to the
time that the Royalty Pre-Payment has been earned in full, any such Royalty
Amount payable pursuant to this Section 3.3(e) shall be decreased by the
portion of the Royalty Pre-Payment attributable to such Customers to the
extent such Royalty Pre-Payment has not been earned in full.     33   
3.4 Prorations Relating to Certain Prepaid Expenses; Other Prepaid Expenses
and Deposits.   (a) Preliminary Proration for the Initial Closing.
Sellers\' Prepaid Expenses relating to Acquired Assets to be assigned,
transferred and delivered to Purchaser at the Initial Closing applicable to
periods both prior to and after the Initial Closing shall be apportioned
between Sellers and Purchaser as of 12:00:01 a.m. on the Initial Closing
Date. Purchaser and Sellers shall, at least five Business Days prior to the
Initial Closing Date, estimate all such prorations and such Sellers\' Prepaid
Expenses. The estimated amount of such proration shall be added to the
Purchase Price if Sellers are entitled to a credit therefor.   (b) Final
Proration for the Initial Closing. Within thirty (30) days after the Initial
Closing Date, Sellers shall calculate all prorations and the Sellers\'
Prepaid Expenses relating to Acquired Assets to be assigned, transferred and
delivered to Purchaser at the Initial Closing and deliver a statement of such
calculations along with related work papers to Purchaser. Sellers shall make
available to Purchaser, without cost or expense to Purchaser, the books and
records of Sellers (and their accountants) and personnel of Sellers which
Purchaser and its accountants reasonably require and take such other action
reasonably necessary in order to allow Purchaser to review and confirm the
accuracy of such statement. Such statement, as prepared by Sellers, shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties unless Purchaser shall deliver a
written notice of a dispute to Sellers within fifteen days following
receipt by Purchaser of such statement. Purchaser and Sellers shall, within
five days following receipt by Sellers of such dispute notice, attempt to
resolve such dispute and agree upon the prorations and the Sellers\' Prepaid
Expenses. Upon final determination of such proration, the applicable party
shall remit to the other party the amount of the difference between such
final determination and estimate of the proration amount. The applicable
party shall remit any such amount no later than thirty (30) days following
such final determination; provided, however, the applicable party shall remit
the applicable portion of any such amounts which are not subject to dispute
within five (5) Business Days following Purchaser\'s delivery of any dispute
notice. In the event that such proration cannot be agreed to by Purchaser and
Sellers within such five day period, a final determination of such proration
shall be referred to a nationally recognized accounting firm designated
jointly by Purchaser and Sellers, whose determination shall be binding upon
the parties.   (c) Subsequent Proration. Sellers Prepaid Expenses relating
to Acquired Assets to be assigned, transferred and delivered to Purchaser at
each Subsequent Closing applicable to periods both prior to and after such
Subsequent Closing shall be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser as of
12:00:01 a.m. on such Subsequent Closing Date.   (i) Preliminary Proration
for Each Subsequent Closing. Sellers\' Prepaid Expenses relating to Acquired
Assets to be assigned, transferred and delivered to Purchaser at each
Subsequent Closing applicable to periods both prior to and after such
Subsequent Closing shall be prorated as of 12:00:01 a.m. on such Subsequent
Closing Date. Purchaser and Sellers shall, at least five Business Days prior
to such Subsequent Closing Date, estimate all such prorations and such
Sellers\' Prepaid Expenses. As appropriate, on the Subsequent Closing Date,
the appropriate party shall remit to the other party all funds, if any, owed
in conjunction with the determination of such preliminary proration provided,
however,     34   that Purchaser shall have the right to set off any
amount owed to it by Sellers hereunder against any amounts owed to Sellers
pursuant to Section 3.3.   (ii) Final Proration for Each Subsequent
Closing. Within thirty (30) days after such Subsequent Closing Date, Sellers
shall calculate and remit all prorations and the Sellers\' Prepaid Expenses
relating to Acquired Assets to be assigned, transferred and delivered to
Purchaser at such Subsequent Closing and deliver a statement of such
calculations along with related work papers to Purchaser. Sellers shall make
available to Purchaser, without cost or expense to Purchaser, the books and
records of Sellers (and their accountants) and personnel of Sellers which
Purchaser and its accountants reasonably require and take such other action
reasonably necessary in order to allow Purchaser to review and confirm the
accuracy of such statement. Such statement, as prepared by Sellers, shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties unless Purchaser shall deliver a
written notice of a dispute to Sellers within fifteen days following receipt
by Purchaser of such statement. Purchaser and Sellers shall, within five days
following receipt by Sellers of such dispute notice, attempt to resolve such
dispute and agree upon the prorations and the Sellers\' Prepaid Expenses.
Upon final determination of such proration, the applicable party shall remit
to the other party the amount of the difference between such final
determination and estimate of the proration amount. The applicable party
shall remit any such amount no later than thirty (30) days following such
final determination; provided, however, the applicable party shall remit the
portion of any such amounts which are not subject to dispute within five (5)
Business days following Purchaser\'s delivery of any dispute notice. In the
event that such proration cannot be agreed to by Purchaser and Sellers within
such five day period, a final determination of such proration shall be
referred to a nationally recognized accounting firm designated jointly by
Purchaser and Sellers, whose determination shall be binding upon the
parties.   3.5 Allocation of Cash Payments. Prior to the expiration of the
Option Period, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller an
allocation of the appropriate portions of the Purchase Price, Assumed
Liabilities and other relevant items among the Acquired Assets, including
goodwill and other assets, in accordance with Code Section 1060 and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and any comparable provisions of
state or local law, as appropriate (the "Allocation"), which Allocation shall
be binding upon the parties and which will be attached to this Agreement as
Schedule 3.5. Purchaser and Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall
report, act and file Tax Returns (including, but not limited to, Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594) in all respects and for all purposes consistent
with such Allocation. Each party shall furnish the other party with such
cooperation and existing information as is reasonably requested by the other
party in connection with the preparation of the Allocation described in this
Section 3.5. Purchaser and Sellers covenant and agree that neither Purchaser
nor Sellers will take any position before any Governmental Entity, in any
judicial proceeding, or in any Tax Return that is in any way inconsistent
with such Allocation unless otherwise required by Law. In the event that the
Allocation is disputed by any taxing authority, the party receiving notice of
such dispute shall promptly notify and consult with the other party and keep
them apprised of material developments concerning resolution of
such dispute.   3.6 Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing
and without further consideration, (i) Sellers, upon the reasonable request
of Purchaser, shall execute and deliver such documents and instruments of
conveyance and transfer as Purchaser may reasonably     35   request
in order to consummate more effectively the purchase and sale of the Acquired
Assets as contemplated hereby and to vest in Purchaser title to the Acquired
Assets transferred hereunder; provided that Sellers shall not be required to
execute or deliver any document or instrument pursuant to this Section 3.6
that includes any provision(s) that imposes obligations upon Sellers that are
different or greater than those imposed upon Sellers under the
other provisions of this Agreement or the documents executed pursuant hereto,
and (ii) Purchaser, upon the request of Sellers, shall execute and deliver
such documents and instruments of contract or lease assumption as Sellers may
reasonably request in order to confirm Purchaser\'s liability for the
obligations assumed hereunder or otherwise more fully consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided that Purchaser shall
not be required to execute or deliver any document or instrument pursuant to
this Section 3.6 that includes any provision(s) that imposes obligations upon
Purchaser that are different or greater than those imposed upon Purchaser
under the other provisions of this Agreement or the documents executed
pursuant hereto.   3.7 Allocation of Certain Sales Proceeds.   (a) The
parties hereto acknowledge that Sellers have entered into and are parties to
purchase agreements (the "Unrelated Purchase Agreements") for sales (the
"Unrelated Sales") by Sellers of distribution centers located in Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma, Salem, Virginia, and York, Pennsylvania and assets related to
such distribution centers (collectively the "Unrelated Assets").   (b)
Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Unrelated Purchase Agreements. If the
Unrelated Sales are not sold pursuant to the Unrelated Purchase Agreements or
such Unrelated Purchase Agreements are otherwise terminated, Sellers shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to promptly sell such Unrelated
Assets to other Third Parties.   (c) If Seller is unable to sell any
Unrelated Assets prior to the expiration of the Option Period, upon Sellers\'
written notice to Purchaser prior to the expiration of the Option Period,
Sellers shall have up to an additional six (6) months (the "Seller Extension
Period") following the end of the Option Period to sell such Unrelated
Assets.   (d) Purchaser shall provide written notice to Seller prior to the
end of the Option Period (or prior to the end of the Seller Extension Period,
if applicable) in accordance with Section 2.6 indicating whether Purchaser
intends to accept and/or reject any Unrelated Asset if such Unrelated Asset
is not sold by Sellers. If no such written notice is provided in accordance
with Section 2.6, then any Unrelated Asset which is not sold by Seller during
the Option Period (or during the Seller Extension Period, if applicable)
shall be an Acquired Asset which shall be transferred to Purchaser and title
shall pass in accordance with this Agreement at the end of the Option Period
(or at the end of the Seller Extension Period) in accordance with
Section 2.5(b)(v).   (e) Purchaser and Sellers agree to treat the payment
of the portion of the Unrelated Proceeds to be received by Purchaser as a
reduction of the Purchase Price for all Tax     36   purposes.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers shall determine, in
their sole discretion, the purchasers for and the terms of sale for such
Unrelated Assets.   (f) Each of Sellers and Purchaser shall be entitled
to one-half of the pre-tax proceeds, net of transaction costs, from the
Unrelated Sales or from any other sale, transfer, lease, assignment or other
transaction involving the Unrelated Assets, whether effected by Sellers or
Purchaser (the "Unrelated Proceeds"). To the extent that any such Unrelated
Sales are consummated on or prior to the Initial Closing, one-half of the
Unrelated Proceeds associated therewith shall reduce the Purchase Price due
at the Initial Closing, and Sellers shall be entitled to retain the remainder
of the Unrelated Proceeds. To the extent that any such Unrelated Sales occur
after the Initial Closing Date, Sellers shall remit one-half of the Unrelated
Proceeds associated therewith to Purchaser immediately upon consummation of
the applicable Unrelated Sales and shall retain the remainder of the
Unrelated Proceeds. To the extent any sale, transfer, lease, assignment or
other transaction involving the Unrelated Assets is effected by Purchaser,
(i) Purchaser shall remit one-half of the Unrelated Proceeds to Sellers
immediately upon consummation of such transaction and shall retain the
remainder of the Unrelated Proceeds and (ii) Purchaser shall determine, in
its sole discretion, the purchasers for and the terms of sale for such
Unrelated Assets.   ARTICLE IV  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

limitation, their respective counsel and accountants), have reasonable access
during normal business hours to all PSCs and all other Owned Real Property

consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) without permitting Sellers
the opportunity to participate therein, and (iii) Purchaser agrees to repair

and smooth transition of the Operating PSCs and the Acquired Assets to a

Removal of Material Equipment.   (a) Sellers agree that other than in the
ordinary course of business, they will not remove, or allow the removal of,
any Material Equipment from any PSC prior to the Applicable Closing Date

of each item of equipment located at each Operating PSC and each operating
facility located at any other Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property
which has a net book value in excess of $2,000 (the "Material Equipment")
shall be made mutually by Purchaser and Sellers. The parties shall together
make a physical accounting of the Material Equipment (the "Initial Equipment
Count", together with the Final Equipment Count (as defined below), the

Equipment Count. To the extent that the parties or such representatives are
unable to resolve any such disputes, within three (3) Business Days following
any such dispute, the parties shall mutually select an independent accounting
firm to make final, binding determinations with respect to any such disputes
within five (5) Business Days following such selection. The cost of such
mutually selected independent accounting firm shall be borne equally by the
parties.   (c) Final Equipment Count. Concurrently with the Inventory Count

respect to any applicable Acquired Asset from the date hereof through the

prohibit Sellers from disclosing Confidential Information to a bona fide
prospective Qualified Bidder in connection with the sale process described in
the Bidding Procedures Order. Each of Purchaser and Sellers shall take all
appropriate steps to safeguard all such Confidential Information with respect
to any applicable Acquired Asset through the Applicable Closing Date and to
protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft. In the
event any Purchaser, Seller or any Affiliate thereof is required to disclose
any such Confidential Information with respect to any applicable Acquired
Asset prior to the Applicable Closing Date pursuant to applicable law,
Purchaser or Sellers, as applicable, shall promptly notify the other party
hereto in writing, which notification shall include the nature of the legal
requirement and the extent of the required disclosure, and shall cooperate
with the other party hereto to preserve the confidentiality of such
information consistent with applicable law.   6.11 Estoppel Certificates.

there shall have been a material breach of this Agreement on the part of the
other party, which material breach is not cured within 10 days following
written notice to the party committing such material breach or which material
breach, by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Initial Closing;   (i)
by either Purchaser or Sellers if Sellers select an Acquisition Proposal as
the Successful Bid;   (j) by either Purchaser or Sellers, if the Initial
Closing shall not have been consummated on or prior to August 29, 2003 (or by
such later date as shall be mutually agreed to by Purchaser and Sellers in
writing, with the consent of the agents under the Pre-Petition Credit
Agreement and the DIP Credit Agreement; provided that the terminating party

further, in the event Purchaser does not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this paragraph until after September 15, 2003, Purchaser shall be entitled to
Expense Reimbursement Payment in accordance with Section 11.2(b) below;  
(k) until 5:00 p.m. (prevailing Eastern time) on July 16, 2003, by Purchaser
on written notice to Sellers if (i) Purchaser, in its absolute and sole
discretion, is not reasonably satisfied with its ability to receive financing
to fund all or a portion of the Purchase Price or (ii) Purchaser, in its
absolute and sole discretion is not reasonably satisfied with the results of
its review and due diligence investigations with respect to the Business and
Acquired Assets;   (l) [INTENTIONALLY DELETED.];     62    (m) by

not have provided written consent to Sellers\' execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
subject to the lenders\' ability to support an Alternative
Transaction pursuant to the Bidding Procedures;   (n) by either Purchaser
or Sellers if the Transition Services Agreement shall not have been executed
by both Purchaser and Fleming on or prior to July 14, 2003; and   (o) by

11.2 Termination Payments.   (a) Break-Up Fee. If the Bidding Procedures
Order has been entered and this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to
Section 11.1(i), (ii) by Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.1(h) or (iii)
pursuant to Section 11.1(o), the Break-Up Fee shall be earned by Purchaser
upon any such termination. If an Alternative Transaction(s) is consummated
within 18 months of the date of this Agreement, then the Break-Up Fee once
earned shall only be payable (x) if such Alternative Transaction is an
Acquisition Proposal (or modification thereof) that was selected as a
Successful Bid or back-up thereto, out of the proceeds of such Alternative
Transaction upon consummation thereof or (y) if otherwise, out of the
proceeds of any such Alternative Transaction to the extent any such proceeds
therefrom (without deduction for Cure Costs) exceed the Estimated Purchase
Price, as and when such proceeds are received. To the extent any Alternative
Transaction is not consummated within 18 months of the date of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall nonetheless retain an administrative claim
for the Break-Up Fee pursuant to Section 11.2(c) below. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and without duplication, any Break-Up Fee that has been earned and
is payable shall be paid, in whole or in part, from any deposit associated
with an Alternative Transaction that any Seller is entitled to
unconditionally retain for its own account.   (b) Expense Reimbursement. If
the Bidding Procedures Order has been entered and this Agreement is
terminated (i) (A) by Sellers pursuant to Section 11.1(j) or (B) by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 11.1(j) which termination complies with the last proviso
thereof, (ii) by Purchaser pursuant to Section 11.1(h), (iii) pursuant to
Section 11.1(i) or (iv) pursuant to Section 11.1(o), Sellers shall upon
termination of this Agreement pay to Purchaser the Expense Reimbursement
Payment (immediately following the submission of the documentation therefor)
.   (c) Priority of Termination Payments. The Break-Up Fee and Expense
Reimbursement Payment and any obligation of Sellers to return the Deposit
hereunder or under the Bidding Procedures Order, shall
constitute administrative expenses of the kind specified in section 503(b)(1)
of the Bankruptcy Code, shall constitute a carveout from Sellers\' Debt Liens
to the extent necessary to make the payments provided for in Sections 11.2(a)
and 11.2(b), and shall not be subject to secured claims of any party,
and, notwithstanding any other order of the Bankruptcy Court, including any
cash collateral or debtor-in-possession financing order entered by the
Bankruptcy Court, no deposit received by the Sellers from any party pursuant
to the Bidding Procedures Order shall be subject to any lien of any creditor
of the Sellers, and shall be     63   first applied to the payment in
full of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense Reimbursement Payment.   11.3
Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 11.1 hereof, this Agreement shall become null and void and of no
further force and effect and the parties shall be relieved of any further
obligations hereunder, except (i) for this Section 11.3, (ii) for
the provisions of Article XI, Sections 14.1, 14.2, 14.4, 14.7, 14.8, 14.9,
14.10, 14.11, 14.12, 14.13, 14.14 and 14.16 hereof, (iii) for the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement relating to the obligation of Purchaser to
keep confidential and not to use certain information and data obtained from
Sellers and to return documents to Sellers and (iv) subject to Sections 11.4
and 14.2, that the termination of this Agreement for any cause shall not
relieve any party hereto from any Liability which at the time of termination
had already accrued to any other party hereto or which thereafter may accrue
in respect of any act or omission of such party prior to such termination;
provided, however, Purchaser shall have no liability to Sellers and Sellers
hereby waive any and all rights or claims against Parent, Purchaser or their
Affiliates in the event Purchaser terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11.1(k) above.   11.4 Deposit. Upon termination of this Agreement
(other than by Sellers pursuant to Section 11.1(h)), the Escrow Agent shall
be authorized to promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days of
such termination) return the Deposit (together with all interest earned
thereon) to Purchaser; provided, further, that in the event of termination by
Purchaser under Section 11.1(k) Sellers shall have no right to contest or
object to the return of the Deposit (together with all interest earned
thereon) to Purchaser and Sellers waive any and all rights or claims that
Sellers may have against the Purchaser or its Affiliates with respect to such
termination; provided, further, that the Escrow Agent shall have no right to,
and under no circumstances shall the Escrow Agent refuse to return the
Deposit (together with all interest earned thereon) to Purchaser in the event
that Purchaser is terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1(k).  
11.5 Other Proposals. In the event this Agreement is terminated by Purchaser
pursuant to Section 11.1 or otherwise, to the extent Purchaser has entered
into any agreements preventing other Third Parties to such agreements from
reviewing, discussing, negotiating or submitting proposals for or
otherwise preventing any transaction by such Third Parties for the
acquisition of any portion of the Acquired Assets, Purchaser shall
immediately terminate any and all such agreements or otherwise release such
Third Parties from such prohibitions.   ARTICLE XII  ADDITIONAL
COVENANTS   12.1 Employees.   (a) Business Employees.   (i) Until the
applicable Determination Date, Sellers shall provide the services of the
Business Employees and shall continue to provide wages, benefits and other
terms and conditions of employment consistent with past practices, all
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. As of the applicable
Determination Date, the applicable Business     64   Employees shall be
terminated by Sellers and offered employment by Purchaser on terms and
conditions to be determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion, consistent
with the provisions of this Article XII. Following the Initial Closing,
Purchaser shall provide written notice to Sellers at least thirty (30) days
prior to determining the Determination Date for the applicable
Business Employees, so that Sellers may terminate such Business Employees as
of the date immediately preceding such Determination Date. Purchaser shall
have no liability for and no obligation to assume or to adopt any of
Sellers\' collective bargaining agreements or other agreements with any labor
unions or labor organizations, and, until validly terminated without any
Liability, Sellers shall retain all such agreements and all obligations and
liabilities arising therefrom, whenever arising or accruing.   (ii) All
Liabilities to the current Employees of the Business (the "Business
Employees") arising or accruing on or prior to the Determination Date,
including wages, earned vacations, workers\' compensation, employee benefits,
Liabilities under any collective bargaining agreement, WARN Act Liabilities,
workers compensation Liabilities, COBRA Liabilities, severance and bonus
payments, withholding and reporting obligations, all laws relating to the
employment of labor and the employer\'s share of payroll or other
employment taxes and other obligations (collectively, the "Employee
Obligations"), shall be the obligation of Sellers ("Sellers\' Employee
Obligations"), and all such Employee Obligations arising or accruing on and
after the New Hire Date and thereafter to those Business Employees who are
hired by Purchaser (the "New Employees"), and which relate to such Business
Employees\' employment with Purchaser, and liability for any unlawful
discriminatory conduct on the part of the Purchaser in the hiring or non-
hiring of Business Employees before or after the Determination Date, shall be
the obligation of Purchaser ("Purchaser\'s Employee Obligations"). Except for
the Purchaser\'s Employee Obligations, all obligations and liabilities,
including, without limitation, pension and benefit plan liabilities
(including multiemployer plan withdrawal liabilities), liabilities under or
relating to any collective bargaining agreement, discrimination liabilities,
severance and bonus pay obligations, worker\'s compensation, WARN Act
liabilities, accrued vacation time and COBRA liabilities, relating to current
or former employees (and their dependents) of the Sellers or the Business
shall, whenever arising or accruing, remain the sole obligation of Sellers
("Sellers\' Employment Obligations"). On or after the date
hereof, Purchaser\'s representatives shall be permitted to meet and speak
with the Business Employees for purposes of discussing potential job
opportunities with Purchaser; provided, however, Purchaser shall not meet and
speak with such Business Employees or otherwise contact such Business
Employees other than through a designee of Sellers, and only after
coordinating and consulting with such designee. Sellers hereby specifically
agree not to transfer any of the Business Employees (including, without
limitation, the Business Employees who manage the operations of the PSCs) to
any other locations of Sellers not comprising the PSCs until the expiration
of the Option Period. Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers within ten (10)
Business Days after the Determination Date a complete list of all Business
Employees to whom Purchaser has offered employment as of such applicable
Determination Date.   (b) [INTENTIONALLY DELETED.]   (c) No Third Party
Beneficiaries. The obligations of Sellers and Purchaser hereunder to the New
Employees are for the sole benefit of either Sellers or Purchaser, and no
inference should be drawn that any New Employee is a beneficiary of any of
the terms,     65   provisions and obligations hereunder. The ability
to enforce the obligations of Sellers and/or Purchaser hereunder with respect
to such New Employees shall be the right of either Sellers or Purchaser, as
applicable, but not any New Employee.   (d) Agreement to Cooperate. Subject
to any restrictions that would limit Sellers\' participation or disclosure of
material, Sellers agree to cooperate with Purchaser prior to the Initial
Closing Date to the extent reasonably necessary for Purchaser to evaluate
Sellers\' Benefit Plans in connection with Purchaser\'s evaluation of which
Business Employees it wishes to offer employment to.   12.2 Benefit
Plans.   (a) Sellers\' 401(k) Plan. Sellers sponsor a defined contribution
plan which provides, in part, deferrals of compensation under Section 401(k)
of the Code entitled "Fleming Companies, Inc. Matching 401(k) Plan" (the
"Sellers 401(k) Plan"). All Business Employees will be deemed 100% vested and
nonforfeitable in their respective benefits in Sellers 401(k) Plan as of the
Determination Date. Effective as of the Determination Date, Sellers
shall cause all accruals of benefits in respect of the Business Employees
under Sellers 401(k) Plan to cease.   (b) Sellers\' Pension Plans. Sellers
sponsor pension plans for the Business Employees ("Sellers\' Pension Plans").
To the extent permitted by Law, all Business Employees will be deemed 100%
vested and nonforfeitable (to the extent funded) in their respective benefits
in Sellers\' Pension Plans as of the date of termination of employment of
such Business Employee. Effective as of the date of termination of employment
of such Business Employee, all New Employees shall be deemed, for all
purposes in applying Sellers\' Pension Plans, to have terminated their
service with Sellers on that date. Benefits earned under Sellers\' Pension
Plans as of the date of termination of employment of such Business Employee
shall be paid and distributed in accordance with the terms of Sellers\'
Pension Plans. No further benefits shall accrue under Sellers\' Pension Plans
with respect to the New Employees after the Determination Date, and Purchaser
shall have no obligation under, or relating to Sellers\' Pension
Plans (including with respect to any withdrawal liability under such plan) or
any obligation to New Employees to provide a pension plan.   (c) Benefit
Plans. The Business Employees shall cease active participation in the
Sellers\' Benefit Plans as of the applicable Determination Date on which such
Business Employee becomes a New Employee. Sellers shall provide adequate
prior notice of such termination of participation in Sellers\' Benefit Plans
to Business Employees to permit such Business Employees to submit any claims
prior to the applicable Determination Date.   12.3 Intellectual
Property.   (a) Except as set forth in Section 12.3(c) below or in
the Transition Services Agreement, as of the Applicable Closing Date with
respect to the applicable Company Owned Intellectual Property, Sellers will
not use, register or authorize others to use or register Company Owned
Intellectual Property or any other intellectual property substantially or
confusingly similar thereto and will not challenge Purchaser\'s right to use
or register the Company Owned Intellectual Property.     66    (b) It
is expressly agreed that Purchaser is purchasing, acquiring or otherwise
obtaining all of Sellers\' and their Affiliates\' right, title or interest in
and to the name "Fleming," or any Trademarks related thereto owned by Sellers
(collectively, "Fleming Trademarks and Logos").   (c) For the period from
the Initial Closing Date until the closing of the Chapter 11 Case (the
"Bankruptcy Period"), Purchaser hereby grants to Sellers and their Affiliates
("Licensees"), effective upon the Initial Closing Date, a non-transferable,
non-exclusive, royalty free worldwide transitional right and license to use
the Fleming Trademarks and Logos as they exist as of the Initial Closing and
are contained on any websites, business cards, schedules, stationery,
displays, signs, promotional materials, manuals, forms, computer software and
other material used in Sellers\' business or are otherwise currently being
used in the conduct of the Business (the "Marks"), without any obligation on
the part of Sellers to pay royalties or similar fees to Purchaser during the
Bankruptcy Period. This transitional license shall permit use of the Marks
solely for the purposes set forth in this Section 12.3. The transitional
license shall permit Sellers to use the Marks solely as follows (the
"Transitional License"): for administrative, corporate and legal use
during the Bankruptcy Period except to the extent reasonably necessary for
compliance with the notice or other requirements of the Bankruptcy Code or
compliance with other applicable Law. No other use of the Marks shall be made
by Licensees during the Bankruptcy Period without Purchaser\'s express
written consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Any
and all rights and goodwill arising from the use of the Marks by Licensees
pursuant to this Transitional License shall inure solely to Purchaser\'s
benefit. Licensees agree that neither Sellers, nor any of their Affiliates,
shall use, directly or indirectly, the Marks in any other way that suggests
that there is a relation or affiliation between Licensees and Purchaser or
any of Purchaser\'s Affiliates other than that as created by this Agreement,
or as a trademark, service mark or trade name for Licensees. Nothing in this
Agreement or in the performance thereof, or that might otherwise be implied
by law, shall operate to grant Licensees any right, title or interest in and
to the Marks. Licensees shall assign to Purchaser, and do hereby assign to
Purchaser, any rights they may acquire, if any, by the operation of law or
otherwise, in the Marks pursuant to this Transitional License. As between the
parties, Purchaser shall have the sole right, and in its sole discretion, may
commence, prosecute, defend and control any action concerning the Marks.
Sellers agree that: (i) immediately upon termination of the Bankruptcy
Period, Sellers shall cease and desist, and cause all Affiliates and
licensees of Sellers and their Affiliates to cease and desist, from all
further use of the Fleming Trademarks and Logos and will adopt new Trademarks
related thereto which are not confusingly similar to the Fleming Trademarks
and Logos; (ii) immediately upon termination of the Bankruptcy Period,
Sellers shall make appropriate filings with any and all
applicable registry(ies) changing their corporate names and any d/b/a to a
name that does not include any of the Fleming Trademarks and Logos or words
confusingly similar thereto; and (iii) except as set forth in this Section,
neither Sellers nor any of Sellers\' Affiliates shall make any use of the
Fleming Trademarks and Logos. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, to the extent there are any inconsistencies between the provisions
of this Section 12.3 and the Transition Services Agreement, the Transition
Services Agreement shall control.     67    12.4 Infringement.   (a)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers shall
have no obligation to defend, indemnify or hold harmless Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates from damages, costs or expenses resulting from any obligation,
suit or proceeding based upon any claim that any activity subsequent to the
Closing Date engaged in by Purchaser, a customer of Purchaser\'s or anyone
claiming under Purchaser constitutes direct or contributory infringement,
misuse or misappropriation of or inducement to infringe any Third Party
Intellectual Property.   (b) Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers and any of its Affiliates from and against any and all
Indemnifiable Losses resulting from any obligation, proceeding or suit based
upon any claim alleging or asserting direct or contributory infringement,
misuse or misappropriation of or inducement to infringe by, Sellers or any of
their Affiliates of any Third Party Intellectual Property to the extent that
such claim is based on, or would not have arisen but for, activity conducted
or engaged in subsequent to the Initial Closing Date by Purchaser, a customer
of Purchaser\'s or anyone claiming under Purchaser.   12.5 Filing of Tax
Returns. In connection with the preparation and filing of Tax Returns as of
and after the Initial Closing Date, Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate and
exchange information as reasonably required to accomplish the matters
contemplated by this Article XII.   12.6 Access to Books and Records for
Taxes. After the Initial Closing, upon reasonable notice, and subject to
Section 6.10, each party will give to the representatives, employees, counsel
and accountants of the other party, access, during normal business hours, to
records pertaining to the Business, the PSCs or the Acquired Assets and
relating to periods prior to or including the Initial Closing Date, and will
permit such persons to examine and copy such records, in each case to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party in connection with Tax and
financial reporting matters, audits, legal proceedings, governmental
investigations and other business purposes (including such financial
information and any receipts evidencing payment of Taxes as may be requested
by Sellers to substantiate any claim for Tax credits or refunds); provided,
however, that nothing herein will obligate any party to take actions that
would unreasonably disrupt the normal course of its business or violate
the terms of any Contract to which it is a party or to which any of its
assets is subject. Sellers and Purchaser will cooperate with each other in
the conduct of any Tax audit or similar proceedings involving or otherwise
relating to the Business, the Acquired Assets or the PSCs (or the income
therefrom or assets thereof) with respect to any Tax and each will execute
and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to
carry out the intent of this Section 12.6.   12.7 Transaction Taxes.
Purchaser and Sellers covenant and agree that they will use their best
efforts to obtain an order from the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to Section
1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code exempting, to the maximum extent possible, the
transfer of the Acquired Assets from Sellers to Purchaser, or from Sellers to
any Third Party Purchaser, from any and all Transaction Taxes as hereinafter
defined. To the extent the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
not exempt under Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, each party hereto
shall bear and be responsible for paying fifty percent (50%) of any sales,
use, stamp, transfer, documentary, registration, business and occupation and
other similar taxes (including related     68   penalties (civil or
criminal), additions to tax and interest) imposed by any Governmental Entity
with respect to the transfer of the operations of the Business, the PSCs and
any Acquired Assets to Purchaser or any Third Party Purchaser ("Transaction
Taxes"), regardless of whether the Tax authority seeks to collect such taxes
from Sellers or Purchaser. Sellers shall have the responsibility for
preparing and delivering to the Purchaser or, as relevant, Third Party
Purchaser a draft of any Transaction Tax Return ("Draft Transaction Tax
Return") at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Applicable
Closing Date, or if later, the required filing date for the relevant
Transaction Tax Return as prescribed by applicable Law. Purchaser, or as
relevant, Third Party Purchaser, shall have the opportunity to review any
such Draft Transaction Tax Return and shall have five (5) Business Days
therefrom to provide reasonable comments to the Sellers with respect to such
Draft Transaction Tax Return. The Sellers, acting in good faith, shall give
due and adequate consideration to any such comments and shall reflect such
comments in the final Transaction Tax Return to be filed to the extent that
the Sellers, acting in good faith, determine is necessary in order to
properly comply with the requirements of applicable Law. At the Applicable
Closing Date, or, if later, the required filing date as prescribed by
applicable Law for the filing of the relevant Transaction Tax Return, (x)
Purchaser or, as relevant, Third Party Purchaser shall provide the Sellers
with a certified check or checks, made out to the applicable Governmental
Entity, for the Purchaser\'s share of the Transaction Taxes shown as due on
the applicable final Transaction Tax Return and (y) Sellers shall provide
Purchaser or as relevant, Third Party Purchaser, a copy of the applicable
duly and properly completed and executed final Transaction Tax Return,
together with proof of payment of any Transaction Taxes shown as due on such
final Transaction Tax Return. Sellers shall be responsible for defending
or pursuing any proceedings related to such Transaction Taxes, and each
party hereto shall pay fifty percent (50%) of any expenses related thereto.
Purchaser shall give prompt written notice to the other party hereto of any
proposed adjustment or assessment of any Transaction Taxes with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby and in the Ancillary Documents. In
any proceedings, whether formal or informal, Sellers shall permit Purchaser
to participate in the defense of such proceeding with respect to such
Transaction Taxes, and shall take all actions and execute all documents
required to allow such participation and Sellers shall not settle any such
proceedings without Purchaser\'s consent which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   12.8 Tax Prorations for Periodic Taxes. As to any
Acquired Asset acquired by Purchaser, Sellers and Purchaser shall apportion
the liability for real and personal property taxes, ad valorem taxes, and
similar taxes ("Periodic Taxes") for all Tax periods including but not
beginning or ending on the Applicable Closing Date applicable to such
Acquired Asset (all such periods of time being hereinafter called "Proration
Periods"). The Periodic Taxes described in this Section 12.8 shall be
apportioned between Sellers and Purchaser as of the Applicable Closing Date,
with Purchaser liable for that portion of the Periodic Taxes equal to the
Periodic Tax for the Proration Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days remaining in the applicable Proration Period
after the Applicable Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total
number of days covered by such Proration Period. Sellers shall be liable for
that portion of the Periodic Taxes for a Proration Period for which Purchaser
is not liable under the preceding sentence. Purchaser and Sellers shall pay
or be reimbursed for real and personal property taxes (including instances in
which such property taxes have been paid before the Applicable Closing Date)
on this prorated basis. If a payment on a tax bill is due after the
Applicable Closing, the party that is legally required to make such payment
shall make such payment and promptly forward an invoice to the other party
for its pro rata share, if any. If the     69   other party does not
pay the invoice within 30 calendar days of receipt, the amount of such
payment shall bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum. The party
responsible under applicable Law for paying a Tax described in this Section
12.8 shall be responsible for administering the payment of (and
any reimbursement for) such Tax. For purposes of this Section 12.8, the
Proration Period for ad valorem taxes and real and personal property taxes
shall be the fiscal period for which such taxes were assessed by the Tax
jurisdiction.   12.9 Tax Refunds. Any Tax refunds (including any interest
related thereto) received by Purchaser, its Affiliates or successors relating
to Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the Applicable
Closing Date (with respect to the relevant Acquired Asset) shall be for the
account of Sellers, and Purchaser shall pay over to Sellers any such amount
(net of any Taxes payable by Purchaser or its owners as a result of receiving
such Tax refunds, plus the net present value using the Purchaser\'s
applicable cost of borrowing as of the date of the determination of any Tax
benefit, all as reasonably determined by Purchaser, by reason of deduction,
credit or otherwise, realized by the Purchaser as a result of the payment or
obligation to pay Sellers under Section 12.9) within five (5) Business Days
of receipt thereof. Purchaser shall include with its remittance to Sellers
copies of any correspondence, documents, or other materials received or
transmitted by Purchaser with respect to the Tax refund and, if the amount of
the remittance is less than the amount of the refund, an explanation as to
how Purchaser determined the amount of the remittance to Sellers. Sellers
shall be entitled to request that Purchaser, at Sellers\' expense, file for
and obtain any Tax refunds with respect to Tax periods or portions thereof
ending on or before the Applicable Closing Date (with respect to the relevant
Acquired Asset). Purchaser\'s consent to such request shall not be
unreasonably withheld.   12.10 Tax Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, or in the Confidentiality Agreement, each party to
the transactions contemplated herein (and each Affiliate and Person acting on
behalf of any such party) agrees that each party (and each employee,
representative and other agent of such party) may disclose to any and all
Persons, without limitation of any kind, the Tax treatment and Tax structure
of the transaction and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
Tax analyses) that are provided to such party or such Person relating to such
Tax treatment and Tax structure, except to the extent necessary to comply
with any applicable federal or state securities laws; provided, however, that
such disclosure may not be made until the earlier of the date of any public
announcement of discussions relating to the transactions, the date of any
public announcement of the transactions, or the date of the execution of this
Agreement. This authorization shall not permit disclosure of any other
information including (without limitation) (a) any portion of any materials
to the extent not related to the Tax treatment or Tax structure of
the transactions, (b) the identities of participants or potential
participants in the transactions, (c) the existence or status of any
negotiations, (d) any pricing or financial information (except to the extent
such pricing or financial information is related to the Tax treatment or Tax
structure of the transactions), or (e) any other term or detail not relevant
to the Tax treatment or the Tax structure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.   12.11 Ownership of Acquired Assets for Tax Purposes.
Purchaser and Sellers shall treat the applicable Seller as the owner of each
Acquired Asset for all Tax purposes until the Applicable Closing Date with
respect to such Acquired Asset.     70    12.12 Hart-Scott-Rodino.
With respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each party
hereto shall file or cause to be filed, promptly but in no event later than
the Business Day immediately following the entry of the Bidding Procedures
Order, (a) any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act with the
United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the Department of Justice
("DOJ"), and request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act; and (b) any pre-acquisition filings required by any foreign countries.
Purchaser shall be responsible for and pay all filing fees associated with
such notifications and filings.   12.13 Compliance with Antitrust Laws and
Government Requests. Subject to the terms and conditions herein, the parties
agree to use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary to expeditiously consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to respond
promptly to government requests for information, and obtain all necessary
governmental, judicial or regulatory actions or non-actions, orders, waivers,
consents, clearances, extensions and approvals. In addition to and without
limiting the agreements of the parties contained above, Sellers and Purchaser
shall (a) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request for
additional information or documentary material received by Sellers or
Purchaser or any of their Affiliates from the FTC or the DOJ pursuant to the
HSR Act or from any other Governmental Entity in connection with antitrust
matters, (b) cooperate with each other in connection with any filing under
the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any investigation or other
inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated hereby commenced by the FTC,
DOJ or any other Governmental Entity, and (c) use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby under any antitrust law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other covenant herein contained, nothing
in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Purchaser or Sellers (i) to
commence any litigation against any Person in order to facilitate the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to take
or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the business,
assets, condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations or
prospects of Purchaser on the one hand, or the Business, on the other hand,
(iii) to defend against any litigation brought by any Governmental Entity
seeking to prevent the consummation of, or impose limitations on, any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (iv) to divest or hold separate or in
trust (or the imposition of any other material condition or restriction with
respect to) any assets or operations of Purchaser and its Affiliates or the
Business or the Acquired Assets.   12.14 Certain Ancillary Documents.
Without limiting the generality of Sections 6.6 and 7.4, each party shall use
its best efforts to mutually agree upon the form of the Transition Services
Agreement, Cure Escrow Agreement, Deposit Escrow Agreement and Indemnity
Escrow Agreement on or before July 14, 2003 and to finalize Schedules 3.2,
3.2(d) and 8.11 on or prior to such date.   ARTICLE XIII

and Agreements. Except as set forth below, each of the representations and

the Initial Closing Date for the periods indicated below: (a) Section 4.5(a)

13.2 Indemnification.   (a) Following the Initial Closing and subject to the
other sections of this Article XIII, Sellers will jointly and severally
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates and their
respective directors, officers, employees, advisors, representatives and
agents from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, costs and/or
expenses (including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys\' fees and expenses)
actually incurred by Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective
directors, officers, employees, advisors, representatives and agents,
including in connection with any actions, suits, demands, assessments,
judgments and settlements, in any such case reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds recovered from any Person or entity with respect thereto
("Indemnifiable Losses") relating to, resulting from or arising out of:  
(i) any inaccuracy in any of the representations and warranties made by any
Seller in this Agreement;   (ii) a breach by any Seller of any covenant
or agreement of any Seller contained in this Agreement or any of Sellers\'
Ancillary Documents;   (iii) any Transaction Taxes the payment of which
is the responsibility of Sellers pursuant to Section 12.7;   (iv) any Cure
Costs; and   (v) any of the Excluded Liabilities.   (b) Following the
Initial Closing and subject to the other sections of this Article XIII,
Purchaser will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, advisors,
representatives and agents from and against all Indemnifiable Losses relating
to, resulting from or arising out of:    72    (i) any inaccuracy in any
of the representations or warranties made by Purchaser in this Agreement;  
(ii) a breach by Purchaser of any covenant or agreement of such entity
contained in this Agreement or any Purchaser Ancillary Document;   (iii)
any Transaction Taxes the payment of which is the responsibility of Purchaser
pursuant to Section 12.7; and   (iv) any of the Assumed Liabilities.   (c)
Payments made under this Section 13.2 shall be treated by Purchaser and
Sellers as purchase price adjustments, and Purchaser and Sellers shall file
all Tax Returns consistent with such treatment.   13.3 Limitations on
Liability.   (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
or of any applicable Law, no Person entitled to indemnity hereunder (each,
an "Indemnitee") will be entitled to make a claim against a party required
to provide indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnifying Party")
for Indemnifiable Losses arising out of or relating to any inaccuracy
of representations or warranties under Sections 13.2(a)(i) or 13.2(b)(i)
until the aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Losses exceeds an amount equal to
$500,000 (the "Indemnification Threshold"). In the event and to the extent
the aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Losses against an Indemnifying Party
exceeds the Indemnification Threshold, such party shall be responsible for
all Indemnifiable Losses from the first dollar of such Losses, but subject to
the Indemnification Cap.   (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the indemnification obligations of Sellers under Section
13.2(a)(i) or the indemnification obligation of Purchaser under Section
13.2(b)(i) will not exceed an amount equal to $15,000,000 (the
"Indemnification Cap"), respectively.   (c) The obligation of Sellers to
indemnify under Section 13.2(a)(i) and the obligation of Purchaser to
indemnify under Section 13.2(b)(i) shall expire, with respect to any
representation or warranty of the respective party, on the date on which the
survival of such representation or warranty shall expire in accordance with
Section 13.1; provided that such representation or warranty shall survive the
time it would otherwise terminate with respect to a specific claim if notice
of the inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to the right of
indemnification shall have been given to the Indemnifying Party prior to the
time such representation or warranty would otherwise terminate.   (d) No
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or obligated to indemnify any
Indemnitee hereunder for any consequential, punitive or exemplary damages;
provided, however, to the extent that an Indemnitee is
seeking indemnification hereunder for any Third Party Claim (other than any
Third Party Claim brought by any Third Party Purchaser), the Indemnifying
Party shall only be liable for consequential, punitive or exemplary damages
to the extent that the     73   Third Party asserting such Third Party
Claim seeks and recovers consequential, punitive or exemplary damages from
the Indemnitee.   (e) The parties shall cooperate with each other with
respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which one party
is obligated to indemnify the other party hereunder, including by making
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or
liability.   (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Purchaser\'s right to indemnification with respect to Indemnifiable
Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out of matters described in
clause (i) of Section 13.2(a) shall be satisfied exclusively from the
Indemnity Escrow Amount and Purchaser shall have no right of set-off against
any amounts due to Sellers under this Agreement or any Ancillary Documents as
a result of any such Indemnifiable Losses. Purchaser acknowledges that its
sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the matters described in clause (i)
of Section 13.2(a) shall be pursuant to this Article XIII. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser may exercise a right of set-off as
a result of any Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or arising
out of matters described in clauses (ii) through (v) of Section 13.2(a);
provided, however, Purchaser shall only be permitted to exercise such right
of set-off only to the extent Purchaser first seeks recourse against the
Indemnity Escrow Amount and has exhausted such Indemnity Escrow Amount in
full.   (g) Sellers shall have no obligation under Section 13.2(a)
to indemnify any Indemnitee for Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting
from or arising out of Excluded Liabilities to the extent (and only to the
extent) the Indemnitee takes any identifiable action which directly causes
the Excluded Liabilities to be a Liability of Purchaser. Moreover, Seller
shall have no obligation under Section 13.2(a) for up to $500,000 in
aggregate reasonable costs and expenses of the Indemnitee of defending a
Third Party Claim or of otherwise resolving a Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifiable Losses associated therewith, relating to, resulting from or
arising out of Excluded Liabilities.   13.4 Defense of Claims.   (a) If
any Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any claim or of the
commencement of any action or proceeding by any Person or Governmental Entity
that is not a party to this Agreement (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnitee, with respect to which an Indemnifying Party is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee will give such
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any event
not later than 20 calendar days after receipt of notice of such Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that the failure of the Indemnitee to notify
the Indemnifying Party shall only relieve the Indemnifying Party from its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee pursuant to this Article XIII to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure
(whether as a result of the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses or
otherwise). Upon receipt of notification of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, upon written notice to the Indemnitee,
to assume the investigation and defense thereof if such Indemnifying Party
delivers a written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Indemnitee agreeing to indemnify the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim; provided that notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Indemnifying Party     74   shall have no right to assume
or continue the defense of any Third Party Claim (and the Indemnitee shall
have the exclusive right to defend it) if (i) the Indemnitee reasonably
determines that the Indemnifying Party does not have sufficient financial
resources to defend or discharge such Third Party Claim, (ii) if a conflict
of interest is presented for the Indemnifying Party from defense of the Third
Party Claim, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party is not vigorously defending such
Third Party Claim, as reasonably determined by the Indemnitee. Whether or not
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the investigation and defense of any
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ one separate
counsel (plus one separate local counsel) and to participate in the
investigation and defense thereof; provided, however, that the Indemnitee
shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of such separate counsel.
Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party
will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim that would lead
to liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnitee unless such settlement includes as an unconditional term
thereof the release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect of such
Third Party Claim. If a settlement offer solely for money damages is made by
the applicable third party claimant, and the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnifying Party\'s willingness to accept the
settlement offer and pay the amount called for by such offer without
reservation of any rights or defenses against the Indemnitee, the Indemnitee
may continue to contest such claim, free of any participation by the
Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to
such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party has an obligation to pay
hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (A) the amount of the settlement
offer that the Indemnitee declined to accept or (B) the aggregate
Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitee with respect to such claim.   (b)
Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss that does not
result from a Third Party Claim will be asserted by giving the Indemnifying
Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party
will have a period of 30 calendar days within which to respond in writing to
such claim.   (c) If, after the making of any Indemnification Payment,
the amount of the Indemnifiable Loss to which such payment relates is reduced
by recovery, settlement or otherwise under any insurance coverage, or
pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any
other entity, the amount of such reduction (less any costs, expenses,
premiums or Taxes incurred in connection therewith) will promptly be repaid
by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. Upon making any Indemnification
Payment, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such Indemnification
Payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee against any third
party that is not an Affiliate of the Indemnitee in respect of the
Indemnifiable Loss to which the Indemnification Payment relates; provided
that (i) the Indemnifying Party shall then be in compliance with its
obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss, and
(ii) until the Indemnitee recovers full payment of its Indemnifiable Loss,
all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such third party on account
of said Indemnification Payment will be subrogated and subordinated in right
of payment to the Indemnitee\'s rights against such third party. Without
limiting the generality or effect of any other provision of this Article XIII
each such Indemnitee and Indemnifying Party will duly execute upon request
all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-
described subrogation and subordination rights.     75    13.5
Indemnity Escrow.   (a) The parties acknowledge and agree that the
Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be funded solely from the Royalty Amount as
follows:   (i) No amount of the Indemnity Escrow Amount shall be satisfied
from the Initial Estimate Payment.   (ii) 25% of the Second Estimate Payment
otherwise due and payable to Sellers shall be remitted by Purchaser into the
Indemnity Escrow and thereafter, 25% of any Royalty Amount otherwise due and
payable to Sellers shall be remitted by Purchaser into the Indemnity
Escrow.   (iii) 25% of any Royalty Amount in respect of any customer
accounts sold or transferred to Third Parties otherwise due and payable to
Sellers pursuant to Section 3.3(e) shall be remitted by Purchaser into
the Indemnity Escrow.   (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in no event shall any Royalty Amounts be deposited into the
Indemnity Escrow in an amount exceeding $15,000,000 in the aggregate (i.e.,
aggregating all Royalty Amounts deposited in the Indemnity Escrow, regardless
of whether successful claims have been made against the Indemnity Escrow,
thereby reducing the Indemnity Escrow below $15,000,000).   13.6
Indemnification Procedures.   (a) An Indemnitee shall only be permitted to
assert indemnification claims or set-off rights under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement by written notice (the "Claim Notice") to Indemnifying
Party specifying (i) the matters set forth in Section 13.2(a) or Section
13.2(b), as the case may be, pursuant to which an Indemnitee is asserting
its indemnification or set-off rights; (ii) a general description of the
underlying facts relating thereto, and (iii) a reasonable estimate of the
amount of the Indemnifiable Losses (if such Indemnifiable Losses can be
reasonably estimated) or set-off rights, as applicable.   (b) Indemnitee
shall make available to Indemnifying Party, with the cost and expense thereof
to Indemnifying Party, the books and records of Indemnitee and personnel of
Indemnitee which Indemnifying Party and its representatives reasonably
require and take such other action reasonably necessary in order to allow
Indemnifying Party to review and confirm the accuracy of the Claim Notice.
Such notice, including Indemnitee\'s determination of Indemnifiable Losses or
set-off shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties unless Indemnifying
Party shall deliver a written notice (the "Claim Dispute Notice") of a
dispute to Indemnitee within 30 days following receipt by Indemnifying Party
of a Claim Notice. Indemnitee and Indemnifying Party shall, within 30 days
following receipt by Indemnitee of such Claim Dispute Notice, attempt to
resolve any such dispute, including Indemnitee\'s determination of the amount
of the Indemnifiable Losses or set-off. In the event the parties are unable
to resolve any such dispute within such 30-day period, the validity of the
claim and the amount of Indemnifiable Losses, if any, or set-off, if
any, shall be determined in accordance with Section 14.8.     76   
ARTICLE XIV  MISCELLANEOUS   14.1 Fees and Expenses, Transfer Taxes.  
(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided for elsewhere in this Agreement,
each party hereto shall bear its own costs and expenses, with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the parties shall bear its
own attorneys\' fees; provided, further, that the parties acknowledge and
agree that (i) Purchaser\'s counsel shall prepare initial drafts of
substantially all applicable filings, motions and other papers related to
transactions with Third Party Purchasers which are required by the Bankruptcy
Code and the Bankruptcy Court and (ii) Sellers\' counsel shall prepare all
such related notices to Third Parties.   (b) To the extent provided in the
Sale Order, in accordance with Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, each
instrument transferring any Acquired Assets to Purchaser shall contain the
following endorsement:   Because this instrument has been authorized
pursuant to Order  of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District
of  Delaware relating to a chapter 11 plan of the Grantor, it is  exempt
from transfer taxes, stamp taxes or similar taxes  pursuant to 11 U.S.C.
Section 1146(c)."  In addition, Sellers shall seek an order that provides
that any transaction, consummated within six months from the Closing Date,
whereby Purchaser transfers or assigns any of the Acquired Assets to a Third
Party, shall be exempt from all Taxes within the scope of 11 U.S.C. Section
1146(c).   14.2 Liquidated Damages. In the event the Initial Closing is
not consummated as a result of a breach by Purchaser, Sellers\' exclusive
remedy shall be limited to the amount of the Deposit at any point in time and
such amount shall serve as liquidated damages, and the parties hereto agree
that such liquidated damages are reasonable in proportion to the probable
damages likely to be sustained in the event of any such breach in view of the
uncertainty and difficulty of predicting the amount of any actual
damages.   14.3 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, modified
or supplemented in any respect except by a written instrument signed by all
of the parties to this Agreement, expressly stating that such instrument
intended to amend, modify or supplement this Agreement.   14.4 Notices. Any
notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder by a
party hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given, (a)

telex, telecopy or other wire transmission (with answer back confirmation of
such transmission), (c) upon delivery, if delivered by a nationally known
commercial courier service providing next day delivery service (such as

other wire transmission or (b) on the first Business Day after sending, if
sent by overnight delivery, properly addressed and prepaid or (c) upon

connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in this
Section 14.4, or in such other manner as may be permitted by law, shall be
valid and sufficient service thereof.   14.5 Waivers. The failure of a party
hereto at any time or times to require performance of any provision hereof
shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to enforce the same. No
waiver by a party of any condition or of any breach of any term, covenant,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be effective
unless in writing, and no waiver in any one or more instances shall be deemed
to be a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach in other
instances or a waiver of any other condition or breach of any other term,
covenant, representation or warranty.   14.6 Counterparts and Execution.
This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one
and the same agreement and shall become effective when two or more
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other parties. Any counterpart may be executed by facsimile signature and
such facsimile signature shall be deemed an original.   14.7 Headings. The
headings preceding the text of the Articles, Sections, paragraphs and other
headings of this Agreement and the Schedules hereto are for convenience of
reference only and shall not be deemed part of or in any way affect the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   14.8 APPLICABLE LAW AND
JURISDICTION; DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION.   (a) THIS AGREEMENT (AND ALL
DOCUMENTS, INSTRUMENTS, AND AGREEMENTS EXECUTED AND DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THE
TERMS AND PROVISIONS HEREOF (COLLECTIVELY, THE "ANCILLARY DOCUMENTS")) SHALL
BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE BANKRUPTCY
CODE AND TO THE EXTENT NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE BANKRUPTCY CODE, THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF DELAWARE APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED
WHOLLY WITHIN SUCH JURISDICTION. PURCHASER AND SELLERS FURTHER AGREE THAT THE
BANKRUPTCY COURT SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OVER ALL DISPUTES AND
OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO (A) THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY DOCUMENT; AND/OR (B) THE ACQUIRED ASSETS AND/OR
ASSUMED LIABILITIES, AND PURCHASER EXPRESSLY CONSENTS TO AND AGREES NOT TO
CONTEST SUCH EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION. SUBJECT TO SECTION 13.3(d), THE PARTIES
AGREE THAT NO COURT SHALL HAVE THE POWER TO AWARD CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR
PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS) UNLESS THE APPLICABLE COURT
DETERMINES THAT THIS LIMITATION, UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, VIOLATES PUBLIC
POLICY.    79    (b) If the Bankruptcy Court does not have (or abstains
from) jurisdiction with respect to any dispute, Purchaser and Sellers agree
that, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, any dispute between
the parties relating to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, shall be
resolved by final binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), to be
conducted in New York, New York. The arbitration shall be conducted by one
arbitrator mutually agreed to by the parties hereto within 15 days of the
written notification by one party to the other of a dispute under this
Agreement. If the parties cannot reach mutual agreement within such 15 day
period, each party shall have an additional 5 day period to provide written
notification to the other party of an arbitrator selected by such party. Each
arbitrator selected by each party shall have an additional 10-day period to
select a third arbitrator who shall be the sole arbitrator to resolve such
disputed claim. Each arbitrator shall be selected from the AAA with
distribution industry experience. Notwithstanding the foregoing, three
arbitrators shall be employed (one chosen by each party and a third chosen by
the arbitrators chosen by each party) with respect to any dispute involving a
claim in excess of $1,000,000. Absent a showing of good cause, the hearing
shall be conducted within 90 days from the service of the statement of claim.
All proceedings shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Each party
shall bear the expense of their own attorneys, experts and out of pocket
costs as well as fifty percent of the expense of administration
and arbitrator fees. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if for
any reason the provision of this Section 14.8(b) regarding arbitration of
disputes should be determined to be unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction, the parties irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Bankruptcy Court so long as the Chapter 11 Case is proceeding pursuant to
Section 14.8(a) above.   14.9 Binding Nature; Assignment. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
by any of the parties hereto without prior written consent of the other
parties (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) except (i) that
Purchaser may assign any of its rights hereunder and delegate its obligations
to one or more Third Party Purchasers in accordance with Section 2.6 or to
any Affiliate or wholly owned Subsidiary (a "Purchaser Assignee"), (ii) that
Purchaser may grant a security interest in its rights and interests hereunder
to its lenders, (iii) that the rights and interests hereunder may be assigned
to a trustee appointed under chapter 11 or chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code,
(iv) that this Agreement may be assigned to any entity appointed as successor
to Sellers pursuant to a confirmed chapter 11 plan, and (v) as otherwise
provided in this Agreement. In order to effect the provisions of the
preceding sentence, Sellers shall, if requested by Purchaser, execute one or
more necessary documents or amendments to this Agreement making Third Party
Purchasers parties hereto. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, is
intended to confer on any Person other than the parties hereto or their
successors and assigns, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement.   14.10 No Third Party Beneficiaries.
This Agreement is solely for the benefit of the parties hereto and no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to confer upon Third Parties any
rights, remedies, claims, or causes of action other than a Third Party
Purchaser.   14.11 Parent Guarantee. In consideration of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Parent hereby unconditionally
guarantees to Sellers that Purchaser will duly and     80   punctually
pay and/or perform, as the case may be, all obligations and undertakings of
Purchaser or Purchaser Assignee under this Agreement, including, without
limitation, all obligations and undertakings of Purchaser under Section 3.1.
Under this guarantee, Sellers shall be entitled to seek recourse
directly from the Parent, without first seeking any available recourse from
Purchaser or Purchaser Assignee.   14.12 Construction. The language used in
this Agreement will be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties to
this Agreement to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Any reference to any
federal, state, local, or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise.   14.13 Public Announcements. Except as required by Law
or in connection with the Chapter 11 Case, subject to Section 12.10 prior to
the Initial Closing, neither Sellers nor Purchaser shall issue any press
release or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
party hereto relating to the contents and manner of presentation and
publication thereof, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Prior to making any public disclosure required by applicable law,
the disclosing parties shall give the other party a copy of the proposed
disclosure and reasonable opportunity to comment on the same.   14.14
Entire Understanding. This Agreement, the annexes, the exhibits, the
Disclosure Schedule and other schedules hereto, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Supply Agreement, dated June 27, 2003, between Purchaser and Fleming
(the "Supply Agreement"), the Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale Order set
forth the entire agreement and understanding of the parties hereto in respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and this Agreement, the annexes,
exhibits, the Disclosure Schedule and the other schedules hereto, hereto
supersede all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings relating to
the subject matter hereof and are not intended to confer upon any
other Person other than the parties hereto any rights and annexes remedies,
claims or courses of action hereunder. There have been no representations or
statements, oral or written, that have been relied on by any party hereto,
except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, and annexes, the
exhibits, the Disclosure Schedule and the other schedules hereto.   14.15
Bulk Sales Laws. Purchaser and Sellers waive compliance with applicable Laws
under any version of Article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code adopted by any
state or any similar law relating to the sale of inventory, equipment or
other assets in bulk in connection with the sale of the Business, the
Acquired Assets or the operation of the PSCs.   14.16 Severability. Any term
or provision of this Agreement that is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any
situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or
in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction or other authority declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid, void or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to reduce the scope, duration, area or
applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases,
or to     81   replace any invalid, void or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision.   14.17 Election of Remedies. Except for Indemnifiable
Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out of the maters described in
Section 13.2(a)(i) whose remedies shall be limited as set forth in Article
XIII and except as provided in Section 13.3(f) for all other Indemnifiable
Losses, neither the exercise of nor the failure to exercise a right of set-
off or to give notice of a claim under this Agreement will constitute an
election of remedies or limit an party hereto in any manner in the
enforcement of any other remedies that may be available to it, whether at law
or in equity. The right to indemnification or other remedies based on any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Sellers contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation
conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired) by Purchaser at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation. The parties acknowledge that monetary damages would
not be sufficient to remedy any breach of Section 2.5, and each party shall
be entitled to specific performance of any breach of such Section 2.5.   * *
