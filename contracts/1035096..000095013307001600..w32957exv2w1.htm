the date that is twelve (12)&nbsp;Business Days after the date of this Agreement (the &#147;<U>Outside
Commencement Date</U>&#148;)), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within

condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to

Sub (together with their wholly-owned subsidiaries), represents at least a majority of the Shares
then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (the &#147;<U>Minimum Condition</U>&#148;) and to the other
conditions set forth in Annex I. Merger Subsidiary expressly reserves the right to waive any of
the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer;
<I>provided </I>that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in
writing, (i)&nbsp;the Minimum Condition may not be waived, (ii)&nbsp;no change may be made that changes the
form of consideration to be paid, decreases the Offer Price or the number of Shares sought in the
Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I or otherwise
amends or modifies the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares and (iii)&nbsp;the Offer may
not be extended except as set forth in this <U>Section&nbsp;1.1(a)</U>. Subject to the prior
satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub of the Minimum Condition, with the written consent
of the Company, and the other conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex I, Merger Sub shall
consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all Shares
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after Merger Sub
is legally permitted to do so under Applicable Law. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that is 20 business
days (calculated in accordance with Rule&nbsp;14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that
the Offer is commenced. Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for successive periods of up to twenty
(20)&nbsp;Business Days each (1)&nbsp;if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, any of
the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived, from time to time, until the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;5.1 <U>Organization and Good Standing</U>. Parent is a stock corporation
(Aktiengesellschaft) duly registered with the Commercial Register in Darmstadt, Germany, and is
validly existing under the laws of Germany. Merger Sub (i)&nbsp;is a corporation duly organized,

as a foreign corporation and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize such
concept) in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it
or the nature of its business makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or licensed would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;5.2 <U>Authority for Agreement</U>. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary

The execution, delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement, and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other corporate
proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, and no other votes or approvals of any class or

forth a true, accurate and complete copy of an executed commitment letter (as the same may be
amended or replaced in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;6.11</U>, the &#147;<U>Commitment Letter</U>&#148;) from
Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft (as the same may be substituted or replaced in accordance with

conditions thereof, the Lender has committed to lend the amount set forth therein to Parent and
Merger Sub for the purpose of funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
&#147;<U>Financing</U>&#148;). The Commitment Letter, in the
form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Lender. Except as
permitted by <U>Section&nbsp;6.11</U> as to matters occurring after the date hereof, the Commitment
Letter has not been amended, modified, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. No event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any term or condition of the Commitment Letter. Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub has any reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
any term or condition of the closing to be satisfied by it contained in the Commitment Letter.
Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the
Commitment Letter to be paid on or before the date of this Agreement. The Financing is sufficient
to pay the aggregate consideration to be paid in the Offer and the Merger and the aggregate Option
Consideration, to allow Parent and Merger Sub to perform all of their other obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate all the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and pay all fees
and expenses to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. There are no contractual contingencies, side letters or similar arrangements under any
