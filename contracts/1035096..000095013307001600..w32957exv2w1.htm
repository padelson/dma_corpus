AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), is entered into as of this 4th day of April 2007, by and among Software AG, a stock corporation (Aktiengesellschaft) organized under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany (" _Parent_ "), Wizard Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and webMethods, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each have determined that it is advisable, fair to and in the best interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, Merger Sub has agreed to commence a tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of the Company, including the associated share purchase rights (each, a " _Right_ ") under the Companys Rights Agreement dated as of October 18, 2001, by and between the Company and American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as rights agent, (the " _Rights Plan_ ") (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), but excluding any Company Restricted Stock (as defined herein), at a price of $9.15 per share, net to the seller in cash (such amount, or any higher amount per share offered pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Offer Price_ "), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub shall merge with and into the Company with the Company surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ "), and each share of Company Common Stock that is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer will thereupon be canceled and converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board of Directors_ ") has (i) determined that this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, taken together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders_ ") and (ii) adopted resolutions approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, declaring their advisability and recommending the adoption by the Company Stockholders of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby; and 

  

 WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, taken together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, advisable and in the best interests of Merger Sub and its sole stockholder and (ii) adopted resolutions approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, declaring their advisability and recommending the adoption by its sole stockholder of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the sole stockholder of Merger Sub will adopt this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement, each of the executive officers and directors of the Company are entering into Tender and Support Agreements substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto (the " _Tender and Support Agreements_ "). 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises herein made, and in consideration of the representations, warranties and covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

 _THE OFFER_   

  

 Section 1.1 _The Offer_. 

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (and in no event later than the date that is twelve (12) Business Days after the date of this Agreement (the " _Outside Commencement Date_ ")), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer. The Offer shall be subject to the condition that there shall be validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offer, prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (as it may be extended hereunder) and not properly withdrawn, a number of Shares that, together with the Shares then owned beneficially by Parent and/or Merger Sub (together with their wholly-owned subsidiaries), represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (the " _Minimum Condition_ ") and to the other conditions set forth in Annex I. Merger Subsidiary expressly reserves the right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer;  _provided_ that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or previously approved by the Company in writing, (i) the Minimum Condition may not be waived, (ii) no change may be made that changes the form of consideration to be paid, decreases the Offer Price or the number of Shares sought in the Offer, imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those set forth in Annex I or otherwise amends or modifies the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of Shares and (iii) the Offer may not be extended except as set forth in this _Section 1.1(a)_. Subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Merger Sub of the Minimum Condition, with the written consent of the Company, and the other conditions of the Offer set forth in Annex I, Merger Sub shall consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and pay for all Shares tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable after Merger Sub is legally permitted to do so under Applicable Law. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at midnight, New York City time, on the date that is 20 business days (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that the Offer is commenced. Merger Sub shall extend the Offer for successive periods of up to twenty (20) Business Days each (1) if, at the scheduled or extended expiration date of the Offer, any of the conditions to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived, from time to time, until the earliest to occur of (x) the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions and (y) the Outside Termination Date and (2) for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by Applicable Law. Following expiration 

   ##### 

  

    

of the Offer, Merger Sub may, in its sole discretion, provide for one or more
subsequent offering periods (together, the " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ")
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act, if, as of the
commencement of each such period, there shall not have been validly tendered
and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and any prior Subsequent
Offering Period that number of Shares necessary to permit the Merger to be
effected without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with
Section 253(a) of the DGCL. Subject to the foregoing, including the
requirements of Rule 14d-11, and upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept
for payment all Shares (A) validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer after the final expiration of the Offer, with payment for such Shares
to be made as promptly as practicable after the final expiration of the Offer
and (B) validly tendered in any Subsequent Offering Period, with payment for
such Shares to be made as promptly as practicable after such Shares are
validly tendered. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly
tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer or validly tendered in any
Subsequent Offering Period shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash,
subject to reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes. 

  

 (b) As soon as practicable on the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i) file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_") that shall include the summary term sheet required thereby and, as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase and forms of a letter of transmittal and summary advertisement, if any, in respect of the Offer and other ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively, together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in writing all information concerning the Company that may be required by applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and to correct any material omissions in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents as so corrected to be disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents each time before any such document is filed with the SEC, and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments made by the Company and its counsel. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with (A) any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or Offer Documents promptly after receipt of those comments or other communications and (B) a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of Parent and Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given), including by participating with Parent and Merger Sub or their counsel in any discussions or meetings with the SEC. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the 

   ##### 

  

    

purchase of the Shares in the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
return, and shall cause any depository or paying agent acting on behalf of
Parent and Merger Sub to return, all tendered Shares to the holders entitled
thereto. 

  

 (c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer and shall cause Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations hereunder. 

  

 Section 1.2 _Company Action_. 

  

 (a) Subject to _Section 6.6_, the Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that the Company Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this Agreement at which substantially all directors of the Company were present, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the Company Stockholders, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and declared this Agreement advisable, in accordance with the requirements of the DGCL, (iii) approved and adopted an amendment to the Rights Plan to cause the provisions of the Rights Plan not to be applicable to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby and to provide for the expiration of the Rights upon the consummation of the Merger and (iv) recommended that the Company Stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Merger Sub pursuant to the Offer and, if applicable, approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the foregoing determinations and approvals in the Offer Documents and, to the extent that no Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred in accordance with _Section 6.6_, the Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation referenced in clause (iv) of the immediately preceding sentence. The Company has been advised that its executive officers and directors who own Shares intend to tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer in accordance with the terms of the Tender and Support Agreement. The Company shall cause its transfer agent to promptly furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, as of the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in connection with communicating the Offer to record and beneficial holders of Shares in accordance with this Agreement and applicable U.S. federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall treat the information contained in such lists, labels and files and any additional information referred to in the preceding sentence as confidential in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 (b) On the date that the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities Laws, a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that, subject to _Section 6.6_, shall reflect the recommendations of the Company Board of Directors referred to above. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly 

   ##### 

  

    

furnish to the Company in writing all information concerning Parent and
Merger Sub that may be required by applicable securities Laws or reasonably
requested by the Company for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees promptly to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect and to
correct any material omissions in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to
be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Shares with the
Offer Documents, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
U.S. federal securities Laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 prior to
its filing with the SEC, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith
consideration to any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel.
The Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel with (i) any
comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that the Company
or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of those comments
or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to participate in
the Companys response to those comments and to provide comments on that
response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration shall be given),
including by participating with the Company or its counsel in any discussions
or meetings with the SEC. 

  

 Section 1.3 _Directors_. 

  

 (a) Promptly upon the acceptance for payment of any Shares pursuant to the Offer, and from time to time thereafter (including, without limitation, upon acceptance of Shares tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period), Merger Sub shall be entitled to designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Company Board of Directors as will give Merger Sub representation on the Company Board of Directors equal to the greater of (i) the product of (x) the total number of directors on the Company Board of Directors (after giving effect to any increase in the number of directors pursuant to this _Section 1.3_) and (y) the percentage that the number of Shares owned by Merger Sub (when combined with all Shares owned by Parent and its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) bears to the total number of Shares outstanding and (ii) the number of directors that, after their designation by Merger Sub, constitutes a majority of the Company Board of Directors, and the Company shall in each case promptly increase the size of the Company Board of Directors or use its reasonable best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors as is necessary to provide Merger Sub with such level of representation and shall cause Merger Subs designees to be so elected or appointed. The Company shall also use its reasonable best efforts to cause individuals designated by Merger Sub to constitute the same percentage of each committee of the Company Board of Directors as the percentage of the entire Company Board of Directors represented by individuals designated by Merger Sub. The Companys obligations to appoint designees to the Company Board of Directors shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company shall take all actions necessary to effect any such election or appointment of Merger Subs designees, including mailing to its stockholders the information required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l promulgated thereunder which, unless Merger Sub otherwise elects, shall be so mailed together with the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Merger Sub will supply to the Company all information with respect to themselves and their respective officers, directors 

   ##### 

  

    

and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-l
promulgated thereunder. 

  

 (b) Following the election or appointment of Merger Subs designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment or termination of this Agreement requiring action by the Company Board of Directors, any extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement, any waiver of compliance with any of the agreements or conditions under this Agreement that are for the benefit of the Company, any exercise of the Companys rights or remedies under this Agreement, any action to seek to enforce any obligation of Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement (or any other action by the Company Board of Directors with respect to this Agreement or the Merger if such other action adversely affects, or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect, any of the holders of Shares other than Parent or Merger Sub) may only be authorized by, and will require the authorization of, a majority of the directors of the Company then in office who are directors of the Company on the date hereof or their successors as appointed by such continuing directors (the " _Continuing Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if there shall be no Continuing Directors as a result of such individuals deaths, disabilities, resignations or refusal to serve, then such actions may be effected by majority vote of the directors who are considered "independent directors" within the meaning of the Nasdaqs corporate governance rules and applicable U.S. federal securities Laws, or, if no such directors are then in office, by a majority vote of the Company Board of Directors. Between the time Merger Sub becomes entitled to designate directors pursuant to this _Section 1.3_ and the Effective Time, none of Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates shall take any action to remove a Continuing Director from office. 

  

 Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_. 

  

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company hereby irrevocably grants to Merger Sub an option (the " _Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only after the acceptance by Merger Sub of, and payment for, Shares tendered in the Offer and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 1.4_, to purchase that number (but not less than that number) of shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") equal to the lowest number of shares that, when added to the number of Shares directly or indirectly owned by Parent or Merger Sub or their Subsidiaries at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than 90% of the Shares (taking into account the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares) at a price per share equal to the Offer Price; _provided_ that (i) the Top-Up Option shall be exercisable only once, on or prior to the earlier to occur of the 21st business day (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the expiration date of the Offer or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, (ii) in no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares (x) in excess of the then authorized and unissued shares of Company Common Stock (giving effect, for purposes of this _Section 1.4_ , to shares reserved for issuance under any Employee Benefit Plan as if such shares were outstanding) or (y) that would require the Company to obtain the approval of its stockholders under Applicable Law or any Nasdaq rule or regulation, (iii) the Top-Up Option may not be exercised if any provision of Applicable Law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree of any Governmental Entity shall prohibit, or require any action, consent, approval, authorization or permit of, action by, or filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity or the Companys 

   ##### 

  

    

stockholders in connection with the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, which
action, consent, approval, authorization or permit, action, filing or
notification has not theretofore been obtained or made, as applicable. 

  

 (b) If Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise Notice_ ", and the date of receipt of such notice the " _Top-Up Notice Date_ ") specifying the place for the closing of the purchase and sale of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to Merger Sub confirming (i) the number of Shares then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, and (ii) the number of Top-Up Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor. 

  

 (c) At the Top-Up Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Merger Sub a certificate or certificates evidencing the applicable number of Top-Up Option Shares, and Merger Sub shall purchase each Top-Up Option Share from the Company at a price per Share equal to the Offer Price. Payment by Merger Sub of the purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares may be made, at Merger Subs option, by delivery of immediately available funds by wire transfer to an account designated by the Company. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements, including all federal securities Laws. 

  

 (d) Upon the delivery by Merger Sub to the Company of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, and the tender of the consideration described in Section 1.4(c), Merger Sub shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Top-Up Option Shares issuable upon that exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company shall then be closed or that certificates representing those Top-Up Option Shares shall not then be actually delivered to Merger Sub or the Company shall have failed or refused to designate the account described in _Section 1.4(c)_. 

  

 (e) Any certificates evidencing Top-Up Option Shares may include any legends required by applicable securities Laws. 

  

 (f) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top- Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act).

 Section 2.5 _Conversion of the Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) Except as provided in _Section 2.5(b)_ or _Section 2.5(c)_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Appraisal Shares) (the " _Shares_ ") shall be canceled and shall by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof be converted automatically into the right to receive an amount equal to the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon surrender of the Certificate representing such Shares as provided in  _Article III_. All such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to 

   ##### 

  

    

receive the Merger Consideration into which such Shares have been converted,

 (b) Each Share that is owned by the Company (or any Subsidiary of the Company) as treasury stock or otherwise and each Share owned by Parent or Merger Sub (whether as a result of the Offer or otherwise) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired and cease to exist and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 Section 2.8 _Company Stock Options_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option under or pursuant to any Company Option Plans that is outstanding, unexercised and unexpired, prior to the Effective Time shall be accelerated in full so that each such Company Stock Option is fully vested and exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time.

   ##### 

  

    

and (y) the Merger Consideration less the per share exercise price of such
Company Stock Option (the " _Option Consideration_ ") (it being understood and
agreed that such exercise price shall not actually be paid to the Company by

to any holder of a Company Stock Option is equal to or less than zero, it
shall be understood and agreed that any such Company Stock Option shall
be canceled and extinguished immediately upon to the Effective Time without
any payment. Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay
to holders of Company Stock Options the Option Consideration, less applicable
Taxes required to be deducted and withheld with respect to such payments, as
soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in any case within ten
(10) Business Days thereafter. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of such Company Stock
Options to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

  

 (b) Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, the Company Option Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof shall be canceled as of the Effective Time.

 Section 2.9 _Restricted Stock; Deferred Compensation Plan_. 

  

 (a) If any share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time is unvested or subject to a repurchase option or forfeiture in favor of the Company (any such shares, " _Company Restricted Stock_ "), then, effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Company Restricted Stock shall be fully vested and any repurchase option or forfeiture restriction shall lapse. 

  

 (b) Prior to the Effective Time, all accrued account balances under the Companys Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors (the " _Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") shall be distributed pursuant to Section 5.B of such plan. Shares of Company Common Stock so distributed under the Deferred Compensation Plan shall be subject to _Section 2.5_ of this Agreement.

 Section 2.11 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any Appraisal Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.5(a)_, but instead such holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the rights to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to an appraisal of such holders Shares under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.5(a)_, without interest. The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal of any of the Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), or as otherwise required under the DGCL, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 (b) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and executed, and any other documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, (i) the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check representing the applicable amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.5_ and (ii) the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration. 

  

 (c) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is presented to the Paying Agent properly endorsed or accompanied by appropriate stock powers and otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes have been paid. 

  

 Section 3.3 _No Further Ownership Transfers_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of the Certificates representing Shares in accordance with the terms 

   ##### 

  

    

hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Shares and, after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article III_, subject to applicable Law in
the case of Appraisal Shares. 

  

 Section 3.4 _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed to the former Company Stockholders on the date 365 days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any former holder of Shares who has not theretofore received any applicable Merger Consideration to which such Company Stockholder is entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of claims with respect thereto and only as a general creditor thereof. 

  

 Section 3.5 _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Merger Sub shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any part of the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such Shares at such date as is immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law or Order, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto. 

  

 Section 3.6 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by and at the discretion of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, or the execution and delivery by such Person of an indemnity agreement in such form as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may direct, in each case as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the appropriate amount of the Merger Consideration. 

  

 Section 3.7 _Withholding of Tax_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares, Appraisal Shares or Company Stock Options such amount as Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent is legally required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of Law relating to Taxes. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation, any Affiliate thereof or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be (a) paid over to the applicable Governmental Entity in accordance with applicable Law or Order and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 Section 5.2 _Authority for Agreement_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement thereof may be limited against Parent or Merger Sub by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights or remedies in general as from time to time in effect or (b) the exercise by courts of equity powers. 

  

 Section 5.3 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_. 

  

 (a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with or violate Parents organizational or charter documents, or the equivalent charter documents of Merger Sub, (ii) conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent or its Subsidiaries or by which any material property or asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or affected, or (iii) result in a breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, give to others (immediately or with notice or lapse of time or both) any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, result

property or asset of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, is bound or affected,

otherwise prohibit or interfere with the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger. 

  

 (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub do not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification to, or registration or qualification with, any Governmental Entity, except for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or state securities laws or "blue sky" laws, any Antitrust Law, Exon-Florio and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger, as required by the DGCL.

Except as permitted by _Section 6.11_ as to matters occurring after the date hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been amended, modified, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or Merger Sub under any term or condition of the Commitment Letter.

during any such inspection. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary of the Company shall be required to provide access to any
information, property or personnel if (X) the Company believes in good faith
that such access is subject to any confidentiality obligations or would be
reasonably likely to jeopardize the Companys attorney-client, work product
or similar legal privilege; (Y) any applicable Law (including U.S. and
international antitrust or competition laws) requires the Company to restrict
or prohibit access to any such information, properties or personnel; or (Z)
such access would materially and unreasonably disrupt the businesses and
operations of the Company. 

  

 Section 6.3 _Reasonable Efforts; Notification_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to fulfill all conditions applicable to such party pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including (i) obtaining all necessary, proper or advisable actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, qualifications and approvals from Governmental Entities and making all necessary, proper or advisable registrations, filings and notifications and taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval, clearance, non-action letter, waiver or exemption from any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, under the HSR Act and Exon-Florio); (ii) obtaining all necessary, proper or advisable consents, qualifications, approvals, waivers or exemptions from non-governmental Third Parties; and (iii) executing and delivering any additional documents or instruments necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, the Transaction Documents.

submit a draft of a joint Exon-Florio notification to the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States (" _CFIUS_ ") no later than one
(1) Business Day following the date hereof, (B) submit a joint Exon-Florio
notification to CFIUS as soon as practicable, but in any event no later than
ten (10) Business Days, following the date hereof and (C) make any other
submissions under Exon-Florio that are required to be made or which the
Company and Parent mutually agree should be made as soon as practicable
following the date hereof, in each case, in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall cooperate with one another (A) in promptly determining
whether any filings are required to be or should be made or consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or should be obtained
under any other federal, state or foreign Law or regulation or whether any
consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be obtained from
other parties to loan agreements or other contracts or instruments
material to the Companys business in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) in promptly making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking to obtain timely any such consents, permits,
authorizations, approvals or waivers. 

   

 (c) The Company, Parent, and Merger Sub shall cooperate with each other in connection with the making of all such filings, including providing copies of all such documents to the non-filing party and its advisors prior to filing and, if requested, accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith. The Company, Parent, and Merger Sub shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant to any Law (including all information required to be included in the Offer Documents and the Company Disclosure Documents) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party hereto shall (i) give the other parties hereto prompt notice upon obtaining Knowledge of the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) keep the other parties hereto reasonably informed as to the status of any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, and (iii) promptly inform the other parties hereto of any material communication to or from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice, any foreign competition authority or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto, including reasonable access to any materials submitted pursuant to any Second Request or in connection with any other proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. Any party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other parties under this section as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the source of the materials. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, each party hereto will permit authorized Representatives of the other parties to be present at each meeting or telephone conference with representatives of any Governmental Entity relating to any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be consulted in connection   ##### 

  

  

  

with any document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental
Entity in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or proceeding. 

   

 (d) Without limiting any other obligations of Parent hereunder, Parent shall agree to the acceptance of any reasonable restrictions imposed by any Governmental Entity as a result of the CFIUS review on the business or operations of the Company or its subsidiaries or the control thereof by Parent (" _Reasonable Restrictions_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that under no circumstances shall any of the restrictions set forth in of the Section 6.3(d) Company Disclosure Schedules be deemed to be "Reasonable Restrictions". Except for the obligation to accept Reasonable Restrictions as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, nothing in this Agreement shall, as a result of the CFIUS review, require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Parent agree or offer to: (i) effect any divestiture of, or hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or agree to restrict its ownership or operation of, any business or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its Subsidiaries, or to enter into any settlement or consent decree, or agree to any undertaking, with respect to any business or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) enter into, amend or agree to enter into or amend, any contract, agreement, license or other undertaking of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its Subsidiaries or (iii) otherwise waive, abandon or alter any rights or obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its Subsidiaries. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and except as set forth in Section 6.3(d), nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of Parent agree or offer to: (i) effect any divestiture of, or hold separate (including by establishing a trust or otherwise), or agree to restrict its ownership or operation of, any business or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its Subsidiaries, or to enter into any settlement or consent decree, or agree to any undertaking, with respect to any business or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its Subsidiaries, (ii) enter into, amend or agree to enter into or amend, any contract, agreement, license or other undertaking of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its Subsidiaries or (iii) otherwise waive, abandon or alter any rights or obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or of Parent or its Subsidiaries, except in each case as would not, individually or in the aggregate, materially diminish the benefits that would reasonably be expected to accrue to Parent from the Merger or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 (f) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and subject to all privileges (including the attorney client privilege), promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) notify the other party in writing of: 

   

 (i) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

   ##### 

  

  

 (iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to its Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to any of the representations and warranties contained herein, or that relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 (iv) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in Annex I hereto not to be satisfied; 

  

 (v) any failure of that party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; 

  

 _provided, however,_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.3(f) shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving that notice. 

  

 Section 6.4 _Proxy Statement_. 

  

 (a) If, following the consummation of the Offer (or, if applicable, any Subsequent Offering Period), the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders is required under the DGCL to consummate the Merger, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the consummation of the Offer, prepare and file with the SEC preliminary proxy materials which shall constitute the Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after comments are received from the SEC thereon and after the furnishing by the Company and Parent of all information required to be contained therein, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare and the Company shall file any required amendments to, and the definitive, Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall consult with Parent regarding, and supply Parent with copies of, all correspondence between the Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall use reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and shall thereafter mail to the Company Stockholders as promptly as possible the Proxy Statement and all other proxy materials for such meeting. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting there shall occur any event that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Company shall promptly prepare and mail to its stockholders such an amendment or supplement. 

  

 (b) Parent shall, following the date on which Stockholder Approval is determined to be required in accordance with this Section 6.4, furnish the Company with all information concerning Parent required for use in the Proxy Statement, and Parent shall take 

   ##### 

  

    

such other action as the Company may reasonably request in connection with
the preparation of the Proxy Statement, including any amendments or
supplements thereto. 

  

 (c) The Company and Parent shall make any necessary filings with respect to the Merger under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Company Stockholders Meeting_. If, following the consummation of the Offer (or, if applicable, any Subsequent Offering Period), the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders is required under the DGCL to consummate the Merger, the Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the consummation of the Offer, take all actions in accordance with Applicable Law, the Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the rules of Nasdaq to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to  _Section_   _6.6(c)_ , to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, (i) the Company Board of Directors shall declare this Agreement advisable and recommend adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the Company Stockholders and include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (ii) neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the recommendation of the Company Board of Directors that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger. Unless this Agreement has been duly terminated in accordance with the terms herein (including payment of any termination fees payable under _Article VIII_), the Company shall, subject to the right of the Company Board of Directors to modify its recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent under certain circumstances as specified in _Section 6.6(c)_, take all lawful action to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the proposal to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the Company Stockholders that are required by the rules of Nasdaq or the DGCL. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any legally required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the Company Stockholders or, if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting. 

  

 Section 6.6 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, Representatives and any other agents to, immediately cease any discussions, negotiations or communications with any party or parties with respect to any Alternative Transaction. 

   

 (b) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any Affiliate or Representative of the Company or its Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit, initiate or intentionally facilitate or encourage the submission of any Alternative Transaction or (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Third Party any information or data with respect to or provide access to the properties, offices, books, records, officers, directors or employees of, or 

    ##### 

  

    

take any other action to knowingly facilitate, induce or encourage the making
of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to,
any Alternative Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to the
consummation of the Offer (A) the Company has complied with this _Section
6.6_ and (B) the Company Board of Directors reasonably determines in good
faith that an Alternative Transaction constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then, to the extent such action is
consistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Company Board of Directors,
as determined in good faith by a majority thereof after consultation with the
Companys outside counsel, the Company may, subject to the
Companys providing prior written notice to Parent of its decision to take
such action and compliance by the Company with _Section 6.6(d)_, furnish
information with respect to the Company to, and participate in discussions
and negotiations directly or through its Representatives with, such Third
Party, subject to a confidentiality agreement not materially less favorable to
the Company than the Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which shall be
provided to Parent for informational purposes only). 

   

 (c) Neither the Company Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or resolve to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approval and recommendation by the Company Board of Directors of the Merger and this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and the actions taken in connection herewith and therewith, (ii) approve or recommend, or resolve to approve or recommend, any Alternative Transaction, (iii) approve or recommend, or resolve to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any Acquisition Agreement, (iv) approve or recommend, or resolve to approve or recommend, or execute or enter into, any agreement requiring it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger, this Agreement, any Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (v) agree or publicly announce any intention to do any of the foregoing constituting or related to, or that is intended to lead to, any Alternative Transaction (any of the foregoing in clauses (i) through (v), an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the consummation of the Offer, in response to a Superior Proposal that was not solicited, initiated, intentionally encouraged, participated in or otherwise facilitated by the Company in breach of _Section 6.6(b)_, the Company Board of Directors may, if it determines in good faith (after consulting with the Companys outside legal counsel) that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law or Order, (A) modify or resolve to modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the approvals and recommendations of the Company Board of Directors of the Offer, the Merger, or the transactions contemplated hereby or by the Transaction Documents (or otherwise make any Adverse Recommendation Change), or (B) terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(c)_. 

   

 (d) In addition to the obligations set forth in _Sections 6.6(a)_, _(b)_ and  _(c)_ , the Company shall advise Parent orally and, if requested by Parent, in writing of (i) the existence of an Alternative Transaction or any offer, proposal or inquiry with respect to or which could reasonably be expected to lead to an Alternative Transaction received by any officer or director of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, other Representative of the Company and (ii) the material terms and conditions of such Alternative Transaction, and any amendment or modification thereto, including the identity of the Person proposing such Alternative Transaction, within one Business Day following receipt by the Company or any officer or 

  ##### 

  

    

director of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any other
Representative of the Company of such offer, proposal or inquiry. The Company
shall keep Parent fully informed, on a current basis, of the status and
material details of any such offer, proposal or inquiry. In addition, the
Company Board of Directors shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement for purposes of entering into an agreement with
respect to an Alternative Transaction unless (x) the Company notifies Parent,
in writing at least three Business Days before taking such action, of
its intention to do so in response to an offer, proposal or inquiry to enter
into an Alternative Transaction that it has determined constitutes a Superior
Proposal and attaching the most current version of any proposed agreement or
a summary of all material terms of any such proposal and the identity of the
offeror, (y) the Company shall have, during such three Business Day
period, negotiated in good faith with Parent with respect to any changes to
this Agreement that Parent shall have proposed and (z) Parent does not make,
within three Business Days after its receipt of that written notification, an
offer that is at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as
such Superior Proposal, it being understood that the Company shall not enter
into any binding agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal during such
three Business Day period. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.6_ or any other provision hereof shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party that is consistent with its obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board of Directors may either, except as provided by _Section 6.6(c)_, make an Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

 Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law or Order or the applicable rules of Nasdaq or any listing agreement if it has used its commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain such partys consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press release or public statement is so required to be issued or made. 

  

 Section 6.8 _Litigation_. Subject to _Section 6.3(d)_, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging, or seeking damages or other relief as a result of, the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, including seeking to have any Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents entered by any court or other Governmental Entity promptly vacated or reversed. 

  

 Section 6.9 _Employee Benefit Matters_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor and provide for payment of all accrued obligations and benefits under all Company Benefit Plans set forth, and identified as such, in the Company Disclosure Schedules (including, without limitation, employment or severance agreements between the Company and Persons who are or had been employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time), all in accordance with their respective terms. 

   

 (b) Parent will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, each Company Employee with compensation (including bonus and incentive compensation opportunities, but excluding equity-based compensation) and employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and employee benefits provided to Parents similarly-situated employees employed in the same country as such Company Employee (or, if Parent has no employees employed in such country, as provided to such Company Employee) as of the Closing Date, as the same may be modified or adjusted from time to time thereafter. For purposes of the Parent Benefit Plans, Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause Company Employees to receive credit for past service with the Company for purposes of accrual of vacation time and for purposes of eligibility for participation, vesting, and benefit accrual under the applicable Parent Benefit Plans;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. 

   

 (c) For purposes of the Parent Benefit Plans, Parent shall use its reasonable efforts to cause the waiver of all actively-at-work or similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any Parent Benefit Plan that is a group health plan with respect to such Company Employees and their eligible dependents, in each case, to the same extent as service with the Company or its Subsidiaries was taken into account under the comparable Company Benefit Plan, and credit shall be provided for any co-payments, deductibles and offsets (or similar payments) made under Company Benefit Plans for the portion of the applicable plan year prior to the Effective Time for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any Parent Benefit Plans in which they become eligible to participate after the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will have sole discretion over the hiring, promotion, retention, firing and other terms and conditions of the employment of employees of the Surviving Corporation. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.9_, nothing herein shall prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, from amending or terminating any Parent Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms. 

   

 Section 6.10 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify, advance expenses to and hold harmless all past and present officers and directors of the Company for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other Applicable Law or provided under the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws in effect on the date hereof; provided that such indemnification shall be subject to any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law. Parent shall guarantee such performance by the Surviving Corporation.   ##### 

  

  

  

The certificate of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
will contain provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses that are at least as favorable to the indemnified
parties as those contained in the Company Certificate of Incorporation and the
Company Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of not less than six
years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company, unless
such a modification is required by Law. 

   

 (b) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect (or Parent may instead elect to maintain pursuant to Parents policy or policies) for the benefit of the Companys current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that is substantially equivalent to the Companys existing policy on terms with respect to coverage in the aggregate no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof, or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an aggregate premium for such insurance in excess of 250% of the last annual premiums paid prior to the date hereof (which premiums the Company has disclosed to Parent), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount. 

   

 (c) This _Section 6.10_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each indemnified party, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation and Parent, and shall be enforceable by the indemnified parties. If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merger into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or shall cease to continue to exist for any reason or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation and the transferee or transferees of such properties and assets, as applicable, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_. The provisions of this  _Section 6.10_ are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each indemnified party, his or her heirs, and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. 

   

 Section 6.11 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange for the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter; (ii) enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing, which agreements shall be in effect as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in no event later than the Closing; (iii) satisfy all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in such definitive agreements; and (iv) consummate the Financing no later than the Outside Termination Date. Parent may, in its sole discretion, obtain or seek to obtain substitute or replacement Financing from one or more alternative Lenders; _provided_ , that any such substitute or replacement Financing shall be on   ##### 

  

  

  

comparable or more favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable
good-faith judgment of Parent) than the terms of the Financing being replaced
and shall not have an adverse effect on Parents ability to consummate the
Offer or the Merger. Solely in the event that any portion of the Financing
becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the
Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any
such unavailable portion from alternative sources on comparable or more
favorable terms to Parent (as determined in the reasonable good-faith
judgment of Parent) as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of
such event but in no event later than the Outside Termination Date. Parent
shall promptly provide the Company with the documentation evidencing any
replacement or alternative sources of financing and shall give the Company
prompt notice (but in any event within two Business Days) of any material
breach by any party to the Commitment Letter or any termination of
the Commitment Letter. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
for the Financing (or replacements thereof) and shall not permit any material
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any material
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter (or replacements thereof)
without first consulting with the Company or, if such amendment would or
would be reasonably expected to prevent, delay or hinder Parent and/or Merger
Subs ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
without first obtaining the Companys prior written consent which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt,
if the Financing (or any replacement or alternative financing) has not been
obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall continue to be obligated to consummate
the Offer and the Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in 
_Annex I_ hereto and to Parents rights and obligations under _Sections
8.1(b)_,  _(d)_ , _(e)_ and _(f)_. 

   

 (b) The Company shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to provide all reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably required by Parent; _provided_ that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or the Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith, except for any liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties that arise out of or relate to (i) information furnished to Parent by the Company for use in connection with the Financing or (ii) information contained in the Company SEC Reports. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the condition set forth in paragraph (e) of Annex I of this Agreement, as it applies to the Companys obligations under this _Section 6.11(b)_ , shall be deemed satisfied unless the Financing (or any alternative financing) has not been obtained primarily as a result of the Companys willful and material breach of its obligations under this _Section 6.11(b)_. 

   

 (c) All non-public information or Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) regarding the Company obtained by Parent or its Representatives   ##### 

  

  

  

pursuant to _Section 6.11(b)_ above shall be kept confidential in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

ARTICLE VII 

   

 _CONDITIONS PRECEDENT_   

  

 Section 7.1 _Conditions to Each Party s Obligation to Effect the Merger_. The obligations of the parties to effect the Merger on the Closing Date are subject to the satisfaction or waiver on or prior to the Closing Date of the following conditions: 

  

 (a) if required by the DGCL, the Company Stockholder Vote shall have been obtained; 

   

 (b) no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other Order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint or prohibition preventing the consummation of the Merger shall be in effect; and there shall not be any governmental action taken, or any statute, rule, regulation or Order enacted, entered, enforced or deemed applicable to the Merger, which makes the consummation of the Merger illegal; and 

   

 (c) Merger Sub shall have accepted for payment and paid for all of the Shares validly tendered pursuant to the Offer and not withdrawn. 

   

ARTICLE VIII 

   

 _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_
