action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and
the intentions of the Parties, each of the Parties will take such further
action (including the execution and delivery of such further instruments
and documents) as any other Party reasonably may request, all at the sole
cost and expense of the requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is
entitled to indemnification therefor under **Section 8**  below).

  

## (b) **_Litigation Support_**. In the event and for so long as any
Party actively is contesting or defending against any action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in
connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii)
any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition, activity, practice,
plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction on
or prior to the Closing Date involving NLASCO or any of its Subsidiaries,
each of the other Parties shall cooperate with him, her, or it and his, her,
or its counsel in the contest or defense, make available his, her, or its
personnel, and provide such testimony and access to his, her, or its books
and records as shall be necessary in connection with the contest or defense,
all at the sole cost and expense of the contesting or defending Party (unless
the contesting or defending Party is entitled to indemnification therefor
under **Section 8** below).

  

## (c) **_Transition_**. No Seller will take any action that is designed or
intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer,
supplier, or other business associate of NLASCO or any of its Subsidiaries
from maintaining the same business relationships with NLASCO and its
Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with NLASCO and
its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Each Seller shall cooperate with the
reasonable requests of Buyer in promptly delivering, or seeking to obtain,
all authorizations, consents, orders, approvals, financial information and
schedules required for any SEC filing.

  

## (d) **_Director and Officer Insurance and Indemnification_**. Buyer shall
permit NLASCO and its Subsidiaries to obtain an extended reporting
period (otherwise known as " _Tail Coverage_ ") under NLASCOs existing
directors and officers liability policy. Buyer agrees that all rights
to indemnification that the directors and officers of NLASCO and its
Subsidiaries have pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation or equivalent
governing documents (and their respective Bylaws) of NLASCO and its
Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force
and effect.

  

## (e) **_Employees._**

  

### (i) Buyer currently intends to cause NLASCO and its Subsidiaries to
continue to employ their respective employees (the " _Transferred Employees_
") at substantially the same salaries and wages and with employee benefits
which are no less favorable in the aggregate to the Transferred Employees
than those available to Buyers similarly situated employees at the Closing
Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section
is intended to affect the employment at will status of any of the
Transferred Employees absent a separate written agreement expressly intended
to accomplish the same.

  

### (ii) Buyer does not believe that any Transferred Employees will be
entitled to receive any severance or other comparable benefit as a direct or
indirect result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  If,
after the Closing Date, NLASCO or any Subsidiary terminates the employment of
any Transferred Employee, then Buyer and/or its Affiliates shall pay to such

     

   

### terminated Transferred Employee severance or other benefits comparable to
the severance or other benefits that other employees of Buyer, occupying a
position comparable to that occupied by the terminated Transferred Employee,
would receive under Buyers employment practices and policies or under
Buyers Employee Benefit Plans in place at the time that such termination
occurs.

  

### (iii) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause NLASCO and
its Subsidiaries to continue to maintain any current Employee Benefit Plans
of NLASCO or its Subsidiaries that currently provide life insurance,
disability, medical or dental benefits to the Transferred Employees for not
less than six months after the Closing Date. Buyer thereafter shall make
available to the Transferred Employees benefits comparable to other employees
of Buyer, occupying a position comparable to that occupied by the Transferred
Employee. If Buyer elects to cause the Transferred Employees to be covered by
Employee Benefit Plans maintained by Buyer rather than continue the Employee
Benefit Plans of NLASCO or its Subsidiaries, each Transferred Employee, (i)
shall be given service credit, for time employed by NLASCO or its
Subsidiaries, for the purpose of determining eligibility under the Employee
Benefit Plans maintained by Buyer; and (ii) will be given credit under the
health plan maintained by Buyer for the deductibles paid since the first day
of January of the year in which the Closing shall have occurred, under the
health plan maintained by NLASCO or its Subsidiaries. Additionally, Buyer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any preexisting
conditions restrictions under Buyers health or other welfare benefit plan to
be waived to the extent necessary to provide immediate coverage under Buyers
plan.

  

### (iv) To the extent permitted by law and the terms of the defined
contribution plan maintained by Buyer (the " _Buyer 401(k) Plan_ "), Buyer
shall permit (but not require) the Transferred Employees who are participants
in the NLASCO 401(k) Plan to elect to roll over any assets distribution from
such plan upon its termination directly to the Buyer 401(k) Plan. Buyer shall
permit the Transferred Employees to participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan (or
a defined contribution plan of an Affiliate of Buyer).

  

### (v) Buyer shall cause NLASCO or any Subsidiary to pay all salaries and
other compensation (including, but not limited to, bonuses, retirement
payments, vacation pay or sick pay) payable after the Closing Date.
NLASCO, Subsidiaries or Sellers shall not be responsible for any vacation
pay, sick pay, bonuses or comparable payments that may have accrued but shall
not have been payable prior to the Closing Date or any claims by a
Transferred Employee arising under an Employee Benefit Plan, whether made
before, on or after the Closing Date.

  

## (f) **_Cooperation_**. Sellers shall cooperate with Buyer upon request to
obtain the post-Closing Governmental Approval from the Company
Licensing Section of the Texas Department of Insurance in respect of the
substitution of underwriters of NLIC and of officers and directors of
NLASCONL directed by Buyer and effective on the Closing Date.

  

## (g) **_Confidentiality_**. From and after the Closing, Sellers and
their Affiliates shall cause their respective representatives to maintain
in confidence, and not use to the detriment of Buyer or its Affiliates
(including for the purposes of competing with Buyer or its Affiliates), any
written, oral or other information relating to or obtained from Buyer or its
Affiliates), except that the foregoing requirements of this **Section 6(g)**
shall not apply to the extent that (A) any such information is or becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by any
of Sellers, their respective Affiliates or any of their respective
representatives, (B) any such information is required

     

   

## by applicable law, governmental order or a Governmental Authority to be
disclosed; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall provide Buyer written
notice prior to such disclosure, or (C) any such information was or becomes
available to such Party on a non-confidential basis and from a source (other
than a Party to this Agreement or any Affiliate or representative of such
Party) that is not bound by a confidentiality agreement. Each of Sellers
shall instruct its Affiliates and representatives having access to
such information of such obligation of confidentiality.

# Section 8. **_Remedies for Breaches of This Agreement_**.

  

## (a) **_Survival of Representations and Warranties_**. All of
the representations and warranties of Sellers and NLASCO contained in
**Section 4** above, the Disclosure Letter, any supplements thereto and any
certificate or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive
the Closing hereunder and continue in full force and effect until the
18-month anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , any
representation or warranty with respect to Taxes shall survive until the date
on which the relevant statute of limitation expires for the assessment
of Taxes; _provided_ _further_ , that all of the representations and
warranties of Sellers contained in **Section 3(a)** above (excluding
**Section 3(a)(iii)(B), (C) and (D)** ) and in **Section 4(a)(i)** and
**(iii), (b), (c)(i), (d), (g), (n), (v)(i)(B), (v)(i)(D), (v)(i)(F),
(v)(i)(G), (v)(i)(J), (v)(ii), (v)(iii), (v)(vi) **and **(w)** shall survive

to any applicable statutes of limitations). All of the representations and
warranties of ARC and Buyer contained in **Section 3(b)** above, the
Disclosure Letter and any certificate or agreement delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Closing hereunder and continue in full force and
effect until the 18-month anniversary of the Closing Date; provided, however,
that the representations and warranties in Section 3(b)(i), 3(b)(iii)(A) and

forever thereafter (subject to applicable statutes of limitations). The right
to indemnification and all other remedies based on any representation,

to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time,
whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
date the Closing occurs, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or
compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.
The waiver of any condition to the obligation of any Party hereto to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, where such condition is
based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the
performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, shall not
affect the right to indemnification or other remedy based on such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

  

## (b) **_Indemnification Provisions for Buyer_**  ** _s Benefit_**.

  

### (i) Provided that Buyer makes a written claim for indemnification against
any Seller pursuant to **Section 10(i)** below within the survival period (if
there is an applicable survival period pursuant to **Section 8(a)**  above),
from and after the Closing, each Seller shall jointly and severally indemnify
the Buyer Indemnitees from and against any Adverse Consequences the Buyer
Indemnitees shall suffer caused by or arising out of:

  

#### (A) any inaccuracy in or breach or alleged breach of any representation
or warranty of Sellers set forth in this Agreement, the Disclosure Letter,
and any certificate or agreement delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (provided, that for purposes of calculating
the amount of any Adverse Consequences the Parties shall not give effect to
any materiality qualification or any similar qualification contained or
incorporated directly or indirectly in such representation or warranty, and
without giving effect to any update to the Disclosure Letter); _provided,
however_ , that Sellers shall not have any obligation to indemnify the

     

   

#### Buyer Indemnitees from and against any Adverse Consequences under this
**Section 8(b)(i)(A)** to the extent the Adverse Consequences caused by or
arising from the inaccuracy, breach or alleged breach (or series of related
events or circumstances) do not equal or exceed $20,000 (such Adverse
Consequences that exceed $20,000 being " _Recoverable Adverse Consequences_
"), _provided further_ , that Sellers shall not have any obligation to
indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee from and against Recoverable Adverse
Consequences until such Recoverable Adverse Consequences exceed, in
the aggregate, $3,000,000, after which point Sellers will be obligated only
to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and against further such
Recoverable Adverse Consequences; _provided further_ , that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to, or in any manner limit, Sellers obligations
under this **Section 8(b)(i)(A)**  in the event of (A) Sellers intentional
misrepresentations, fraud or willful misconduct, (B) any breach of **Section
3(a)** , or (C) any breach of **Section 4(a)(i) and (iii), (b), (c)(i), (d),
(g), (n), (v)(i)(B), (v)(i)(D), (v)(i)(F), (v)(i)(G), (v)(i)(J), (v)(ii),
(v)(iii), (v)(vi)** or **(w)** ;

  

#### (B) any breach or alleged breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or
obligation of Sellers (including without limitation the covenants set forth
in **Section 5** and **Section 6** );

  

#### (C) any violation of law, rule, regulation, Contract or fiduciary duty
in connection with the cash distribution contemplated by **Section 2(c)** ;

  

#### (D) any claim that NLASCO or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its
products or services, infringes, misappropriated or otherwise violates a
Proprietary Asset of a third party (for which purposes, Sellers will be
considered a third party); or

  

#### (E) any Legal Proceeding instituted by a third party as of the date of
this Agreement or as of the date of Closing, as applicable, that (i) is not
included in Section 4(t)(y) of the Disclosure Letter or an update thereto
delivered to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement and (ii) is not a Legal
Proceeding between NLASCO or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
any insured, on the other hand, under an insurance policy issued by NLASCO or
any of its Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course of Business, the results of
which are Actual Losses and actually are included in the post-Closing reserve
adjustment provided for in **Section 2(f)**.

  

### (ii) In the event NLASCO or any of its Subsidiaries suffers, incurs or
otherwise becomes subject to any Adverse Consequences as a result of or in
connection with any inaccuracy in or breach or alleged breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any
of the rights of NLASCO or any of its Subsidiaries as a Buyer Indemnitee)
Buyer shall also be deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of
NLASCO, to have incurred Adverse Consequences as a result of and in
connection with such inaccuracy or breach; _provided that_ Buyer and NLASCO or
any of its Subsidiaries shall only be entitled to one recovery for such
breach or inaccuracy of a representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.

  

### (iii) Sellers shall have no liability for indemnity under
**Section 8(b)(i)(A)** to the extent the amounts paid by Sellers for
the Recoverable Adverse Consequences suffered by the Buyer Indemnitees exceed
a $23,500,000 aggregate ceiling, _provided_   _that_ such ceiling shall not
apply to any claim by any Buyer Indemnitee resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, in the nature of, or caused by (A) intentional
misrepresentations, fraud or willful misconduct by Sellers, (B) any breach

     

   

### of **Section 3(a)** , or (C) any breach of **Section 4(a)(i) and (iii),
(b), (c)(i), (d), (g), (n), (v)(i)(B), (v)(i)(D), (v)(i)(F), (v)(i)(G),
(v)(i)(J), (v)(ii), (v)(iii), (v)(vi)** or **(w)**.

  

## (c) **_Indemnification Provisions for Sellers_**  ** _ Benefit_**. In
the event ARC or Buyer breaches or is alleged to breach any of its
representations, warranties, and covenants contained herein, and provided
that any Seller makes a written claim for indemnification against ARC or
Buyer pursuant to **Section 10(i)** below within the survival period (if
there is an applicable survival period pursuant to **Section 8(a)** above),
from and after the Closing, ARC and Buyer shall indemnify Seller Indemnitees
from and against any Adverse Consequences any Seller Indemnitee shall suffer
caused by the breach; _provided_ _that_  neither ARC nor Buyer shall have any
liability for indemnity until the Adverse Consequences Seller Indemnitees
have suffered by reason of all such breaches of representations and
warranties exceed a $3,000,000 aggregate deductible, after which point ARC
and Buyer will be obligated only to indemnify Seller Indemnitees from and
against further such Adverse Consequences; provided, that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to, or in any manner limit, Buyers or ARCs
obligations under this **Section 8(c)**  in the event of (i) Buyers or ARCs
intentional misrepresentation of any provision hereof, (ii) fraud or willful
misconduct of ARC or Buyer, or (iii) any breach of **Section 3(b)(i)** ,
**3(b)(iii)(A)** or **3(b)(iv)**.

  

## (d) **_Matters Involving Third Parties_**.

  

### (i) If any third party shall notify any Party (the " _Indemnified Party_
") with respect to any matter (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") which may give rise
to a claim for indemnification against any other Party (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") under this **Section 8** , then the Indemnified
Party shall promptly (and in any event within 5 business days after receiving
notice of the Third-Party Claim) notify each Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing, _provided, however_ , that any failure on the part of an Indemnified
Party to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not limit any of the
Indemnified Parties rights to indemnification under this **Section 8**
 (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the defense of
such legal proceeding).

  

### (ii) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right at any time to assume and
thereafter conduct the defense of the Third-Party Claim with counsel of his,
her, or its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
_provided, however_ , that the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-
Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not
to be unreasonably withheld) unless the judgment or proposed settlement
involves only the payment of money damages, does not impose an injunction or
other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party, and does not involve an
admission of fault, liability, or guilt by any Indemnified Party; _provided
further,_ that the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party an
opportunity to participate in the defense of the Third-Party Claim with its
own counsel and at its own expense after the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of the Third-Party Claim.

  

### (iii) Unless and until an Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the
Third-Party Claim as provided in **Section 8(d)(ii)** above, the Indemnified
Party may defend against the Third-Party Claim in any manner he, she, or it
may reasonably deem appropriate.

     

   

### (iv) In no event will the Indemnified Party consent to the entry of any
judgment on or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party
Claim without the prior written consent of each of the Indemnifying Parties
(not to be unreasonably withheld).

  

## (e) **_Determination of Adverse Consequences_**. All indemnification
payments under this **Section 8**  shall be deemed adjustments to the
Purchase Price.

  

## (f) **_Exclusive Remedy_**. Except for fraud, willful and
deliberate misrepresentation, or willful and deliberate breach of covenant,
the Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnification
provisions in this **Section 8** shall be the exclusive monetary remedy of
the Parties with respect to NLASCO, its Subsidiaries, and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  The Parties agree and acknowledge that the
ARC Shares Payment shall not be Buyer Indemnities exclusive method of
receiving indemnification from Sellers pursuant to this **Section 8**.

  

## (g) **_Satisfaction of Sellers  Indemnity Obligations_**. Upon
final determination of Sellers obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnitee
under this **Section 8** , and of the amount of Adverse Consequences
relating thereto, Buyer may require that Sellers satisfy such obligation by
returning to Buyer, at Sellers election, a combination of ARC Shares (valued
for such purpose at the then-current market price) and/or cash, with an
aggregate value equal to the amount of such Adverse Consequences. The value
of the ARC Shares shall be based on the volume-weighted average sales price
of the ARC Shares for the ten trading days immediately preceding the date of
payment. Sellers acknowledge and agree that the terms of the Escrow Agreement
and the lock-up agreement relating to the ARC Shares shall provide for
automatic extensions of their terms to the extent claims under this **Section
8** by a Buyer Indemnitee are pending on the 18-month anniversary of the
Closing Date.

  

# Section 9. **_Termination_**.

### (i) the Parties may terminate this Agreement by mutual written consent at
any time prior to the Closing;

  

### (ii) ARC or Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to Sellers at any time prior to the Closing in the event (A) any of Sellers
has within the then previous 30 business days given Buyer any notice pursuant
to **Section 5(e)(i)** above and (B) the development that is the subject of
the notice has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect;

  

### (iii) ARC or Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to Sellers at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event any of Sellers
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Disclosure
Letter, or any certificate delivered in connection herewith, shall have been
materially inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become
materially inaccurate as of any subsequent date (as if made on such
subsequent date), or if any of Sellers covenants contained in this Agreement
shall have been breached in any material respect, _provided_ _that_ , Buyer
has notified Sellers of the breach or inaccuracy, and the breach or
inaccuracy has continued without cure for a period of 30 days after the
notice of breach or (B) if the Closing

   

53   

 

  

### shall not have occurred on or before March 31, 2007, by reason of the
failure of any condition precedent under **Section 7(a)**  hereof (except
that ARC or Buyer may not so terminate this item **(iii)(B)** if (x) the
failure results primarily from ARC or Buyer breaching any representation,
warranty, or covenant contained in this Agreement) or (y) Buyer has been
unable to obtain financing on terms acceptable to Buyer and such failure is
not due to a Material Adverse Change or Sellers failure to timely provide or
certify to the NLASCO Disclosure Information; and

  

### (iv) Sellers may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
Buyer at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event any of ARCs or
Buyers representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or any
certificate delivered in connection herewith, shall have been materially
inaccurate as of the date of this Agreement or shall have become materially
inaccurate as of any subsequent date (as if made on such subsequent date), or
if any of ARCs or Buyers covenants contained in this Agreement shall have
been breached in any material respect, _provided_ _that_ , Sellers have
notified ARC or Buyer of the breach or inaccuracy, and the breach or
inaccuracy has continued without cure for a period of 30 days after the
notice of breach or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before
March 31, 2007, by reason of the failure of any condition precedent under
**Section 7(b)** hereof (unless the failure results primarily from any Seller
breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this
Agreement) or because Buyer has not advised Sellers in writing pursuant to
Section 2(g) that Buyer is prepared to consummate the transaction
described in Section 2(a) and consummated such transaction by March 31, 2007;
_ provided_, that Buyer may rescind any termination by Sellers by reason of
the failure of the condition precedent in **Section 7(b)(viii)**  if Buyer
elects to pay $10,575,000 in cash in lieu of the ARC Shares Payment, in which
case all references to the ARC Shares Payment shall be deemed to be deleted
from this Agreement.

  

## (b) **_Effect of Termination_**. If any Party terminates this
Agreement pursuant to **Section 9(a)** above, all rights and obligations of
the Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to
any other Party; _provided, however_ , that (i) the confidentiality
provisions contained in **Section 5(g)** above shall survive termination;
(ii) no Party shall be relieved of any obligation or liability arising from
any willful and deliberate breach by such Party of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other provision of this Agreement; (iii) the Parties
shall, in all events, remain bound by and continue to be subject to the
provisions set forth in **Section 10** ; (iv) no Party shall be liable for
any consequential or punitive damages, and (v) none of Sellers, NLASCO or any
NLASCO Subsidiary shall be liable or obligated to ARC or Buyer to the extent
that the Agreement is terminated as a result of the occurrence of an event
that constitutes a Material Adverse Effect and over which Sellers, NLASCO or
NLASCOs Subsidiaries have no control, such as, but not limited to, a natural
disaster, act of terrorism, declaration of war or similar event.

  

## (c) **_Termination Upon Material Adverse Effect_**. If ARC or
Buyer terminates this Agreement as a result of an event or development that
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, ARC or Buyer
first shall give Sellers a reasonable opportunity to demonstrate that such
event or development does not constitute a Material Adverse Effect on Buyer,
NLASCO or any of their Subsidiaries.

     

   

# Section 10. **_Miscellaneous_**.
