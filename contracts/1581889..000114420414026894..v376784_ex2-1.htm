thereof shall cease to have any further rights as holders of Quartet Common
Stock. Each certificate that evidenced Quartet Common Stock immediately prior
to the Redomestication Merger (" _Quartet Common Certificate_ ") shall
entitle the holder to the applicable number of Holdco Shares into which the
Quartet Common Stock is convertible according to this Section 1.5(a)(i);
provided, however, that each Quartet Common Certificate owned by holders who
have validly elected to receive a portion of the proceeds held in Quartet's

for in Quartet's Charter Documents (as defined below).

  



  

(ii) Each right of Quartet entitling the holder to automatically
receive one-tenth (1/10) of a share of Quartet Common Stock upon
consummation of the Mergers issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (" _Quartet Rights_ ") will automatically be converted
(subject to Section 1.5(c)) into one-tenth (1/10) of a Holdco Share. Each
certificate that evidenced Quartet Rights immediately prior to the
Redomestication Merger (" _Quartet Rights Certificate_ " and together with the
Quartet Common Certificates, the " _Quartet Certificates_ ") shall entitle
the holder to the applicable number of Holdco Shares into which the Quartet
Rights are convertible according to this Section 1.5(a)(ii).

  



  

(iii) The unit purchase options of Quartet (the " _Quartet UPOs_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, entitling the
holders thereof to purchase an aggregate of 420,000 units of Quartet ("
_Quartet Units_ ") for $11.75 per Quartet Unit, each such Quartet Unit
consisting of one share of Quartet Common Stock and one Quartet Right, shall
remain outstanding immediately following the Effective Time but shall be
deemed to have been converted and to represent an option to purchase 1.1
Holdco Share (for $11.75 per share, or effectively $10.68 per share), for an
aggregate of 462,000 Holdco Shares, on the same terms existing under the
Quartet UPOs immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(iv) Each share of Quartet Common Stock and each Quartet Right held

cancelled and extinguished without any conversion or payment in respect
thereof.

  



  

(v) Certificates representing the Holdco Shares issuable pursuant to
Sections 1.5(a)(i) and 1.5(a)(ii) shall be issued to the holders of

required) in the manner provided in Section 1.8).

  



  

(vi) All of the Holdco Shares issued to the holders of Quartet Common
Stock and Quartet Rights upon consummation of the Redomestication Merger
shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the outstanding Quartet Common Stock and Quartet Rights that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Pubco of
such shares of Quartet Common Stock or Quartet Rights.

  



  

(b) _Transaction Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the following shall occur in the Transaction Merger:

  



  

(i) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Transaction Merger and
this Agreement and without any action on the part of the Company,
each Company Common Share and each Company Preferred Share issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with all
accrued but unpaid dividends on the Company Preferred Shares, will be canceled
and the rights pertaining thereto will be automatically converted (subject to
Sections 1.5(b)(ii) and 1.5(c)) into the right to receive (A) an aggregate of
28,431,372 Holdco Shares, (B) the Net Income Shares (as defined in Section
1.14) in accordance with Section 1.14, (C) the Cancellation Shares (as
defined in Section 1.15) in accordance with Section 1.15, all as allocated on
_Schedule 1.5(b)(i)_ , and (D) the Potential Cash Consideration (as defined
below), or if the Company elects to receive an amount that is less than the
Potential Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(b)(iii), (x) the Elected
Cash Consideration (as defined below) and (y) an aggregate amount of Holdco
Shares determined by dividing (1) the Potential Cash Consideration minus the
Elected Cash Consideration by (2) $10.20. Immediately following the
Transaction Merger, each certificate that evidenced Company Common Shares and
Company Preferred Shares immediately prior to the Transaction Merger ("
_Company Certificates_ ") shall entitle the holder to the applicable number of
Holdco Shares into which the Company Common Shares is convertible according
to this Section 1.5(b)(i). At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Transaction Merger and this Agreement and without any action on the part of

(ii) All of the Holdco Shares issued to the holders of Company
Common Shares and Company Preferred Shares upon consummation of the
Transaction Merger shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the Company Common Shares and Company Preferred
Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the
Surviving Corp of such Company Common Shares or Company Preferred Shares.

  



  

(iii) The holders of Company Common Shares (after giving effect to
the conversion of Company Preferred Shares described in Section
1.5(b)(i) above) shall be entitled to elect to receive up to $10,000,000 (the
" _Potential Cash Consideration_ "), which amount shall be allocated among
the holders as indicated in such election. The portion of the Potential Cash
Consideration that such holders have elected to receive (the " _Elected Cash
Consideration_ ") shall be payable on the Closing Date.

  



  

(c) _No Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a Holdco Share will be
issued by virtue of the Mergers or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
each Person who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a Holdco Share
(after aggregating all fractional Holdco Shares that otherwise would be
received by such holder) shall receive, in lieu of such fractional share, an
amount in cash without interest determined by multiplying the closing sale
price of a share of Quartet Common Stock on Nasdaq on the trading day
immediately preceding the Closing Date by the fraction of a Holdco Share to
which such holder would otherwise have been entitled.

  



  

(d) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratios_. The number of Holdco Shares
that the holders of Company Common Shares, Company Preferred Shares,
Quartet Common Stock, Quartet Rights and Quartet UPOs are entitled to receive
as a result of the Mergers shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
appropriately the effect of (i) any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Quartet Common Stock or Company Common Shares), cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the Quartet Common Stock or
Company Common Shares occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) any breach or inaccuracy of either Section 2.3 or
3.3.

  



  

1.6. _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Holdco shall appoint Continental
Stock Transfer and Trust Company (" _Continental_ "), as agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the purpose of exchanging the merger consideration for (i)
Quartet Certificates, (ii) Company Certificates and (iii) any uncertificated
shares of Quartet or the Company (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). Upon
surrender of the Quartet Certificates and Company Certificates and any
Uncertificated Shares and delivery of a duly executed letter of transmittal,
in each case to the Exchange Agent, the holders of such Quartet Certificates
and Company Certificates shall receive in exchange therefor certificates
representing the Holdco Shares (" _Holdco Certificates_ ") into which their
shares of Quartet Common Stock, Quartet Rights, Company Common Shares and
Company Preferred Shares shall be converted at the Effective Time and the
Quartet Certificates, Company Certificates and any Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Holdco shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, as necessary, the Holdco Certificates to be paid in respect
of the Quartet Certificates, Company Certificates and the Uncertificated
Shares surrendered. Until so surrendered, outstanding Quartet Certificates,
Company Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the merger
consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to Sections
1.5(a) and 1.5(b).

(b) If certificates representing Holdco Shares are to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Quartet Certificates or
Company Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will
be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Quartet Certificates or
Company Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer, accompanied by an instrument of transfer that is
reasonably satisfactory to the Company and that the persons requesting such
exchange will have paid to Holdco, or any agent designated by it, any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates
representing Holdco Shares in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Quartet Certificates or Company Certificates surrendered,
or established to the satisfaction of Holdco or any agent designated by it
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  



  

1.7. _No Distributions Until Surrender of Certificates_. No
dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of
this Agreement with respect to Holdco Shares with a record date after the
Closing Date will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Quartet
Certificates or Company Certificates with respect to the Holdco Shares to be
issued upon surrender thereof until the holders of record of such Quartet
Certificates or Company Certificates shall surrender such Quartet Certificates
or Company Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of
any such Quartet Certificates or Company Certificates with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, Holdco shall promptly deliver to the record
holders thereof, without interest, the Holdco Certificates
representing Holdco Shares issued in exchange therefor and the amount of any
such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Closing
Date theretofore paid with respect to such Holdco Shares. __

  



  

1.8. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Quartet Certificates or Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, Holdco shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Quartet Certificates or Company Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof, the certificates representing the Holdco
Shares that the shares of Quartet Common Stock, Quartet Rights, Company
Common Shares and Company Preferred Shares formerly represented by such
Quartet Certificates or Company Certificates were converted into and any
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7;
provided, however, that as a condition precedent to the issuance of such
certificates representing Holdco Shares and other distributions, the owner of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Quartet Certificates or Company Certificates
shall indemnify Holdco against any claim that may be made against Holdco or
the Surviving Pubco with respect to the Quartet Certificates or Company
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

1.9. _Tax Consequences; Required Withholding_.

  



  

(a) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Mergers will
qualify as tax-free transactions pursuant to Section 351 and/or
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
") and, by executing this Agreement, adopt a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368(a) of the
United States Income Tax Regulations.

  



  

(b) Holdco and the Surviving Pubco shall each be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code, or under any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal
requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  



  

1.10. _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Pubco or
Surviving Corp with full right, title and possession to all assets, property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Quartet and the Company,
respectively, the then current officers and directors of Quartet, Holdco and
Merger Sub and the officers and directors of the Company shall take all such
lawful and necessary action.

  



  

1.11. _Escrow_. As the sole remedy for the indemnification obligations
set forth in Article VII of this Agreement, 1,100,000 of the Holdco Shares to
be issued to the Stockholders pursuant to the Transaction Merger (the "
_Escrow Shares_ ") shall be deposited in escrow (the " _Escrow Account_ "),
which shall be allocated among the Stockholders in the same proportion
as their proportionate share of the total Company Common Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time, all in accordance with the terms and conditions
of the escrow agreement to be entered into at the Closing between Holdco, the
Representative, and Continental, as escrow agent (" _Escrow Agent_ "),
substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").
On the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Basic Indemnity Escrow
Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall release 550,000 of the original
number of Escrow Shares to the Stockholders, less any of such shares
applied in satisfaction of a claim for indemnification pursuant to Article
VII and any of such shares related to a claim that is then unresolved, in the
same proportions as originally deposited into escrow. The remaining Escrow
Shares (the " _Environmental Indemnity Shares_ ") shall be available for
indemnification only with respect to Environmental Indemnification Claims
(each as hereinafter defined). On the second anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " _Environmental Indemnity Escrow Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent
shall deliver the Environmental Indemnity Shares, less any of such shares
applied in satisfaction of an Environmental Indemnification Claim and any of
such shares related to an Environmental Indemnification Claim that is then
unresolved, to each recipient in the same proportions as initially deposited
in escrow. Any Escrow Shares held with respect to any unresolved claim for
indemnification and not applied as indemnification with respect to such claim
upon its resolution shall be delivered to such Persons promptly upon such
resolution. " _Environmental Indemnification Claim_ " means a claim for
indemnification pursuant to Article VII with respect to (y) a breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 2.17 and (z) the matters
referred in _Schedule 2.17_.

1.12. _Quartet Representative_. Quartet hereby appoints Gregory
Monahan as the representative of the holders of the Quartet Common Stock and
Quartet Rights (the " _Representative_ ") to take actions and make decisions
required or permitted to be taken or made by the Representative pursuant to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. Acceptance of Holdco Shares by a
holder of Quartet Certificates to which such holder is entitled shall be
deemed acceptance by such holder of the appointment of the Representative to
act in such holder's behalf. Should the Representative resign or be unable to
serve, a new Representative shall be selected by majority vote of those
Persons who served on the Quartet Board immediately prior to the Effective
Time. The Representative shall not be liable to recipients of Holdco Shares
for any liability, loss, damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred
without gross negligence by the Representative while acting in good faith and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
duties hereunder (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to
the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith). From
and after the Effective Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Representative shall be final, binding and conclusive and not subject to
challenge by any recipient. Surviving Pubco and Surviving Corp are
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by
Representative and any acts done by Surviving Pubco or Surviving Corp in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Representative. Surviving Pubco, the Surviving Corp and each of their
respective Affiliates shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully
protected in relying upon, the power and authority of the Representative
without independent investigation.

  



  

1.13. _Stockholder Matters_.

  



  

(a) By its execution of this Agreement, each Stockholder, in its
capacity as a stockholder of the Company, hereby approves this Agreement and
authorizes the Company and its directors and officers to take all actions

Such execution and approval shall be irrevocable by each Stockholder.

  



  

(b) Each Stockholder has all necessary power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations
hereunder and, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. With

contemplated hereby pursuant to Applicable Law and the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each Stockholder and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery thereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes the legal and
binding obligation of each Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholders
in accordance with its terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy,

creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.

Subsidiaries following the Closing Date, and excluding any non-recurring
(i.e., one-time) or extraordinary expenses of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries, such as any expenses incurred in connection with the Mergers or
expenses incurred in connection with the Holdco Plan, or Quartet expenses
incurred prior to the Closing that are included in Holdco's 2014 income
statement.

  



  

(ii) " _Net Income Shares_ " means Holdco Shares issuable pursuant
to this Section 1.14.

  



  

(f) Subject to compliance with Applicable Law, any Net Income
Shares to be issued pursuant to this Section 1.14 shall be (i) issued
automatically and without requiring approval from the Holdco Board other than
approvals granted in connection with this Agreement and the Mergers, (ii)
allocated among the Stockholders as set forth on _Schedule 1.14(f)_ , and
(iii) automatically equitably adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Holdco Shares), cash
dividends, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the Holdco Shares
occurring on or after the date such Net Income Shares are issued.

(g) Not later than 150 days after the fiscal year with respect to
which Net Income is calculated, Holdco shall deliver to the
Representative its Net Income calculation (the " _Net Income Calculation_ "),
which shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties unless the
Representative, within ten Business Days after its receipt of the Net Income
Calculation, notifies Holdco in writing that it disputes any of the amounts
set forth therein, specifying the nature of the dispute and the basis
therefore. The parties shall in good faith attempt to resolve any dispute
and, if the parties so resolve all disputes, the Net Income Calculation,
as amended to the extent necessary to reflect the resolution of the dispute,
shall be conclusive and binding on the parties. If the parties do not reach
agreement in resolving the dispute within ten Business Days after notice is
given to Holdco by the Representative, the parties shall submit the dispute
to an independent accounting firm which is mutually agreeable to the parties
(the " _Accounting Arbiter_ "). Within thirty 30 days of such submission, the
Accounting Arbiter shall determine (it being understood that in making such
determination, the Accounting Arbiter shall be functioning as an expert and
not as an arbitrator), based solely on written submissions by Holdco and the
Representative, and not by independent review, only those issues in dispute
and shall render a written report as to the resolution of the dispute and the
resulting Net Income Calculation which shall be conclusive and binding on the
parties. In resolving any disputed item, the Accounting Arbiter (x) shall be
bound by the provisions of this Section 1.14(g) and (y) may not assign a
value to any item greater than the greatest value for such items claimed by
either party or less than the smallest value for such items claimed by either
party. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbiter shall be borne
by Holdco. The Representative shall be entitled to engage a firm of
independent accountants to advise it with respect to the Net Income
Calculation, with the reasonable fees and expenses of such firm to be paid by
Holdco.

  



  

(h) Except as set forth in Section 1.14(d), Net Income Shares shall
be issued to the Persons entitled to them no later than thirty (30)
days after the Net Income Calculation becomes conclusive and binding for the
fiscal year with respect to such Net Income Shares are earned.

  



  

1.15. _Cancellation Shares_.

  



  

(a) In the event that holders of Quartet Common Stock elect to
receive a portion of the proceeds held in the Trust Fund instead of
Holdco Shares upon consummation of the Redomestication Merger as permitted by
Quartet's Charter Documents with respect to 1,449,000 or more shares of
Quartet Common Stock, the holders of Company Common Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to
receive an additional number of Holdco Shares in the Transaction Merger ("
_Cancellation Shares_ ") equal to the product of (1) 1,932,000 and (2) one
minus the quotient obtained by taking (i) the number of shares of Quartet
Common Stock that have not sought to receive a portion of the proceeds held
in Quartet's Trust Fund upon consummation of the Redomestication Merger as
permitted by Quartet's Charter Documents, _divided by_ (ii) 8,211,000, which
additional Holdco Shares shall be allocated among the holders of Company
Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
in the same proportion as their proportionate share of the total Company
Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Transaction Merger and be
payable at the Effective Time. Solely for purposes of illustration and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, if 2,000,000 of the shares of
Quartet Common Stock have elected to receive a portion of the proceeds held in
Quartet's Trust Fund upon consummation of the Redomestication Merger, the
holders of Company Common Shares would be issued an additional 129,647 Holdco
Shares in the Transaction Merger.

  



    

11 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) The Quartet shareholders listed on _Schedule 1.15(b)_ (the "
_Quartet Founding Shareholders_ ") will agree to contribute back to Holdco at
the Effective Time the same number of shares to be issued to the holders of
Company Common Shares pursuant to this Section 1.15(b) and Holdco shall hold
such shares in treasury and shall not reissue such shares prior to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Quartet agrees to (i) use its reasonable best efforts to
minimize the holders of Quartet Common Stock that seek to receive a portion
of the proceeds held in Quartet's Trust Fund instead of Holdco Shares upon
consummation of the Redomestication Merger and (ii) provide the Company with
information necessary to calculate the number of Holdco Shares to be issued
pursuant to this Section 1.15 from time-to-time and in any event as soon as
such information becomes known to Quartet or its agents or representatives.

  



  

(d) Any additional Holdco Shares to be issued to the holders of
Company Common Shares pursuant to this Section 1.15 shall be subject to the
Lock-Up Agreements (as defined below).

  



  

1.16. _Consideration Adjustment_. The parties agree to treat the
transactions contemplated by Sections 1.14 and 1.15 as adjustments to the
consideration to be issued in the Mergers for all income tax purposes.

  



  

1.17. _Sale Restriction_. Prior to the Effective Time, each holder of
Company Common Shares and Company Preferred Shares prior to the Effective
Time shall enter into a Lock-Up Agreement in the form of _Exhibit B_ (the "
_Lock-Up Agreement_ ").  Holdco's register of members and certificates
evidencing Holdco Shares issued as a result of the Transaction Merger
shall each include prominent disclosure or bear a prominent legend evidencing
the fact that such shares are subject to such Lock-Up Agreements.

case as previously disclosed to Quartet in writing, or as required by this
Agreement).

(b) Except as provided pursuant to Article I of this Agreement or
disclosed in _Schedule 2.11(b)_ hereto, neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
will (i) result in any payment (including severance, unemployment
compensation, bonus or otherwise) becoming due to any director or employee of
the Company and its Subsidiaries under any Plan or otherwise, (ii) materially
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Plan, or (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

  



  

(c) No material liability under Title IV of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") has been incurred by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that has not been satisfied in full and
no event has occurred and, to the Company's knowledge, no condition exists
that could reasonably be likely to result in the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries incurring a material liability under Title IV of ERISA. No Plan
is a defined benefit pension plan or is subject to Section 302 or Title IV of
ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. No Plan is a multiemployer plan within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or a multiple employer welfare arrangement
as defined in Section 3(40) or ERISA.

Subsidiaries are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement or other
labor union contract applicable to persons employed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries nor, to the Company's knowledge, are there any activities or
proceedings of any labor union to organize any such employees. There are no
pending grievance or similar proceedings involving the Company and its
Subsidiaries and, to the Company's knowledge, any of its employees who are
subject to a collective bargaining agreement or other labor union contract,
and there are no continuing obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries
pursuant to the resolution of any such proceeding that is no longer pending.

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.12(b)_, there are no material
written agreements between the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
employees or individual contractors that their employment or services will be
for any particular length that cannot be terminated at any time, subject to
any applicable notice period prescribed therein. To the Company's knowledge,
none of its officers or key employees currently intends to terminate his or
her employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects and, to the
Company's knowledge, each of the Company's and its Subsidiaries' employees
and individual contractors is in compliance in all material respects,
with the terms of the respective employment and service agreements between
the Company or its Subsidiaries and such individuals, except, in each case,
where noncompliance would not reasonably be likely to result in the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries incurring a material liability. Except as otherwise
disclosed in _Schedule 2.12(b)_, there are no material oral or informal

superseded) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

Exchange Act) and each fairly presents or will fairly present in all
material respects the financial position of Quartet at the respective dates
thereof and the results of its operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements were, are or
will be subject to normal adjustments which were not or are not expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Quartet taken as a whole.

  



  

(c) Quartet maintains disclosure controls and procedures that
satisfy the requirements of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that all material
information concerning Quartet is made known on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of Quartet's filings with the SEC

Contract has given any written notice of any claim of any such breach, default
or event, which, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Quartet. Each agreement, contract or
commitment to which Quartet, Holdco or Merger Sub is a party or by which it
is bound that has not expired by its terms is in full force and effect,
except where such failure to be in full force and effect is not reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Quartet.

insurance, neither Quartet, Holdco nor Merger Sub maintains any
Insurance Policies.

Quartet indebted (or committed to make loans or extend or guarantee credit) to
any of them, other than reimbursement for reasonable expenses incurred on
behalf of Quartet; and (b) to Quartet's knowledge, no officer, director or
stockholder or any member of their immediate families is, directly or
indirectly, interested in any material contract with Quartet (other than such

utilized in accordance with Section 5.21.

  



  

3.26. _Governmental Filings_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.26_,

and each of Quartet, Holdco and Merger Sub is in compliance with all of its
obligations with respect thereto. No event has occurred and is continuing
which requires or permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both would
require or permit, and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any ancillary documents will not require or permit (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both), any modification or termination of
any such Governmental Actions/Filings except such events which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect
upon Quartet.

  



  

3.27. _Representations and Warranties Complete_. Except for the

5.8. _Registration Rights_ _._ The Parties hereto agree to enter
into a registration rights agreement (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_
") in the form attached as _Exhibit C_ at the Closing pursuant to which Holdco
will agree to register for resale under the Securities Act the Holdco Shares
to be issued to the Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, including
those individuals to be appointed as officers or directors of Holdco
following the Closing pursuant to Section 5.2 hereof. __

  



  

5.9. _Treatment as a Reorganization_. None of Quartet, Holdco,
Merger Sub, the Company or the Stockholders shall take any action prior to or
following the Mergers that could reasonably be expected to cause either of the
Mergers to fail to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a)(i)(A) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

  



  

5.10. _No Quartet Securities Transactions_. Neither the Company, the
Stockholders nor any of their respective Affiliates, directly or indirectly,
shall engage in any transactions involving the securities of Quartet prior to
the time of the making of a public announcement of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to require each of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors, contractors, associates, clients, customers and representatives, to
comply with the foregoing requirement.

  



  

5.11. _No Claim Against Trust Fund_. Notwithstanding anything else in
this Agreement, the Company and the Stockholders acknowledge that they have
read Quartet's final prospectus dated October 28, 2013 (" _Final Prospectus_
") and understand that Quartet has committed to seeking to have any business
with which it enters into a business combination execute a waiver of its
rights, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust
Fund. The Company and the Stockholders further acknowledge that, if Quartet
does not consummate a business combination by May 1, 2015 (or November 1, 2015
if certain conditions are met), Quartet will be obligated to return to its
stockholders the amounts being held in the Trust Fund. Accordingly, the
Company, for itself and its subsidiaries, affiliated entities, directors,
officers, employees, shareholders, stockholders, representatives, advisors
and all other associates and Affiliates, and the Stockholders, for themselves
(collectively, the " _Company and Stockholder Releasors_ "), hereby waive all
rights, title, interest or claim of any kind against any monies in the
Trust Fund for any monies that may be owed to the Company and Stockholder
Releasors by Quartet for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to
a breach of this Agreement by Quartet or any negotiations, agreements or
understandings with Quartet (whether in the past, present or future), and the
Company and Stockholder Releasors will not seek recourse against the Trust
Fund at any time for any reason whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to any of Sections 8.1 (b)
(but only if the transactions contemplated hereby have failed to close by
September 30, 2014 because of Quartet's breach of an obligation herein),
8.1(d), 8.1(g)(i) or 8.1(g)(ii) (but only if the transactions contemplated
hereby have failed to close within 45 days after the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus being cleared by the SEC because of Quartet's breach of
an obligation herein), and Quartet completes a business combination with
another company, neither the Company nor any Stockholder Releasor shall be
prohibited from filing and pursuing a claim for damages in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein following consummation
by Quartet of an alternative business combination, in each case against
Quartet or any other entity that is party to such alternative business
combination or any Affiliate thereof. Furthermore, Quartet shall not execute
any definitive agreement related to such business combination that (i)
attempts to prevent the Company or any Stockholder Releasor from so filing or
pursuing any such claim, or (ii) permits the entity that survives such
combination to not assume Quartet's obligation for damages in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein. This paragraph will
survive the termination of this Agreement for any reason.

written notice of any event, development or condition that (a) would cause any

or which may affect its ability to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) had it existed or been known on the date hereof would
have been required to be disclosed under this Agreement, (c) gives such party

existing or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedules. The obligations of the
parties to amend or supplement the Disclosure Schedules being delivered
herewith shall terminate on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any such
amendment or supplementation, for purposes of Sections 6.2(a), 6.3(a),
7.1(a)(i), 8.1(d) and 8.1(e), the representations and warranties of the
parties shall be made with reference to the Disclosure Schedules as they exist

Transaction Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
with any Person regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with

Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, or

agreement in principle requiring the Company or Quartet to abandon, terminate

proposal that may reasonably be expected to result in an Alternative
Transaction Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all
confidential information previously furnished with respect to an Alternative
Transaction Proposal and immediately terminate all physical and electronic

representatives from directly or indirectly soliciting or initiating, or
knowingly encouraging, inducing or facilitating, proposals for transactions
not involving Quartet.

Applicable Law (and Holdco and the Surviving Pubco shall also advance expenses
as incurred to the extent Quartet is obligated to advance such expenses as of

judgments, fines, settlements, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,

the intended beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the
current Charter Documents of Quartet.

liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance to the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits

actions contemplated hereby). If Quartet, Holdco and the Surviving Pubco for
any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective

shall, and the Company shall cause the Surviving Pubco to, purchase
comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year period with benefits and levels of
coverage at least as favorable as provided in Quartet's existing policies as

the Surviving Pubco be required to expend for such policies premium amounts in
excess of 250% of the premiums currently paid by Quartet for such insurance;

exceed such amount, the Surviving Pubco shall obtain a policy with the

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not

shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Holdco or the Surviving
Pubco assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.16.

  



  

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.16 are intended to be for the

Company at the date thereof and the results of its operations for the period
indicated, except that such statements need not contain notes.

been terminated; and (iii) no Insider shall own any direct equity interests in
any Subsidiary of the Company.

7.1. _Indemnification of Surviving Pubco by the Stockholders_.

  



  

(a) Effective at and after the Closing, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article VII (including without limitation the
limitations set forth in Section 7.4), the Surviving Pubco and its
representatives, successors and permitted assigns (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be indemnified, defended and held harmless by
the Stockholders, but only to the extent of the Escrow Shares, from and
against all Losses asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred
by any Indemnified Party by reason of, arising out of or resulting from:

  



  

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of
the Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement, including any
Schedule or ancillary agreement hereto, or contained in any certificate
delivered by the Company to Quartet pursuant to this Agreement with respect
hereto or thereto in connection with the Closing; and

  



  

(ii) the non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement of
the Company contained in this Agreement;

  



  

(b) As used in this Article VII, the term " _Losses_ " shall include
on a dollar for dollar basis all losses, liabilities, damages, judgments,
awards, orders, penalties, settlements, costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, interest, penalties, court costs and reasonable legal fees and
expenses) including those arising from any demands, claims, suits, actions,
costs of investigation, notices of violation or noncompliance, causes of
action, proceedings and assessments whether or not made by third parties or
whether or not ultimately determined to be valid; provided that in no event
will Losses include any indirect, remote, exemplary, consequential, punitive
or multiple-based losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, orders,
penalties, settlements, costs or expenses. Solely for the purpose of
determining the amount of any Losses (and not for determining any breach) for
which the Indemnified Parties may be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Article VII, any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that
is qualified by a term or terms such as "material," "materially," or
"Material Adverse Effect" shall be deemed made or given without such
qualification and without giving effect to such words.

  



  

7.2. _Indemnification of Third Party Claims_. The indemnification
obligations and liabilities under this _Article VII_ with respect to
actions, proceedings, lawsuits, investigations, demands or other claims
brought against a party under an obligation to indemnify pursuant to Sections
7.1 other than the Indemnified Parties (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions:

  



    

59 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(a) _Notice of Claim_. The Indemnified Parties will give the party
allegedly required to provide indemnification protection under this Article
VII (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") prompt written notice after receiving
written notice of any Third Party Claim or discovering the liability,
obligation or facts giving rise to such Third Party Claim (a " _Notice of
Claim_ ") which Notice of Third Party Claim shall set forth (i) a brief
description of the nature of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the
underlying representation, warranty or covenant alleged to have been breached
and the facts then known on which such alleged breach is based, (iii) the
total amount of the actual out-of-pocket Loss or the anticipated potential
Loss (including any costs or expenses which have been or may be reasonably
incurred in connection therewith), and (iv) whether such Loss may be covered
(in whole or in part) under any insurance and the estimated amount of such
Loss which may be covered under such insurance, and the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of Third Party Claim at
its expense.

  



  

(b) _Defense_. The Indemnifying Parties shall have the right, at
their option (subject to the limitations set forth in subsection 7.2(c)
below) and at their own expense, by written notice to the Indemnified
Parties, to assume the entire control of, subject to the right of the
Indemnified Parties to participate (at their expense and with counsel of their
choice) in, the defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim as
to which such Notice of Claim has been given, and shall be entitled to appoint
a recognized and reputable counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with
such defense; provided that an Indemnifying Party's assumption of the
defense of a Third Party Claim will not, vis-a-vis the Indemnified Parties,
constitute acceptance of liability to the Indemnified Parties under this
Article VII. If the Indemnifying Parties elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim:

  



  

(i) the Indemnifying Parties shall diligently and in good faith
defend such Third Party Claim and shall keep the Indemnified Parties
reasonably informed of the status of such defense; provided, however, that in
the case of any settlement providing for remedies which are not merely
incidental to a primary damage claim or claims for monetary damages, the
Indemnified Parties shall have the right to approve any settlement, which
approval will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned; and

  



  

(ii) the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate fully in all respects
with the Indemnifying Parties in any such defense, compromise or
settlement thereof, including, without limitation, the selection of counsel,
and the Indemnified Parties shall make available to the Indemnifying Parties
all pertinent information and documents under its control.

  



  

(c) _Limitations of Right to Assume Defense_. The Indemnifying
Parties shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified
Parties if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with
any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii)
the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the
Indemnifying Parties which is not merely incidental to a primary damage
claim or claims for monetary damages; or (iii) there is a reasonable
probability that a Third Party Claim could result in a Material Adverse
Effect of Holdco.

  



    

60 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(d) _Other Limitations_. Failure to give prompt Notice of Claim or to
provide copies of relevant available documents or to furnish relevant
available data shall not constitute a defense (in whole or in part) to any
Third Party Claim by the Indemnified Parties against the Indemnifying Parties
and shall not affect the Indemnifying Parties' duties or obligations under
this Article VII, except to the extent (and only to the extent that) such
failure shall have (i) adversely affected the ability of the
Indemnifying Parties to defend against or reduce their liability or (ii)
caused or increased such liability or otherwise caused the Losses for which
the Indemnifying Parties are obligated to be greater than such Losses would
have been had the Indemnified Parties given the Indemnifying Parties prompt
notice hereunder. So long as the Indemnifying Parties are defending any such
action actively and in good faith, the Indemnified Parties shall not settle
such action. The Indemnified Parties shall make available to the
Indemnifying Parties all relevant records and other relevant materials
required by them and in the possession or under the control of the
Indemnified Parties, for the use of the Indemnifying Parties and their
representatives in defending any such action, and shall in other
respects give reasonable cooperation in such defense.

  



  

(e) _Failure to Defend_. If the Indemnifying Parties, promptly after
receiving a Notice of Claim, fail to defend such Third Party Claim in good
faith, the Indemnified Parties, at its own cost and expense, will (upon
further written notice) have the right to undertake the defense, compromise
or settlement of such Third Party Claim as it may determine in its reasonable
discretion, provided that the Indemnifying Parties shall have the right to
approve any settlement, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(f) _Indemnified Parties ' Rights_. Anything in this Section 7.2 to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Parties shall not, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Parties (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle or compromise any
action or consent to the entry of any judgment which does not include a full
and unconditional release from all liability and obligation in respect of
such action without any payment by the Indemnified Parties.

  



  

(g) _Indemnifying Parties Consent_. Unless the Indemnifying Parties
have consented to a settlement of a Third Party Claim, the amount of
the settlement shall not be a binding determination of the amount of the Loss
and such amount shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement.

7.3. _Insurance Effect_. To the extent that any Losses that are
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article VII are covered by
insurance paid for by the Surviving Pubco or the Surviving Corp prior to or
after the Closing, the Surviving Pubco and the Surviving Corp shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery under such
insurance; provided that the Indemnified Parties shall nevertheless be
entitled to bring a claim for indemnification under this Article VII in
respect of such Losses and the time limitations set forth in Section 7.4
hereof for bringing a claim of indemnification under this Agreement shall be
tolled during the pendency of such insurance claim. The existence of a claim
by the Indemnified Parties for monies from an insurer or against a third
party in respect of any Loss shall not, however, delay any payment pursuant to
the indemnification provisions contained herein and otherwise determined to
be due and owing by the Indemnifying Parties. If the Surviving Pubco or the
Surviving Corp has received the payment required by this Agreement from the
Indemnifying Parties in respect of any Loss and later receives proceeds from
insurance or other amounts in respect of such Loss, then it shall hold such
proceeds or other amounts in trust for the benefit of the Indemnifying
Parties and shall pay to the Indemnifying Parties, as promptly as practicable
after receipt, a sum equal to the amount of such proceeds or other amount
received, up to the aggregate amount of any payments received from
the Indemnifying Parties pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Loss.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, it is the intention
of the parties that no insurer or any other third party shall be (i) entitled
to a benefit it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the
foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii) relieved of the responsibility
to pay any claims for which it is obligated.

  



  

7.4. _Limitations on Indemnification_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Article VII or elsewhere in this Agreement, the
following terms will apply to any claim arising out of this Agreement or
related to the transactions contemplated hereby:

  



  

(a) _Survival: Time Limitation_. The representations and warranties
of the Parties under this Agreement will survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement until the first anniversary of the Closing Date, at which
time such representations and warranties will expire (the " _Basic Survival
Period_ ") except that the right of the Indemnified Parties to bring (i)
Environmental Indemnity Claims shall survive the Closing for the period that
ends on the Environmental Indemnity Escrow Termination Date (the "
_Environmental Indemnity Survival Period_ "), (ii) Claims for the breach of
the representations and warranties in Sections 2.1(a) and (b), 2.3, 2.4 and
1.13(c)(iv) shall survive without limitation as to time, and (iii) Claims for
the breach of the representations and warranties in Sections 3.1, 3.3, and
3.4 shall survive without limitation as to time. The covenants and agreements
of the parties hereto contained in this Agreement, any ancillary agreement
hereto or in any certificate or other writing delivered pursuant hereto or
thereto or in connection herewith shall survive the Closing indefinitely or
for the shorter period explicitly specified therein, except that for such
covenants and agreements that survive for such shorter period,
breaches thereof shall survive indefinitely or until the latest date
permitted by law.

  



  

(b) Any indemnification claim made by the Indemnified Parties prior to
the termination of the Basic Survival Period or the Environmental Indemnity
Survival Period (each a " _Survival Period_ "), as the case may be, shall be
preserved despite the subsequent termination of such Survival Period and any
claim set forth in a Notice of Claim sent prior to the expiration of such
Survival Period shall survive until final resolution thereof. Except as set
forth in the immediately preceding sentence, no claim for
indemnification under this Article VII shall be brought after the end of the
Survival Period or the Environmental Indemnity Survival Period, as the case
may be.

  



    

62 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) _Deductible_. No amount shall be payable under Article VII
unless and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise
payable exceeds $2,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), in which event the amount
payable shall be only the Losses that are indemnifiable pursuant to Section
7.1 in excess of the amount of the Deductible (including, for avoidance of
doubt and subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VII, all
Losses that are indemnifiable pursuant to Section 7.1 from time to time after
the Deductible has been exceeded). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Deductible shall not apply to Losses that arise out of (i) a breach of
the representations and warranties in Section 1.13(c)(iv) or Section 2.3, or
(ii) an Environmental Indemnification Claim, each of which shall be
indemnifiable as to all Losses that so arise from the first dollar thereof.

  



  

(d) _Aggregate Amount Limitations_. The aggregate liability for
Losses pursuant to Section 7.1 shall not in any event exceed the
Escrow Shares in the case of Basic Indemnity Claims or the Environmental
Indemnity Shares in the case of Environmental Indemnity Claims, and Surviving
Pubco shall have no claim against the Shareholders other than for any of such
Escrow Shares (and any dividends declared and actually paid with respect to
the Escrow Shares).

  



  

(e) _No Double Recovery_. In the event that any Losses for which
indemnification is provided under this Article VII are recoverable under more
than one provision of this Agreement, the Indemnified Parties will only be
permitted to recover with respect to any particular Losses suffered by it one
time as it is the parties' intention that once any particular Losses have been
recovered by the Indemnified Parties under one provision, such Losses no
longer exist and, therefore, recovery by the Indemnified Parties for such
same Losses under another provision would constitute an unintended and
prohibited "double" recovery.

  



  

(f) _Miscellaneous Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or otherwise, the Indemnified
Parties will not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.1 for
any Loss underlying such indemnification claim to the extent that: (i) the
Indemnified Parties could have, with commercially reasonable efforts,
mitigated or prevented such Loss (or any part thereof); (ii) such Loss (or
any part thereof) results from or is increased by the action or inaction of
any Indemnified Parties or any Affiliate thereof; or (iii) such Loss (or any
part thereof) arises, or is increased, as a result of a change after the
Closing in any accounting principle, method or policy.

7.5. _EXCLUSIVE REMEDY_. HOLDCO (WHICH SHALL SURVIVE THE
REDOMESTICATION MERGER TO BECOME SURVIVING PUBCO), ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND THE
OTHER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, FROM AND
AFTER THE CLOSING, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES
WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS FOR LOSSES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE PURSUANT AND SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE
INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE VII. ACCORDINGLY, EACH OF
THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT EXPRESSLY WAIVES AND RELEASES ANY REMEDY,
LIABILITY AND ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE PURSUANT TO LAW OR EQUITY OTHER THAN
THE REMEDIES EXPRESSLY PROVIDED UNDER THIS ARTICLE VII. FURTHERMORE, EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT COVENANTS NOT TO SUE OR OTHERWISE THREATEN ANY CLAIM
THAT INCLUDES ANY REMEDY WAIVED BY THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, AND SUCH PARTIES
AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW TO BE EFFECTIVE, THE
AGREEMENT, WAIVERS AND RELEASES CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 7.5 ARE CONSPICUOUS.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OF THE FOREGOING, NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE VII
SHALL IN ANY WAY IMPAIR, MODIFY OR OTHERWISE LIMIT THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES'
RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM, DEMAND OR SUIT AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY BASED UPON
SUCH OTHER PARTY'S ACTUAL FRAUD OR INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISREPRESENTATION
OR OMISSION, IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT A MERE BREACH OF A REPRESENTATION AND
WARRANTY, WITHOUT INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL MISREPRESENTATION OR OMISSION, DOES
NOT CONSTITUTE FRAUD.

  



  

7.6. _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. Amounts paid for
indemnification under Article VII shall be deemed to be an adjustment to the
value of the Holdco Shares issued by Holdco as a result of the Mergers, except
as otherwise required by Law.

  



  

7.7. _Representative Capacities; Application of Escrow Shares_. The
parties acknowledge that the Representative's obligations under this Article
VII are solely as a representative of the Surviving Corp in the manner set
forth in the Escrow Agreement with respect to the obligations to indemnify
the Surviving Corp under this Article VII and that the Representative shall
have no personal responsibility for any expenses incurred by him in such
capacity and that all payments to the Surviving Corp as a result of
such indemnification obligations shall be made solely from, and to the extent
of, the Escrow Shares. Out-of-pocket expenses of the Representative for
attorneys' fees and other costs shall be borne in the first instance by the
Surviving Corp, which may make a claim for reimbursement thereof against the
Escrow Shares upon the claim with respect to which such expenses are incurred
becoming an Established Claim (as defined in the Escrow Agreement). The
Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement after the Closing, may apply
all or a portion of the Escrow Shares to satisfy any claim for
indemnification pursuant to this Article VII. The value of the Escrow Shares
shall be determined in accordance with the Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent
will hold the remaining portion of the Escrow Shares until final resolution
of all claims for indemnification or disputes relating thereto.

  



  

7.8. _Tax Benefits_. The amount of any Losses for which
indemnification is provided shall be reduced by any net Tax benefit to
such Indemnified Party and its Affiliates, to the extent realized by such
party as a result of such Losses, including the present value (determined by
discounting at 8%) of the benefit arising from an increase in the Tax basis of
assets, net of any Tax costs incurred by the Indemnified Party as a result of
the receipt of the indemnification payments hereunder. In calculating the
amount of net Tax benefit, the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall be
presumed to pay Taxes at a forty percent (40%) Tax rate. The
Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with such
documentation as may be reasonably requested in order to ascertain or
confirm the amount of any net Tax benefit or net Tax cost referred to herein.

  



    

64 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

7.9. _Mitigation_. A Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonably efforts to mitigate Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by it
arising out of any matter for which it is entitled to indemnification
hereunder; provided that no Indemnified Party shall be required to (i) take
any action or refrain from taking any action that is contrary to any
applicable Contract, order or law binding on it or any Affiliate thereof or
(ii) incur any out-of-pocket expense in connection with such mitigation (other
than de minimus incidental expenses).

  



  

7.10. _NO RELIANCE_. AS MODIFIED BY THE APPLICABLE DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULES, THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY CONTAINED IN
ARTICLE II AND QUARTET, HOLDCO AND MERGER SUB IN ARTICLE III, CONSTITUTE THE
SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PARTIES TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT HERETO. EXCEPT FOR SUCH REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES, NO PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT MAKES ANY OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY NATURE. EACH PARTY CONFIRMS THAT IT IS NOT
RELYING ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OTHER THAN AS SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT AND EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS NO RELIANCE CONFIRMATION IS A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO THE OTHER PARTY'S WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND BY ANY
ANCILLARY AGREEMENT HERETO. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE II, THE
COMPANY IS NOT MAKING AND HAS NOT MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH
RESPECT TO MATERIALS FURNISHED TO QUARTET OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES DURING THE
DILIGENCE PROCESS OR OTHERWISE (INCLUDING FINANCIAL OR OPERATIONAL FORECASTS)
OR MATTERS THAT WERE DISCUSSED ORALLY OR IN WRITING ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE
HEREOF.

65 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) by either Quartet or the Company if a Governmental Entity shall
have issued an order, decree, judgment or ruling or taken any other action,

action is final and nonappealable;

  



  

(d) by the Company, upon a material breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Quartet set forth in this

not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such
breach by Quartet is curable by Quartet prior to the Closing Date, then the
Company may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) for

cannot be cured, by the Company by the Termination Date), provided Quartet
continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it
being understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement

representation or warranty shall have become untrue, provided, that if such
breach is curable by the Company prior to the Closing Date, then Quartet may
not terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) for fifteen (15) days
after delivery of written notice from Quartet to the Company of such breach
(or if the Termination Date is less than fifteen (15) days from notice by
Quartet, is not cured, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured, by Quartet
by the Termination Date), provided the Company continues to exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach (it being understood that
Quartet may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) if
it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such breach by the
Company is cured during such fifteen (15)-day period);

  



  

(f) by the Company, if, at the Special Meeting (including any

date hereof) shall exercise their rights to convert the shares of
Quartet Common Stock held by them into cash in accordance with Quartet's
Charter Documents;

  



    

66

recommendation that Quartet's stockholders vote in favor of this Agreement or
the Mergers, or fails to reaffirm such recommendation as promptly as
practicable (and in any event within five Business Days) after receipt of any

obligations under Section 5.1 (it being understood, however, that the Company
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) if the breach
of Quartet's obligations under Section 5.1 arises as a result of the
Company's failure to provide the information concerning the Company required
to be included in the Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Company's failure to provide the necessary consents and approvals for the
Registration Statement and Proxy Statement/Prospectus from its auditors within
20 Business Days after the date of this Agreement) or (ii) the Mergers have
not been consummated within 45 days after the Proxy Statement/Prospectus has

Stock converted to cash in accordance with the provisions of Quartet's Charter
Documents).

  



  

8.2. _Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_. Any termination
of this Agreement under Section 8.1 above will be effective immediately upon
(or, if the termination is pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e) and
the proviso therein is applicable, thirty (30) days after) the delivery of
written notice of the terminating party to the other parties hereto. In the
event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall be of no further force or effect and the Mergers shall be
abandoned, except for and subject to the following: (i) Sections 5.6, 5.12,
8.2 and 8.3 and Article X (General Provisions) shall survive the termination
of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from
liability for any breach of this Agreement, including a breach by a party
electing to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) caused by the
action or failure to act of such party constituting a principal cause of or
resulting in the failure of the Mergers to occur on or before the date stated
therein.

  



  

8.3. _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in

parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the

10.5. _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of
such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further

valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

  



  

10.6. _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred

any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties
hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited partner, manager,

of the foregoing, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal
or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other
applicable law, for any obligations or liabilities of the parties to this
Agreement or any ancillary agreement hereto or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or any ancillary agreement,

shall cause its Affiliate to, not file, or threaten to file, any claim, suit,
action or proceeding in violation of this Section 10.7. Quartet and the
Company will be liable for all attorneys' fees and court costs arising from a

conflicts of law thereof.

  



  

10.9. _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this

document.

  



  

10.10. _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of
its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Subject to the first sentence of this Section

the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant
hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of
such right.

  



  

10.13. _CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS_. EACH PARTY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF ANY FEDERAL OR
STATE COURT LOCATED IN THE COUNTY OF NEW YORK OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR THE
COUNTY OF WILMINGTON OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT
OR PROCEEDING ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE DOCUMENTS AND
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY, AND AGREES THAT ANY SUCH
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE BROUGHT ONLY IN SUCH COURT (AND WAIVES ANY
OBJECTION BASED ON FORUM NON CONVENIENS __ OR ANY OTHER OBJECTION TO VENUE
THEREIN); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SUCH CONSENT TO JURISDICTION IS SOLELY FOR
PURPOSES OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ANCILLARY AGREEMENT RELATED HERETO, OR ANY
TRANSACTION RELATED HERETO (INCLUDING THE MERGERS) OR THERETO. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion,

respect to this Agreement, (i) the defense of sovereign immunity, (ii) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named
courts for any reason, (iii) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise), and (iv) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law that
(A) the suit, action or proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper and (C) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be
enforced in or by such courts. Any and all process may be served in any
action, suit or proceeding arising in connection with this Agreement by
complying with the provisions of Section 10.1. Such service of process shall
have the same effect as if the party being served were a resident of the
State of New York and had been lawfully served with such process in such
jurisdiction. The parties hereby waive all claims of error by reason of such
service. Nothing herein shall affect the right of any party to service
