-viii- ACQUISITION AGREEMENT

 

THIS ACQUISITION AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as
of May 27, 2015 by and among CA, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "),
Grand Prix Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Rally Software Development Corp.,
a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). All capitalized terms that are
used in this Agreement but not defined herein shall have the respective
meanings ascribed thereto in _Annex A_.

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

WHEREAS, in order to effect the foregoing acquisition, Parent and the Company
have agreed that Merger Sub shall commence a tender offer (the " _Offer_ ")
to acquire all of the outstanding Company Shares at a price of Nineteen
Dollars and Fifty Cents ($19.50) per Company Share, net to the holder thereof
in cash, without interest (such amount, or any higher amount per
Company Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Offer Price_ "), all upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein.

 

WHEREAS, in order to complete the foregoing acquisition, following the
completion of the Offer, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company,

, that the foregoing clauses (i) - (iii) of this  _Section 1.1(e)_,

amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to refuse to make, withhold,
withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation, (B)

thereafter during which any such tender offer or exchange offer is pending),
(C) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9,
(D) fail to reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5)
Business

 



-9-  days of a written request to do so by Parent (which such request, in the
case of an Acquisition Proposal which has not been made publicly known, Parent
shall be limited to making no more than once every fifteen (15) days), or (E)
resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any of the foregoing actions (any
action described in the preceding clauses (A) Â– (E) being referred to herein
as a " _Company Board Recommendation Change_ "); _provided, however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, a "stop, look and listen" communication by the
Company Board pursuant to and in compliance with Rule 14d9-(f) of the Exchange
Act shall not be deemed to be a Company Board Recommendation Change and shall
not require compliance with the procedures set forth in this _Section
1.2(b)_. For avoidance of doubt, a termination of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to  _Section 7.1(h)_ shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change, and any Company Board Recommendation Change effected
simultaneously with such termination shall not require a separate notice
period under  _Section 1.2(b)(iii)_ below.

(iii) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 1.2(b)(ii)_, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, if (A) the Company Board has received an
unsolicited, _bona fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal and after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and outside legal
counsel, the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors shall have determined, in good
faith, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (B)
such Acquisition Proposal did not arise out of a breach of the provisions of
this _Section 1.2(b)_ or _Section 6.1_, (C) the Company Board has determined
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and after
considering in good faith any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent
pursuant to clause (E) below), that, in light of the foregoing Superior
Proposal, the Company Board is reasonably required to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under Delaware Law, (D) prior to effecting such Company
Board Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent at
least four (4) Business Days prior written notice thereof (a " _Determination
Notice_ ") (which Determination Notice shall not constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change), which Determination Notice shall attach such Superior
Proposal and set forth the identity of the Person making such Superior
Proposal and all the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
in reasonable detail, and the opportunity to meet with the Company Board and
its outside legal counsel, all with the purpose and intent of enabling Parent
and the Company to discuss in good faith a modification of the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby may
be effected and (E) Parent shall not have made, within four (4) Business Days
after receipt of the CompanyÂ’s Determination Notice of its intention to effect
a Company Board Recommendation Change, a counter-offer or proposal of a nature
such that the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
standing and its outside legal counsel) that the Acquisition Proposal no
longer constitutes a

 



-10-  Superior Proposal and after consultation with outside legal counsel the
Company Board is no longer reasonably required to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under Delaware Law. The Company shall keep confidential
any such counter-offers or proposals made by Parent to revise the terms of
this Agreement, whether pursuant to this _Section 1.2(b)_,  _Section
7.1(h)_ or otherwise, other than in the event of any amendment to this
Agreement and to the extent required to be disclosed in any SEC Reports. The
provisions of this _Section 1.2(b)(iii)_ shall also apply to any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice,
except that the references to four (4) business days shall be deemed to be two
(2) business days.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 1.2(b)(ii)_, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time in response to an Intervening Event if (A) the
Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening Event, the Company
Board is reasonably required to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change
in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
Delaware Law, (B) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation
Change, the Company Board shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at
least four (4) Business Days prior written notice thereof, which Determination
Notice shall specify in reasonable detail the facts underlying the
Company BoardÂ’s determination that an Intervening Event has occurred and the
rationale and basis for such Company Board Recommendation Change and the
opportunity to meet with the Company Board and its outside legal counsel, all
with the purpose and intent of enabling Parent and the Company to discuss in
good faith a modification of the terms and conditions of this Agreement so as
to obviate the need to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change on the
basis of such Intervening Event so that the transactions contemplated hereby
may be effected, and (C) following the expiration of such four (4)-Business
Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) and after giving good faith
consideration to any offer or proposal from Parent, that, in light of such
Intervening Event, the Company Board is reasonably required to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change in order to comply with its fiduciary
duties to the Company Stockholders under Delaware Law.

(v) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, _provided_ , _however_ , that
any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under
the Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change unless accompanied by a clear,
unqualified and unconditional reaffirmation of the Company Board
Recommendation.

Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, remains in effect and has the effect of making
the Merger illegal or prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of
the Merger.

2.3 _The Surviving Corporation_. 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 

(i) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated in its

 



-13-  entirety to read identically to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such amended
and restated Certificate of Incorporation shall become the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware Law and such Certificate
of Incorporation; _provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so
that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Rally Software
Development Corp."

 

(ii) _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall become the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, the Certificate of Incorporation of the

(b) _Directors and Officers_.

 

(i) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 

(ii) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving

2.4 _General Effects of the Merger_.

 

At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

2.5 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock_ _of the Constituent
Corporations._

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or the holders of any of the following securities, each share of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that

 



-14-  is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing
ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter
evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 

(i) _Company Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of
any of the following securities, the following shall occur: each Company Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Canceled Company Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) shall be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive cash in an
amount equal to the Offer Price, without interest thereon (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "); _provided, however_ , that the Merger Consideration shall
be automatically adjusted to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Shares), cash dividends, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to Company Shares occurring on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
all Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled, extinguished and cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share theretofore representing any Company Shares (other than
Dissenting Company Shares) shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor
upon the surrender or transfer thereof in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 2.6_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Company Shares. From and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of
the Surviving Corporation of Company Shares that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in
accordance with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the
Effective Time, and if, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

(ii) _Canceled Company Shares_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the
holders of any of the following securities, each Company Share that is owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether pursuant to the Offer or
otherwise) (" _Canceled Company Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and
extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration paid therefor.

 



-15- (iii) _Dissenting Company Shares_.

 

(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, all
Company Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by stockholders who shall have properly and validly
exercised their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of such Company
Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, "
_Dissenting Company Shares_ ") shall not be converted into, or represent the
right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section 2.5_.
Such stockholders shall be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value
of such Dissenting Company Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL, except that all Dissenting Company Shares held by
stockholders who shall have failed to perfect or who shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Company Shares
under such Section 262 of the DGCL shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into, and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time,
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon,
upon surrender of the certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such
Company Shares in the manner provided in _Section 2.6_.

 

(B) The Company shall give Parent (1) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company in
respect of Dissenting Company Shares and (2) the opportunity and right (at
ParentÂ’s election) to direct and control all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law in respect of
Dissenting Company Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or settle or offer to settle any such demands for
payment in respect of Dissenting Company Shares.

2.6 _Payment of Merger Consideration_.

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as the payment
agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

(b) _Exchange Fund_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit (or cause to be deposited) the aggregate Merger Consideration with the
Payment Agent, for payment to the Company Stockholders pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_ (such cash amount being referred to herein
as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



-16- (c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than five (5) business days thereafter), Parent and Merger Sub
shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the
" _Certificates_ ") or non-certificated Company Shares represented by book-
entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Company Shares (other than Canceled Company Shares and
Dissenting Company Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
or transfer of the Book-Entry Shares to the Payment Agent) and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
transfer of Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable
in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article II_. Upon
(i) surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, or (ii) receipt of an "agentÂ’s message" by the Payment
Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the Payment Agent
may reasonably request) in the case of a transfer of Book-Entry Shares, the
holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, and the Certificates so
surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so transferred shall forthwith be canceled.
The Payment Agent shall accept such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Payment Agent
may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of such Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.6_. Until so surrendered or transferred,
outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed from and after
the Effective Time, to evidence only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this
_Article II_.

 

(d) _Transfers of Ownership_. In the event that a transfer of ownership of
Company Shares is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if Merger Consideration is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Shares are
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company, the
Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the surrendered Certificate or transferred Book-Entry Shares are
registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company only if such
Certificate is properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for surrender
and transfer or such Book-Entry Shares are properly transferred and the Person
requesting such payment has paid to Parent (or any agent designated by Parent)
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share, or established to the satisfaction of Parent (or any
agent designated by Parent) that such transfer or other Taxes have been paid
or are otherwise not payable.

 



-17- (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this _Article II_;
_provided, however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Merger Sub, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Law. To the extent that such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and properly remitted to the appropriate
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any
amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(h) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares on the date that is twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent (or its designee) upon demand, and any Company
Stockholders who have not theretofore surrendered their Certificates or
transferred their Book-Entry Shares evidencing such Company Shares for
exchange pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.6_ shall thereafter
look for payment of the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Company
Shares evidenced by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares solely to Parent,
as general creditors thereof, for any claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions
of this _Article II_. 

2.7 _Necessary Further Action_.

 

In the event that, at any time from and after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to
all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub, the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall
take all such lawful and necessary action on behalf of the Company and Merger
Sub to accomplish the foregoing. From and after the Effective Time, the
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 



-18- ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

OF THE COMPANY

Except as (a) expressly set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by the
Company to Parent on the date of this Agreement prior to the execution hereof
(the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), which disclosure shall be deemed to
qualify or provide disclosure in response to (i) the specific section or
subsection of this _Article III_ that specifically corresponds to the section
of subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule in which any such disclosure
is set forth, and/or (ii) any other section or subsection of this _Article
III_ solely to the extent that it is readily apparent from the text of such
disclosure (without reference to the underlying documents referenced therein
and without assuming any knowledge of the matters disclosed) that such
disclosure is applicable to such other section or subsection of this _Article
III_ or (b) as disclosed in the CompanyÂ’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the
fiscal years ended January 31, 2014 (the " _2014 10-K_ ") and January 31,
2015 (the " _2015 10-K_ " and, together with the 2014 10-K, the " _10-Ks_ "),
the CompanyÂ’s proxy statements on Schedule 14A for its 2014 and 2015 annual
stockholder meetings, and any Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current
Reports on Form 8-K filed subsequent to the 2015 10-K and prior to the date of
this Agreement (other than any information in the "Risk Factors" or "Forward-
Looking Statements" sections of such Company SEC Documents or other forward-
looking statements in such Company SEC Documents), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 

3.1 _Organization and Good Standing_.

 

The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under Delaware Law. The Company has the requisite power
and authority to carry on its respective business as it is presently being
conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and assets.
The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or the
nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent the
"good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside
the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made available
to Parent true, correct and complete copies of (x) the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws or other constituent documents, as amended to date,
of the Company, and (y) the minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes, the
most recent drafts thereof) of all meetings, and any action taken by written
consent, of the Company Stockholders, the Company Board and each committee of
the Company Board, in each case occurring at any time during the five years
prior to the date of this Agreement. The Company is not in violation of
its certificate of incorporation or bylaws, except for such violations that
would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



-19- 3.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to
perform its obligations hereunder.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no additional
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger). The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the issued and outstanding Company Shares is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of Company capital stock that, absent Section
251(h) of the DGCL, would have been necessary under applicable Law and the
CompanyÂ’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws to adopt, approve or
authorize this Agreement and consummate the Merger.

(c) At a meeting duly called and held prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company Board has, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, (i) unanimously determined that this Agreement is
advisable, (ii) unanimously determined that this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, taken
together, are at a price and on terms that are fair to, and in the best
interests of the Company and the Company Stockholders, (iii) unanimously
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Offer and the Merger, and the Support Agreements, and (iv) resolved to
make the Company Board Recommendation.

(d) The Company Board has received the opinion of Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc. to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement and based upon and
subject to the assumptions, limitations and qualifications set forth therein,
the cash consideration to be received in the Offer and the Merger, taken
together as an integrated transaction, is fair, from a financial point of
view, to the holders of Company Shares (other than Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates). It is agreed and understood that such opinion
is for the benefit of the CompanyÂ’s Board of Directors and may not be relied
upon by Parent or Merger Sub. The Company shall deliver or make available to
Parent solely for informational purposes a copy of the signed opinion as soon
as possible following the date of this Agreement.

(e) Assuming that the representations of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in
_Section 4.6_ are accurate, the Company Board has taken all necessary actions
so that the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of
the DGCL and any other similar applicable Law are not applicable to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) or the Support Agreements or the transactions contemplated
thereby. No other state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation
applies to or purports to apply to the Offer, the Merger, the Support
Agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

(f) At a meeting duly called and held at which all members of the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board (the " _Compensation Committee_ ")
were

 



-20-  present, the Compensation Committee (i) duly and unanimously adopted
resolutions approving as an "employment compensation, severance or other
employee benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under
the Exchange Act, (A) each Company Stock Plan, (B) the treatment of Company
Options, Company RSUs, and Company Phantom Stock Rights in accordance with the
terms set forth in this Agreement, the applicable Company Stock Plan and any
applicable Employee Plan, (C) the terms of _Section 6.9_ and _6.10_ , and (D)
each other Employee Plan that under the terms of this Agreement is required to
be set forth in _Sections 3.17(a)(i)_ and _3.17(a)(ii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule which resolutions have not been rescinded, modified or
withdrawn in any way, and (ii) has taken all other actions necessary to
satisfy the requirements of the no-exclusive safe harbor under Rule
14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to the foregoing
arrangements. A true and complete copy of the resolutions of the Compensation
Committee reflecting any approvals and actions referred to in the
preceding sentence has been provided to Parent and Merger Sub prior to
execution of this Agreement. Each member of the Compensation Committee is an
"independent director" within the meaning of the requirements of Rule
14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act.

(g) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that
such enforceability (i) may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws affecting or relating to
creditorsÂ’ rights generally and (ii) is subject to rules of law
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies and general principles of equity.

3.3 _Required Governmental Consents_.

No consent, approval, Order or authorization of, or filing or registration
with, or notification to (any of the foregoing being a " _Consent_ "), any
Governmental Authority is required on the part of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and the Merger), except
(a) the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and such filings with
Governmental Authorities to satisfy the Laws of states in which the Company
and its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business, (b) such filings and
approvals as may be required by any federal or state securities laws,
including compliance with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act,
(c) compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and other
applicable Antitrust Laws and (d) such other Consents, the failure of which to
obtain would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. The Company has not opted out of Section 251(h) of the DGCL in the
Company Certificate or taken any other action to preclude the Merger from
being effected in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

3.4 _Conflicts_.

 

The execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this Agreement, the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) and the compliance by the Company with
any of the provisions hereof do not and

 



-21-  will not (a) violate or conflict with any provision of the certificates of
incorporation or bylaws or other constituent documents of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries, (b) subject to obtaining such Consents set forth in
_Section 3.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, violate, conflict with,
or result in the breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or result in
the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a
right of termination or acceleration under, any Contract to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets may be bound, or any Permits
held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (c) assuming compliance with
the matters referred to in _Section 3.3_, violate or conflict with any
applicable Law or Order applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or by which any of their properties or assets are bound or (d) result in the
creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and
(d) above, for such violations, conflicts, or Liens which would not be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

3.5 _Capitalization_.

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 200,000,000
Company Shares and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Company Preferred Stock. As of
the close of business on May 26, 2015 (the " _Capitalization Date_ "), (A)
25,647,582 Company Shares were issued and outstanding, (B) no shares of
Company Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, and (C) no shares of
Company Capital Stock were held by the Company as treasury shares. All
outstanding Company Shares are validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and
free of any preemptive rights. Since the close of business on the
Capitalization Date, the Company has not issued any shares of Company Capital
Stock other than pursuant to the exercise of Company Options, Company
Warrants or the settlement of Company RSUs granted under a Company Stock Plan.

(b)  _Section 3.5(b)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
listing of all equity plans of the Company. _Section 3.5(b)(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, with respect to each outstanding
Company Option and Company Warrant as of the close of business on the

been and would not reasonably expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as would not
result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the
extent applicable, each International Employee Plan has been approved by the
relevant taxation and other Governmental Authorities

 



-37-  so as to enable (i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the

employees or agents has, with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or
been a party to any non-exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is
defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which would
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a tax imposed by Section 4975 of the
Code, in each case applicable to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
Employee Plan or for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any

provide, post-termination or retiree life insurance, health or other employee
welfare benefits to any Employee for any reason, except as may be required by

or contracted (whether in oral or written form) to any Employee (either

Employee(s) or other person would be provided with life insurance, health or
other employee welfare benefits after retirement or termination of services,
except to the extent required by COBRA.

Law, neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation

benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any

to Employees, and any state or local mandatory health benefit, contribution,
and coverage requirement applicable to Employees. The Company and each ERISA

qualified beneficiaries pursuant to COBRA, the Affordable Care Act, or any
state or local Law governing health care coverage or benefits that would
result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

by thirty (30) daysÂ’ notice or less given at any time without giving rise to
any claim for damages, severance pay, or compensation (other than a statutory
redundancy payment applicable by virtue of applicable Law or compensation for
unfair dismissal applicable by virtue of Law or any equivalent remedy under
applicable local Law) that would result in any material liability to the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

(n) No promise has been made to any Non-U.S. Employee that his defined
contribution benefits under any Funded International Employee Plan will at
any point in the future equate to or not be less than any particular amount.
Furthermore, no International Employee Plan has material liabilities, that as
of the Closing Date, will not be offset in full by insurance or otherwise be
fully accounted for on a basis which complies with International Accounting
Standard 19 (IAS 19) (whether or not IAS 19 applies to the Company or, if
relevant, any of its Subsidiaries).

 

(o) Except as required by applicable Law, no condition or term under any
relevant Employee Plan exists which would prevent Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from terminating or amending any
Employee Plan or International Employee Plan at any time for any reason
without material liability to Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries (other than ordinary administration expenses or routine
claims for benefits).

3.18 _Labor Matters_.

 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract
or arrangement between or applying to, one or more employees and a trade

are no lockouts, strikes, slowdowns, concerted refusal to work overtime, work
stoppages or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threats thereof by or with
respect to any employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor have

Subsidiaries, except for amounts earned prior to the time of termination.

 

(d) All individuals who are, or were, performing consulting or other services
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries cannot reasonably be deemed to
have been misclassified by the Company or its Subsidiaries as either
"independent contractors" (or comparable status in the case of a foreign of
its Subsidiaries) or "employees" as the case may be, in a way that
would result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Similarly, all individuals who are or were classified as
employees as of the Effective Time cannot reasonably be deemed to have been
misclassified as exempt or non-exempt, as the case may be, under the Fair
Labor Standards Act or other applicable Laws in a way that would result in any
material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has taken any action with respect
to U.S. employees which would constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff"

required by the WARN Act or similar foreign, state or local applicable Law,
or incurred any liability or obligation under WARN or any similar foreign,

-41-  consulting or independent contractor contracts with each employee and
consultant providing services to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Such

to terminate his or her relationship or status as an employee or consultant of
the Company or its Subsidiaries for any reason, including because of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries have no plans or intentions, as of the date hereof, to

applicable) holds a valid leasehold estate in the Leased Real Property
described therein, free and clear of all Liens.

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, result in
any breach of or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse
of time or both would become a default) under, or materially impair the rights
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or alter the rights or obligations
of the sublessor, lessor or licensor under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of any Leases, or
otherwise adversely affect the continued use and possession of the Leased Real
Property for the conduct of business as presently conducted. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach of or default under any
Lease, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred that with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a breach or default

permitted by such confidentiality agreement). Such written requests
shall contain a notice to each Person that any information that is sent to
the Company in the future will not be treated as confidential pursuant to such
confidentiality agreement.

of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the

Sub) that is seeking to make or has made an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, definitive agreement
or similar document or Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Transaction (other than any confidentiality agreement entered into

-58- (c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_, prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may, directly or indirectly through

with the provisions of this _Section 6.1_, (A) engage or participate
in discussions or negotiations with any Person that has made (and not
withdrawn) an unsolicited, _bona fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal on or
after the date of this Agreement that did not result from any breach of
_Section 1.2(b)_ or this _Section 6.1_ and which the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized standing and outside legal counsel) is a Superior
Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B)
furnish to any Person that has made (and not withdrawn) an unsolicited, _bona
fide,_ written Acquisition Proposal on or after the date of this Agreement
that did not result from any breach of  _Section 1.2(b)_ or this _Section
6.1_ and which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized standing and outside legal
counsel) is a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal any non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to a confidentiality agreement the terms of which are no
less favorable to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (which confidentiality agreement shall not include any provisions
that would prevent or restrict the Company or the Company Representatives from
providing any information to Parent to which Parent would be entitled under
any provision of this Agreement); _provided, however_ , that in the case of
any action taken pursuant to the foregoing clauses (A) or (B), (1) the Company

information to such Person, the Company furnishes such non-public information
to Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously furnished by
the Company to Parent). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,

violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.1_ by any Company
Representative shall constitute a breach of this _Section 6.1_ by the
Company.

 

(d) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in _Section
6.1(b)_, the Company shall promptly _,_ and in all cases within twenty four
(24) hours of its receipt, advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information that would reasonably
be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction or
(iii) any inquiry with respect to, or which would reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, in each case,
including the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal
or Acquisition Transaction, request or inquiry (unless such Acquisition
Proposal is in written form, in which case the Company shall give Parent a
copy thereof), and the identity of the Person or group making any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company shall keep Parent
promptly and reasonably informed of the status, details, terms and conditions
(including all amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry. In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall
provide Parent with at least forty-eight (48) hours prior written notice of a
meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected
to consider an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, an inquiry
relating to a potential Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction, or a
request to provide nonpublic information to any Person in relation to an
Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction.

things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), including
using commercially reasonable efforts to (a) cause the conditions to the Offer

the Merger), (c) obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, approvals, Orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities,

consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the
purposes of, this Agreement. With respect to clause (b) above, (i) all fees,

conditions its grant of a consent (including by threatening to exercise a
"recapture" or other termination right) upon, or otherwise requires in
response to a notice or consent request regarding the transactions

Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer and
the Merger) as required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger

Authority that may be required by other applicable Antitrust Laws, in
each case as Parent may deem necessary and/or appropriate. Each of Parent and
the Company shall promptly, subject to an appropriate confidentiality
agreement to limit disclosure to counsel and outside consultants retained by
such counsel, and except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority
or by

 



-60-  any Law, (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such
filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that may be required in
order to effectuate such filings, and (iii) supply any additional information
that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the
competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and that
Parent reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate. Parent shall be solely
responsible for all fees and expenses incurred in connection with filings made
in connection with this _Section 6.3(a)_. Each party hereto shall promptly
inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any
communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger). If any party hereto or Affiliate thereof receives a request for
additional information or documentary material from any such Governmental
Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Offer and the Merger), then such party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, an appropriate
response in compliance with such request. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
commit or agree (or permit their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to
commit or agree) with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust
Laws, without the prior written consent of the other (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none

the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (i) become
subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any action
with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,

separate or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, (B) conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise

respective Subsidiaries in any manner, or (C) impose any restriction,

business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any
of their respective Subsidiaries; _provided_ that, if requested by Parent,
the Company will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or
otherwise take any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or order so long as such requirement,
condition, limitation, understanding, agreement or order is only binding on
the Company in the event the Closing occurs or (ii) file or defend any lawsuit
or Legal Proceeding, appeal any judgment or Order or contest any injunction
issued in a Legal Proceeding initiated by a Governmental Authority.

6.4 _Anti-Takeover Statutes_.

 

Without limiting the generality of the provisions of _Sections 6.2_ and _6.3_
, in the event that any state anti-takeover or other similar statute or
regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), the Company, at the direction of the Company Board, shall use
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) may be consummated as promptly
as practicable on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the

this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination

representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, upon
reasonable notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the
Company to enable Parent to obtain all information concerning the Leased Real
Property, the Assets and the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including the status of product development efforts, properties, results of
operations and personnel of the Company, as Parent may reasonably request;
_provided, however,_ that any such access shall be conducted at ParentÂ’s
expense, at a reasonable time, under the supervision of appropriate personnel
of the Surviving Corporation and in such a manner as not to unreasonably
interfere with the normal operation of the business of the Surviving
Corporation. Nothing herein shall require the Surviving Corporation to
disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would, in its reasonable
discretion (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege (so
long as the Surviving Corporation has reasonably cooperated with Parent
to permit such inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis that
does not waive such privilege with respect thereto) or (ii) contravene any
applicable legal requirement; _provided, however,_ that information shall be
disclosed subject to execution of a joint defense agreement in customary
form, and disclosure may be limited to external counsel for Parent, to the
extent doing so may be reasonably required for the purpose of complying with
applicable Antitrust Laws; and  _provided, further,_ that the parties will
cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to find a way to allow diligence of
such information in a manner that would not cause the results in clauses (i)
or (ii); and _provided, further,_  that no information or knowledge obtained
by Parent in any investigation conducted pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ shall
affect or be deemed to modify or waive (i) any right or claim of the Parent or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to any representation or warranty of
the Company or a Subsidiary set forth herein, or (ii) any condition to the
obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, or the remedies
available to the parties hereunder; and _provided further_ , that the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to any information
provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.5_.

Agreement, (ii) upon receiving any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by

has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement;  _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub
set forth herein or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, or the remedies available to the parties hereunder and _provided
further_ , that the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement
shall apply to any information provided to the Company pursuant to this
_Section 6.6(c)_.

6.7 _Transaction-Related Litigation_.

 

(a) The Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in writing of any
litigation commenced after the date hereof against the Company or any of its
directors by any Company Stockholders (on their own behalf or on behalf of the
Company) relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Offer and the Merger) and shall keep Parent reasonably and
regularly informed regarding any such litigation.

 



-63- (b) The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to consult with the Company
regarding the defense or settlement of any litigation filed against the
Company or any of its directors or officers in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Offer and the
Merger), shall consider ParentÂ’s views with respect to such litigation and
shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of
Parent.

6.8 _Treatment of Company Warrants and Company Equity Awards_.

(a) _Company Warrants_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall satisfy
all notification or amendment requirements under the terms of any Company
Warrants and each Company Warrant that is listed on _Section 6.8(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and that is issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, unless otherwise elected by the holder of
any such Company Warrant, shall be caused to be exercised immediately prior to
the Acceptance Time. All Company Shares issued to holders of Company Warrants
pursuant to an exercise shall be made through Book-Entry Shares.

(b) _Company Options_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Vested Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and converted into the right to receive an amount, less
applicable withholdings, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
number of shares of Common Stock covered by such Vested Option immediately
prior to the Closing by (y) the excess (if any) of the Offer Price over the
per share exercise price under such Vested Option (" _Option Consideration_
").

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Unvested Option shall be cancelled as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to
receive an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number
of shares of Common Stock covered by such Unvested Option immediately prior to
the Closing by (y) the excess (if any) of the Offer Price over the per share
exercise price under such Unvested Option (" _Unvested Option Cash_ "). The
Unvested Option Cash will be subject to applicable withholdings and continue
to have, and will, except as otherwise provided in a written employment
agreement between the holder of such Unvested Option and Parent, be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the Company Stock Plan under
which it was granted and the agreements evidencing the grant thereof
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including without limitation
provisions with respect to vesting, provided that payments of Unvested Option
Cash will be made on the last business day of the ParentÂ’s fiscal quarter in
which the Unvested Options to which the Unvested Option Cash is attributable
would have vested. For the avoidance of any doubt, if a holder of an Unvested
Option fails to vest in any portion of his or her Unvested Option Cash
(including, but not limited to, due 

 



-64-  to a failure to meet the applicable vesting requirements set forth in his or
her agreement evidencing the grant of such Unvested Option), such amounts
shall be retained by Parent and forfeited by such holder for no
consideration. Each payment of Unvested Option Cash hereunder is intended to
be a separate "payment" for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and comply
with or be exempt from Section 409A of the Code, and any ambiguities
hereunder will be resolved in a manner to maintain such exemption from or
compliance with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(iii) Each Vested Option and each Unvested Option with a per share exercise
price equal to or in excess of the Offer Price shall terminate for no
consideration at the Effective Time.

(c) _Company RSUs_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each Vested RSU that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and converted into the right an amount, less applicable
withholdings, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of
shares of Common Stock covered by such Vested RSU immediately prior to the
Closing by (y) the Offer Price (" _RSU Consideration_ ").

(ii) At the Effective Time, each Unvested RSU shall be cancelled as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right to
receive the RSU Consideration that would be payable for such Unvested RSU if
it were a Vested RSU as of the Closing (" _Unvested RSU Cash_ "). Unvested
RSU Cash will be subject to applicable withholdings and continue to have, and
will, except as otherwise provided in a written employment agreement between
the holder of such Unvested RSU and Parent, be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the CompanyÂ’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended,
and the agreements evidencing the grant thereof immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including without limitation provisions with respect to
vesting, provided that payments of Unvested RSU Cash will be made on the last
business day of the ParentÂ’s fiscal quarter in which the Unvested RSUs to
which the Unvested RSU Cash is attributable would have vested. For the
avoidance of any doubt, if a holder of an Unvested RSU fails to vest in any
portion of his or her Unvested RSU Cash (including, but not limited to, due to
a failure to meet the applicable vesting requirements set forth in his or her
agreement evidencing the grant of such Unvested RSU), such amounts shall be
retained by Parent and forfeited by such holder for no consideration. Each
payment of Unvested RSU Cash hereunder is intended to be a separate "payment"
for purposes of Section 409A of the Code and comply with or be exempt from
Section 409A of the Code, and any ambiguities hereunder will be resolved in a
manner to maintain such exemption from or compliance with Section 409A of the
Code.

 

(d) _Phantom Stock Rights_

 



-65- (i) Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary in the Phantom Stock Plan
and the agreements evidencing the grant thereof, the following provisions
will apply to Phantom Stock Rights in the event of a Change in Control (as
that term is defined in the Phantom Stock Plan) which, for the avoidance of
doubt, includes the transaction contemplated in this Agreement.

(ii) At the Effective Time, each holder of a Vested Phantom Stock Right
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled
to receive an amount, less applicable withholdings, equal to the excess (if
any) of the Offer Price over the Initial Value (" _Phantom Stock
Right Consideration_ ").

(iii) At the Effective Time, each holder of an Unvested Phantom Stock Right
that is unvested immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to
receive an amount, less applicable withholdings, equal to the excess (if any)
of the Offer Price over the Initial Value (" _Unvested Phantom Stock Right
Consideration_ "). The Unvested Phantom Stock Right Consideration will be
subject to applicable withholdings and the Unvested Phantom Stock Right will
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth
in the Phantom Stock Plan and the agreements evidencing the grant thereof,
including without limitation provisions with respect to vesting, provided that
payments of Unvested Phantom Stock Right Consideration will be made on the
last business day of the ParentÂ’s fiscal quarter in which the Unvested
Phantom Stock Rights to which the Unvested Phantom Stock Right Consideration
is attributable vest. For the avoidance of any doubt, if a holder of an
Unvested Phantom Stock Right fails to vest in any portion of his or her
Unvested Phantom Stock Right (including, but not limited to, due to a failure
to meet the applicable vesting requirements set forth in his or her agreement
evidencing the grant of such Unvested Phantom Stock Right), the Unvested
Phantom Stock Right Consideration relating to that portion shall be retained
by Parent and forfeited by such holder. Each payment of Unvested Phantom Stock
Right Consideration hereunder is intended to be a separate "payment" for
purposes of Section 409A of the Code and comply with or be exempt from
Section 409A of the Code, and any ambiguities hereunder will be resolved in a
manner to maintain such exemption from or compliance with Section 409A of the
Code.

 

(e) _Company Action_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take or
cause to be taken any and all actions necessary to give effect to the
treatment of the Company Options, Company RSUs and Company Phantom Stock
Rights pursuant to this _Section 6.8._ The Company shall provide or make
available all true, correct and complete copies of individual equity
award agreements to Parent as soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement (but not later than 15 days following the date hereof).
In addition, prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take or cause to
be taken any and all actions necessary to accelerate the vesting of any
Unvested Options and Unvested RSUs held by each non-employee member of the
Company Board.

 



-66- 6.9 _Company Employee Matters_.

 

(a) _Company ESPP_. The Company shall take all action necessary with respect
to the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _Company ESPP_ ")
such that the current offering in progress as of the date of this Agreement
shall be the final offering under the Company ESPP. If such offering has not
ended prior to the Effective Time, then, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company (x) shall take all actions necessary such that a date to be determined
by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP (but no later
than the Effective Time) shall be the last day of such offering (the " _Final
Purchase_ ") and (y) shall make such other pro-rata adjustments as may be
necessary to reflect the shortened and final offering but otherwise treating
such shortened and final offering as a fully effective and completed offering
for all purposes under the Company ESPP. In addition, effective as of the date
of this Agreement, the Company shall have taken all actions necessary such
that no new participant will be permitted to join the current offering in
progress under the Company ESPP. Unless it has earlier terminated, the
Company shall take all actions necessary so that the Company ESPP shall
terminate immediately prior to and effective as of the Effective Time, and
notice shall be given to participants in the Company ESPP as soon as
administratively practicable following the date of this Agreement describing
the Final Purchase and the termination of the Company ESPP pursuant to this
_Section 6.9_. All amounts withheld by the Company on behalf of the
participants in the Company ESPP that have not been used to purchase Company
Common Stock at or prior to the Effective Time will be returned to the
participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the Company ESPP.

 

(b) _Compensation_. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to those employees of the
Company who are employed by the Company as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and who continue to be actively employed by the Surviving
Corporation (or any Subsidiary thereof) during such one year period (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") base salary and base wages and short-term cash
incentive compensation opportunities (excluding equity based compensation)
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to such base salary and
base wages and short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities
(excluding equity based compensation) as in effect immediately prior to the
execution of this Agreement for similarly-situated employees of Parent.

 

(c) _Accrued Benefits_. With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick
or vacation time to which any U.S.-based Continuing Employee is entitled
pursuant to the personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, Company shall
cash out all such vacation at the Closing. With respect to any accrued but
unused personal, sick or vacation time to which any non-U.S.-based Continuing
Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or vacation policies, Laws
or Contracts applicable to such non-U.S.-based Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to and instruct its Subsidiaries to, as applicable (and without
duplication of benefits), assume the liability for such accrued personal, sick
or vacation time and allow such non-U.S.-based Continuing Employee to use
such accrued personal, sick or vacation time in accordance with the practice
and policies of the Parent and applicable Laws and Contracts.

 



-67- (d) _Severance_. Parent shall be solely responsible for all termination and
severance benefits (which benefits, for the avoidance of doubt, shall either
be provided under the plans of Parent or its Subsidiaries, or the Employee
Plans), costs, charges and liabilities of any nature incurred with respect to
the termination of any Continuing Employees after the Effective Time,
including any claims arising out of or relating to any mass layoff or similar
event under applicable Law occurring on or after the Effective Time.

 

(e) _Employee Benefits_. Parent agrees that all Continuing Employees shall be
eligible to continue to participate in the Surviving CorporationÂ’s health and
welfare benefit plans; _provided, however_ , that (i) nothing in this _Section
6.9_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation to amend or terminate any such health or welfare
benefit plan at any time and (ii) if Parent or the Surviving Corporation
terminates any such health or welfare benefit plan (a " _Terminated Plan_ "),
then (upon expiration of any appropriate transition period), the Continuing
Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Surviving CorporationÂ’s
health and welfare benefit plans (subject to applicable terms and conditions)
to the extent that coverage under such plans is replacing comparable coverage
under any such Terminated Plan. To the extent that service is relevant for
eligibility, vesting or allowances (including paid time off) under any health
or welfare benefit plan of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation, then
Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such
health or welfare benefit plan shall, for purposes of eligibility, vesting,
allowances and benefit accrual (including paid time off), credit Continuing
Employees for service prior to the Effective Time with the Company to the
same extent that such service was recognized prior to the Effective Time under
the corresponding health or welfare benefit plan of the Company. In addition,
Parent shall in no event apply a pre-existing condition or actively at work
or similar limitation, eligibility waiting period, evidence of insurability
requirement or other condition under any group health or welfare plan with
respect to the Continuing Employees and the eligible dependents of the
Continuing Employees, other than limitations or waiting periods that are
already in effect with respect to such individuals to the extent not satisfied
as of the Effective Time under the corresponding Employee Plan. To the extent
that any Continuing Employee or any eligible dependent of a Continuing
Employee is transferred during a plan year from coverage under one or more of
the Employee Plans to coverage under a successor group health and welfare
plan, Parent shall, or shall cause the Company to, provide the affected
Continuing Employee, or eligible dependent with credit for any co-payments,
deductibles and offsets (or similar payments) made during the plan year in
which the transfer occurs for the purposes of satisfying any applicable
deductible, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under any such successor
benefit plan, program or arrangement. In the event Parent or the Surviving
Corporation terminates any Employee Plan that is a Section 125 plan
flexible spending arrangement, Surviving Corporation shall transfer and
Parent shall accept the flexible spending account elections and accounts of
the Continuing Employees.

 

(f) _401(k) Plan_. The Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans
maintained by the Company or any ERISA Affiliates (each a " _401(k) Plan_ "),
in each case effective as of the day immediately preceding the date the
Company becomes a member of the same controlled group of corporations (as
defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the " _401(k) Termination
Date_ "), unless Parent provides written notice (at least three (3) business
days prior to the date the Company becomes a member of the same controlled
group of corporations as Parent) to the Company that such 401(k) Plan(s)
shall not be terminated. The

 



-68-  Company shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k) plan(s) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the
Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as applicable.
The Company shall also take such other actions in furtherance of terminating
any such 401(k) Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably request. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to allow the Continuing Employees to rollover
any associated loan notes to the extent permitted under the Company 401(k)
Plan. Parent shall take all steps necessary to permit each such Continuing
Employee who has received an eligible rollover distribution (as defined
in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Company 401(k) Plan to roll such
eligible rollover distribution, including, for a reasonable period of time
following the Effective Time, any associated loans into an account under a
401(k) plan maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries to the extent
permissible under such 401(k) plan, provided that Parent shall undertake
commercially reasonable efforts for a reasonable period of time following the
Effective Time to amend the 401(k) plan maintained by Parent to permit such
roll over.

(g) _Termination of Company Plans_. The Company shall terminate any and all
Company Stock Plans, group severance, separation, deferred compensation or
salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements maintained by the Company
or any of its ERISA Affiliates and other Company Employee Plans that are set
forth  _Section 6.9(g)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in each case
effective as of the day immediately preceding the last day of the initial
period of the Offer, except as otherwise described in _Section 6.9(g)(ii) _of
the Company Disclosure Schedule. For the avoidance of any doubt, the
termination of all group severance, separation and salary continuation plans,
programs or arrangements pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be effected
without any payment (or giving rights to any payment) thereunder. The Company
shall provide Parent evidence that such plans have been terminated pursuant to
resolutions of the Company Board or the board of directors of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable (the form and substance of which resolutions
shall be subject to review and approval of Parent).

(h) _No Third Party Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, no provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i)
guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the ability of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation to terminate, any Employee
for any reason, or (ii) require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to
continue any Employee Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or
termination thereof on and after the Effective Time.

 

6.10 _Company Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under their respective certificates of incorporation and bylaws
(and other similar organizational documents) and all indemnification
agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement between the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former
directors and officers (the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ").

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the CompanyÂ’s current
directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’

 



-69-  liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Acceptance Time, covering each person covered by
the DandO Insurance as of the date of this Agreement, on terms with respect to
the coverage and amounts no less favorable, in the aggregate, than those of
the DandO Insurance in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided, however_
, that the Surviving Corporation may, at its option, substitute therefor
policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to such persons than the DandO Insurance,
_provided, further_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section
6.10(b)_ Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay
annual premiums in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the amount paid by
the Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such two hundred
percent (200%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ ") (which premiums the
Company represents and warrants to be as set forth in _Section 6.10(b) _of
the Company Disclosure Schedule), _provided, further,_ that that if the annual
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior
to the Acceptance Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, Parent may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy (the "
_Tail Policy_ ") on the DandO Insurance on terms and conditions no less
favorable, in the aggregate, than the DandO Insurance. In the event that Parent
purchases such a Tail Policy prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such Tail Policy in full force and effect
and continue to honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all
other obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the
first sentence of this _Section 6.10(b)_ for so long as such Tail Policy
shall be maintained in full force and effect.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section 6.10_.

(d) The obligations under this _Section 6.10_ shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Company Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the
DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) without the prior written consent of such affected
Company Indemnified Party or other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and
their heirs and representatives). Each of the Company Indemnified Parties or
other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy
referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their heirs and representatives) are
intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.10_, with full
rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the Company
Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy referred to in _Section 6.10(b)_ (and their
heirs and representatives)) under this _Section 6.10_ shall be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have
under the certificate or articles of incorporation, bylaws or other
equivalent organizational documents, any and all indemnification agreements of
or entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable Law
(whether at law or in equity).

 



-70- 6.11 _Section 16 Matters_.

 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be
required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act any dispositions of shares of Company Shares (including
derivative securities with respect to such shares) that are treated as
dispositions under such rule and result from the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby by each director or officer of the
Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act with respect to the Company.

 

6.12 _Compensation Committee Approval of New Compensation Arrangements_.

 

Prior to the Effective Time, the Company (acting through its Compensation
Committee) will take all steps that may be necessary or advisable to cause
each compensation arrangement entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after the date of this Agreement to be approved by the
Compensation Committee (comprised solely of "independent directors" determined
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act) as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)
of the Exchange Act. To the extent such actions are taken by resolution or
consent, the form and substance of such resolutions or consents shall be in
writing and be subject to review and approval of Parent, which shall not be
unreasonably delayed or withheld.

6.13 _Termination of Certain Agreements_.

 

The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to terminate each of the
agreements listed in _Section 6.13_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the
" _Terminated Agreements_ "), effective as of and contingent upon the Closing,
including sending all required notices, such that each such agreement shall be
of no further force or effect immediately following the Effective Time. Upon
the Closing, the Company shall have paid all amounts owed under the Terminated
Agreements (as a result of the termination of the Terminated Agreements or
otherwise), and the Surviving Corporation will not incur any claim, liability
or obligation (absolute, accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or
otherwise) under any Terminated Agreement following the Closing Date. The
Company shall be responsible for making any payments required to terminate the
Terminated Agreements. In the event the Offer or the Merger does not close
for any reason, Parent shall not have any liability to the Company, the
stockholders of the Company or any other Person for any costs, claims,
liabilities or damages resulting from the Company seeking to obtain such
terminations.

6.14 _Export Control Voluntary Disclosure_.

 

Should U.S. export violations by the Company be identified by Parent or the
Company prior to the Closing, the Company shall, no later than the Closing
Date, prepare and file to the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (the "
_BIS_ ") and Office of Foreign Assets Control (" _OFAC_ ") an initial
voluntary self-disclosure in writing of (a) any exports of Company products,
source code or technology prior to obtaining proper authorization for such
exportations, (b) any exports to prohibited countries or end-users as
identified in the regulations enforced by BIS and OFAC, and (c) any other
information regarding any Company export violations.

 



-71- 6.15 _Obligations of Merger Sub_.

 

Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Offer and the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement. Immediately following the execution of this Agreement,
Parent shall execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL
and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent
adopting this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE VII

7.1 _Termination Prior to Acceptance Time_.

 

This Agreement may be validly terminated, and the Offer may be terminated and
abandoned, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time only as follows:

(a) by mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company; or

 

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Offer shall have expired or been
terminated in accordance with the terms hereof without Merger Sub (or Parent
on Merger SubÂ’s behalf) having accepted for payment any Company Shares
pursuant to the Offer; _provided, however_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be available to any
party hereto whose action or failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted (i) in any of the
conditions to the Offer Conditions having failed to be satisfied, or (ii) in
the expiration or termination of the Offer in accordance with the terms
hereof without Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger SubÂ’s behalf) having accepted
for payment any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, and in either such case,
such action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement; or

(c) by either Parent or the Company, if Merger Sub (or Parent on Merger SubÂ’s
behalf) shall not have accepted for payment any Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer on or before October 27, 2015 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided
however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be available to any party hereto whose action or
failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the principal
cause of or resulted (i) in any of the Offer Conditions having failed to be
satisfied on or before the Termination Date, or (ii) in the expiration or
termination of the Offer in accordance with the terms hereof without Merger
Sub (or Parent on Merger SubÂ’s behalf) having accepted for payment
any Company Shares pursuant to the Offer, and in either such case, such
action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of this Agreement; or

 

(d) by the Company, in the event (i) of a breach of any covenant or agreement
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement that has, or
would reasonably be

representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement shall have become inaccurate in a manner that has, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect; _provided,
however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach
by Parent or Merger Sub, or such inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of Parent or Merger Sub, are curable by Parent or Merger Sub
through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then the Company
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section
7.1(d)_ until the earlier to occur of (A) twenty (20) calendar days after
delivery of written notice from the Company to Parent of such breach or
inaccuracy, as applicable or (B) the termination by Parent and Merger Sub of
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy (it being
understood that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(d)_ if such breach or inaccuracy by Parent or Merger Sub is
cured within such twenty (20)) calendar day period); or

(e) by Parent, in the event (i) of a breach of any covenant or agreement
on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 1.1(b)(iii)_ would not reasonably be
expected to be satisfied at the time of such breach (assuming for such
purposes that the time of such breach was the scheduled expiration of the
Offer), or (ii) that any representation or warranty of the Company set forth
in this Agreement shall have become inaccurate such that the conditions set
forth in _Section 1.1(b)(iv)_ would not reasonably be expected to be
satisfied as of the time such representation and warranty became inaccurate
(assuming for such purposes that the time of such inaccuracy was the scheduled
expiration of the Offer); _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that such breach by the Company, or such inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties of the Company, are curable by the
Company through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then
Parent shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(e)_ until the earlier to occur of (A) twenty (20) calendar day
period after delivery of written notice from Parent to the Company of such
breach or inaccuracy, as applicable, or (B) the termination by the Company of
commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy (it being
understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(e)_ if such breach or inaccuracy by the Company is cured within
such twenty (20) calendar day period); or
