in part, any Offer Condition, to increase the Offer Price, or to make any
other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; provided, however,
that unless otherwise provided by this Agreement or as previously approved in
writing by the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price,
(iii) waive or change the Minimum Condition, (iv) add to or amend or modify
any Offer Condition in a manner adverse in any material respect to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, (v) except as otherwise provided in this
_Section 2.1_, extend or otherwise change the expiration date of the Offer,
(vi) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer in any material
respect, (vii) otherwise amend, modify or supplement any of the terms of the
Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock,
(viii) provide any "subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof)
within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ix)
take any action (or fail to take any action) that breaches this Agreement with
the result that the Merger is not permitted to be effected pursuant to Section
251(h) of the DGCL.

 



 

(d) The Offer shall expire at midnight (eastern time) on the date that is
twenty (20) Business Days (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3)
under the Exchange Act) following the Offer Commencement Date (the " _Initial
Expiration Time_ ") or, in the event the Initial Expiration Time has been
extended pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, the date and time
to which the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Time, or such
later date and time to which the Initial Expiration Time has been extended
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement, is referred to as the "
_Expiration Time_ ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but subject to
the Parties respective termination rights under _Article IX_, Merger Sub (i)
may, in its sole discretion, without consent of the Company, extend the Offer
on one or more occasions, for an additional period of up to ten (10) Business
Days per extension, if on any then-scheduled Expiration Time any of the Offer
Conditions shall not be satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Merger Sub,
waived in Merger Subs sole discretion, until such time as such condition or
conditions are satisfied or waived, (ii) shall extend the Offer for any period
required by

 



      
 

 



 

applicable Law, any interpretation or position of the SEC, the staff thereof,
NASDAQ or the staff thereof applicable to the Offer, and until any waiting
period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the " _HSR
Act_ "), and any other applicable Antitrust Law shall have expired or been
terminated, and (iii) if, as of the then-scheduled Expiration Time, any Offer
Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived, at the written request of
the Company, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend
the Offer on one or more occasions (not to exceed two in total) for an
additional period of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit
such Offer Condition to be satisfied; provided, however, that in no event
shall (A) Merger Sub be required or permitted (without the prior written
consent of the Company) to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date, or (B)
the Company be permitted (without the prior written consent of Parent) to
request that the Offer be extended beyond the Outside Date.

 



 

(f) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to
any withholding of Tax pursuant to _Section 4.5_) all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
as soon as practicable after the Expiration Time (as it may be extended and
re-extended in accordance with this _Section 2.1_). Acceptance for payment of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and subject to the Offer Conditions
upon the Expiration Time is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer
Closing_ ," and the date on which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing Date_." Merger Sub expressly reserves
the right to, in its sole discretion, following the Offer Closing, extend the
Offer for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions thereof)
in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act, and the Offer Documents
may, in Merger Subs sole discretion, provide for such a reservation of right.
Nothing contained in this _Section 2.1_ shall affect any termination rights
in _Article IX_.

 



 

(g) Merger Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled Expiration
Time without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article IX_. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Article IX_, prior to the acceptance for payment of the Company
Common Stock tendered in the Offer, Merger Sub shall promptly (and in any
event within one (1) Business Day after such termination) return, and shall
cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered
Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

 



 

(h) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger
Sub shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits
thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits,
the Offer to Purchase and the form of Letter of Transmittal (such Schedule TO
and the documents attached as exhibits thereto, together with any amendments
and supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Promptly following
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall furnish to Parent and Merger
Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act to be
set forth in the Offer Documents. Parent and Merger Sub agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the

 



       
 

 



 

extent required by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations of NASDAQ.
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law. Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause
the Offer Documents, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to
the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents,
and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all correspondence
between them and their Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the
other hand. Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including any
amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to
the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any material comments of the
SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide
the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such Offer Documents or response to any material comments, and Parent and
Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any such
comments.

 



 

(i) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub, on a timely
basis, the funds necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for, pursuant to
the Offer.

 



 

Section 2.2 _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and, subject to _Section 7.3_,
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Company Recommendation, as it may
be amended, modified or withdrawn in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

(b) As soon as practicable on the Offer Commencement Date after Parent and
Merger Sub file with the SEC the Schedule TO, the Company shall file with the
SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
" _Schedule 14D-9_ ") that shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 7.3_,
contain the Company Recommendation. The Schedule 14D-9 shall also contain the
notice of appraisal rights required to be delivered by the Company under
Section 262(d) of the DGCL at the time the Company first files the Schedule
14D-9 with the SEC. The Company shall set the Stockholder List Date as the
record date for the Companys stockholders entitled to receive such notice of
appraisal rights and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 including such
notice of appraisal rights to the Companys stockholders to the extent
required by Section 262(d) of the DGCL at the first time the Company files the
Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC. The Company agrees to take all steps necessary to
cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be prepared and filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, agree
to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law.
The

 



      
 

 



 

Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so corrected (if applicable), to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company, in each case as and to the
extent required by the Exchange Act and other applicable Law. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent and Merger Sub upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to
the Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide Parent and Merger Sub with
copies of all correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Schedule
14D-9 (including any amendments or supplements thereto) with the SEC or
dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or responding to any
material comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company
shall provide Parent, Merger Sub, and their counsel a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response to any material
comments, and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any such comments.

 



 

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly after the date
hereof (and in any event at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Offer
Commencement Date) furnish or cause to be furnished to Parent and Merger Sub
mailing labels, security position listings and any other available listings or
computer files containing the names and addresses of the record holders or
beneficial owners of the shares of Company Common Stock as of the most recent
practicable date, and shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such
information and assistance (including lists of record holders or beneficial
owners of the shares of Company Common Stock, updated from time to time upon
Parents, Merger Subs or either of their respective agents request, and the
addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions of such record
holders or beneficial owners) as Parent, Merger Sub or either of their
respective agents may reasonably request for the purpose of communicating the
Offer to the record holders and beneficial owners of the shares of Company
Common Stock (the date of the list used to determine the persons to whom the
Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _Stockholder
List Date_ "). Subject to applicable Law, and except for such actions as may
be reasonably necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Merger, Merger Sub and Parent shall hold
in confidence the information and documents provided to them under this
_Section 2.2(c)_, shall use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement is terminated, shall, upon written
request, at Parents option, deliver to the Company or destroy (and confirm
such destruction in writing) all such information and documents (along with
all copies thereof) then in their possession or control, other than such
information that is contained in their computer system in accordance with
backup, security and/or disaster recovery procedures and is not otherwise
generally accessible or required to be retained by Law.

 



 

(d) The Company shall register (and shall cause its transfer agent to register
on the Companys stock transfer records) the transfer of shares of Company
Common Stock accepted for payment by Merger Sub effective immediately after
the Offer Closing.

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 **CONVERSION OF SHARES; 
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES**

 



 

Section 4.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) __Conversion; Cancellation; Treatment__. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any of the Parties or the
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or common stock of Merger Sub:

 



 

(i) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any Cancelled Shares and any
Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
an amount per share equal to the Offer Price in cash, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), less any applicable withholding Tax. From and after
the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (including all
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form
(" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ")) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and, subject to _Section 4.1(b),_ each
applicable holder of such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration upon the surrender of such shares of Company Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 4.2_.

 



 

(ii) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned or held in treasury
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company and each share of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that is owned by Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent (including Merger Sub) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_
"), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub shall be automatically
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. From and after the
Effective Time, all certificates representing shares of Merger Sub common
stock shall be deemed to represent the number of shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation as provided in the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

(b) __Shares of Dissenting Stockholders__. Notwithstanding any provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder of
record who did not vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement (or consent
thereto in writing) and is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal
of such shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all
respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _DGCL 262_ " and any such shares
meeting the requirement of this sentence, " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead
at the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive payment of
such amounts as are payable in accordance with DGCL 262 (it being understood
and acknowledged that at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
other than the right to receive such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to DGCL 262); provided, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to payment of the fair
value of such Dissenting Shares under DGCL 262, then the right of such holder
to be paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, without interest or duplication, the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall give prompt written notice to Parent of any demands received by
the Company for appraisal of any Company Common Stock, of any withdrawals of
such demands and of any other demands, notices or instruments served pursuant
to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to DGCL 262 and any alleged
dissenters rights, and Parent shall have the opportunity to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise
or offer to settle or compromise, any such demand, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 



 

(c) __Certain Adjustments__. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class of shares by
reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, option exercises, or
any similar event that has been approved by Parent in writing in advance
pursuant to this Agreement shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration
(to the extent the Offer Price was not adjusted to give effect to any such
change) shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally
reflect such change; provided, that nothing in this _Section 4.1(c)_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action with respect to the Company
Common Stock that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) __Appointment of Payment Agent__. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall appoint American Stock Transfer and Trust Company or another reputable
bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as
payment agent (the " _Payment Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger
Consideration in the Merger and shall enter into an agreement relating to the
Payment Agents responsibilities under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) __Deposit of Merger Consideration__. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall make or cause to be made available to the Payment Agent cash
sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration payable in the Merger at
such time as is necessary for the payment to holders of Company Common Stock
(other than with respect to Cancelled Shares and/or Dissenting Shares) (the "
_Payment Fund_ "). The Payment Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Payment Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment
or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares, and following any losses from any such investment Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Payment Agent for the benefit
of the holders of the Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount
of such losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the
Payment Fund. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent or its designee, upon demand. Parent shall cause the
Payment Fund to be held for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common
Stock entitled to payment of the Merger Consideration. The Payment Fund shall
not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section
4.1_ and _Section 4.3(c)_, except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) __Exchange Procedures__. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within ten (10) Business Days of the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of record of
shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted pursuant to _Section 4.1(a)(i)_ into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment Agent and
shall be in customary form) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) __Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares__. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Payment Agent together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Payment Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to the Merger and this Agreement
promptly following the Payment Agents receipt of such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share and such other
documents referred to above, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. In
the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is
not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be
paid upon due surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share formerly
representing such shares of Company Common Stock may be paid to such a
transferee

 



      
 

 



 

if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Payment Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence to the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that any applicable stock
transfer or other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No
interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate or Book-Entry Share.

 



 

(e) __No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock__. The cash paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article IV_ in respect of any shares of
Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been delivered and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock
(subject to DGCL 262). From and after the Effective Time, all holders of
shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights as stockholders
of the Company other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration into
which such shares have been converted pursuant to the Merger and this
Agreement upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing such shares in accordance with _Section 4.1_ or _Section
4.2(d)_, as applicable, in each case without interest or duplication. From and
after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock converted pursuant to this Agreement are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Payment Agent for any reason, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this _Article IV_, subject to DGCL 262 in the case of Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(f) __Termination of Payment Fund__. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Payment Agent in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall
be returned to the Parent upon demand. Any portion of the Payment Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for one (1) year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent or a Subsidiary of Parent designated by Parent,
upon written demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who
has not theretofore complied with this _Article IV_ shall thereafter look
only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws),
as general creditors thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon.

 



 

(g) __No Liability__. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the Payment
Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any person in
respect of any portion of the Payment Fund or the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, any portion of the Merger Consideration that remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the
second anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) __Lost Certificates__. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or
the Payment Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent or the Payment Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation
with respect to such Certificate, the Payment Agent (or, if subsequent to the
termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section 4.2(f),_ Parent)
shall deliver or cause to be delivered, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration, subject to _Section 4.2(g)_.

 



 

Section 4.3 _Company Incentive Awards_.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, shall be
cancelled by virtue of the Merger without any action on the part of the holder
thereof in consideration for the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation as promptly as practicable (but no later than five (5) Business
Days) following the Effective Time, a cash payment, if any (without interest
and less applicable withholding Taxes) with respect thereto equal to the
product of (i) the number of vested shares of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
those whose vesting accelerates as of the Effective Time), and (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise or base price
per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation will not
assume any Company Stock Awards and will not substitute any options, unit
awards, restricted shares or other rights to acquire shares of the capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) Each Company RSU Award and each Company Performance Share Unit Award that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested
or unvested, shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger without any action on
the part of the holder thereof in consideration for the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation as promptly as practicable (but no later than five
(5) Business Days) following the Effective Time, a cash payment, if any
(without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes) with respect thereto
equal to the product of (i) the number of vested shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company RSU Award or Company Performance Share Unit
Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (including those whose

contractual obligations to which they are bound concerning the collection,
storage, handling, use, disclosure, transmissions, possession, disposal,
processing, or any breach of any Personal Information. The Surviving
Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries will have the right to use any Personal

identify internal and external risks to the security of any confidential
information and any Personal Information held or used by them, and (ii)
implement, monitor and improve safeguards to control those risks. Since
January 1, 2014, there have been no actual or suspected, and there is no basis
for the Company to reasonably believe there were any, (y) breaches of the
security of the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries computer systems,
networks or servers which required notice to any third party, or (z) breach of
the security of any of the Companys or its Subsidiaries contractors
computer systems, networks or servers which required notice to any third
party, and to the Companys knowledge, there is no reason or reasons to expect
that such a breach or any other unauthorized use, access, or disclosure of
Personal Information or confidential information has occurred.

Policies are valid, outstanding and enforceable policies. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has been refused any insurance with

 



      
 

 



 

respect to the business or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
No Insurance Policy provides for or is subject to any currently enforceable
retroactive rate or premium adjustment, loss sharing arrangement or other
actual or contingent Liability arising wholly or partially out of events
arising prior to the Effective Time. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice from or on behalf of any
insurance carrier issuing any Insurance Policy that insurance rates therefor
shall hereafter be substantially increased (except to the extent insurance
rates may be increased for all similarly situated risks) or that there shall
hereafter be a cancellation or an increase in a deductible (or an increase in
premiums to maintain an existing deductible) or nonrenewal of any Insurance
Policy.

and its Representatives (including the Financing Sources and their respective

Confidentiality Agreement or a joinder to the Confidentiality Agreement)
reasonable access during normal business hours (unless otherwise agreed to by

this Agreement in accordance with _Article IX_ and the Effective Time, to its
and its Subsidiaries executive officers, outside accountants, properties,
Contracts, books and records and, during such period, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide to Parent such other available
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request from time to time. The foregoing notwithstanding, the
Company shall not be required to provide access to any such person, any such
document or any such information if doing so would, in the reasonable good
faith judgment of the Company and its outside counsel, violate any Law,
violate any of its or its Affiliates respective obligations to third parties
with respect to confidentiality, or result in the loss of legal protection,
including the attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided, that the Company will inform
Parent of the general nature of the document or information being withheld and
reasonably cooperate with Parent to provide such document or information in a
manner that would not result in violation of Law or the loss or waiver of such
privilege. Any access or investigation pursuant to this _Section 7.2(a)_
shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business and operations of the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries.
No investigation by Parent or its Representatives shall affect or be deemed to
modify or waive the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
this Agreement, or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available to Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Parties hereby agree that all information provided to them or their
respective Representatives in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the Offer and the Merger shall be governed by that certain
Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement between the Company and Parent, executed by the
Company on October 26, 2016 and by the Parent on October 12, 2016 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which shall survive any termination of this
Agreement in accordance with the terms set forth therein.

 



 

(c) From and after the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company and
Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and
Representatives to, use reasonable efforts, subject to applicable Law and the
approval of their respective legal counsel, to cooperate with the other Party
in connection with planning the integration of the business operations of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent and their respective Subsidiaries following
the Closing. In furtherance of the foregoing, promptly following the date
hereof, each of Parent and the

 



      
 

 



 

Company shall designate two individuals to serve on an integration committee,
with such committee meeting at least monthly (subject to applicable Law and
the approval of their respective legal counsel) and as otherwise reasonably

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 7.3_, the Company shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, financial advisors, investment bankers, tax

(collectively, " _Representatives_ "): (i) to immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any and all solicitation, encouragement, discussions or
negotiations with any persons or group of persons (other than Parent and its
Affiliates) that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal
and (ii) not to, directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or discussions regarding, or
the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (B) engage in, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
any information in connection with, or afford access to the assets, business,
properties, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to any
other person for the purpose of soliciting, initiating, knowingly encouraging
or knowingly facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal (other than (x) solely
in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to inform the inquiring person that the
Company is bound by the non-solicitation provisions set forth in this _Section
7.3_ and to limit its communication exclusively to such response, or (y) upon
receipt of a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any
person that did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.3_, solely to the
extent necessary to ascertain facts or clarify terms with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal for the Company Board of Directors to be able to have
sufficient information to make the determination described in _Section
7.3(c)_), or (C) approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, or propose to
approve, adopt, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent, term sheet or
similar document, Contract or agreement in principle (whether written or oral,
binding or nonbinding) with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal. The
Company shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, release any third
party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission
under, or fail to enforce, any confidentiality obligations with respect to a
Company Takeover Proposal or similar matter or any standstill provision in any
agreement to which the Company or any of its Affiliates is a party, in each
case, unless the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to do so would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

 



 

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly request any
person that has executed a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement
executed after January 1, 2016 in connection with any actual or potential
Company Takeover Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information in
the possession of such person or its Representatives.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 7.3(a)_,
if at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer
Closing, but not after, the Company or any of its Representatives receives a
bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal from any person that
did not result from a breach of this _Section 7.3_ and if the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with
its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Company
Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Company Superior Proposal, then the Company and its Representatives may (i)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (a copy of which
will be provided to Parent within 24 hours of being executed), information
with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person who has made
such Company Takeover Proposal; provided, that the Company shall concurrently
with the delivery to such person provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made
available to such person or its Representatives unless such non-public
information has been previously provided or Made Available to Parent, and (ii)
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives regarding
such Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent in writing if the Company
Board of Directors makes a determination that a Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expect to result in a Company Superior
Proposal or if the Company furnishes information or enters into discussions or
negotiations as provided in this _Section 7.3(c)_.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable (and in no event later than within one (1) Business Day after the
Companys receipt or it has knowledge of the receipt by any of its
Representatives) notify Parent in writing in the event that the Company or any
of its Representatives receives a Company Takeover Proposal or a request for
information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries that constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in or that contemplates a Company
Takeover Proposal, including the identity of the person making the Company
Takeover Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof (including an
unredacted copy of such Company Takeover Proposal or, where such Company
Takeover Proposal is not in writing, a description of the terms and conditions
thereof). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably
current basis, as to the status of (including any developments, discussions or
negotiations) such Company Takeover Proposal (including by as promptly as
practicable (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day after the
Companys receipt or it has knowledge of the receipt by any of its
Representatives) providing to Parent copies of any correspondence, proposals,
indications of interest or draft agreements relating to such Company Takeover
Proposal). The Company shall provide Parent with at least one (1) Business
Days prior notice of any meeting of the Company Board of Directors (or such
lesser notice as is provided to the members of the Company Board of Directors)
at which the Company Board of Directors is reasonably expected to consider any
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company agrees that it and its Affiliates will
not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent
in accordance with, or otherwise complying with, this _Section 7.3(d)_.

Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the

authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation or (C)
adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company, or resolve to or
publicly propose or announce its intention to adopt, approve or recommend to

 



      
 

 



 

stockholders of the Company a Company Takeover Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
"), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, indication of
interest (countersigned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) or Contract
(including an acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement
or other agreement) with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 7.3(c)_) (any of the foregoing, a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_
").

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer Closing, but not
after, the Company Board of Directors may, with respect to a bona fide,
unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 7.3_, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.1(f)_ in
order to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such Company Takeover
Proposal if and only if, prior to taking either such action, (i) the Company
has complied with its obligations under this _Section 7.3_, and (ii) the
Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such
Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal; provided,
that prior to making such Adverse Recommendation Change or effecting such
termination, (A) the Company has given Parent at least four (4) Business Days
prior notice of its intention to take such action, specifying the reasons
therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the
person making, any such Company Superior Proposal and has contemporaneously
provided to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal, a copy of any
proposed Company Acquisition Agreements and a copy of any financing
commitments relating thereto (or, in each case, if not provided in writing to
the Company, a written summary of the terms and conditions thereof), (B) if
requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent and its Representatives during such notice period to enable Parent to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such
Company Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal,
(C) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors
shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation
with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect
and (D) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including
the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material
terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have
delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in
clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (C) of
this proviso shall commence (except that the four (4) Business Day notice
period referred to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal
to the longer of (x) three (3) Business Days and (y) the period remaining
under the notice period under clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to
the delivery of such additional notice under this clause (D)) during which
time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this
_Section 7.3(f)_ anew with respect to such additional notice, including
clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall enter into any Company Acquisition Agreement unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms.

may, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Offer
Closing, but not after, make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
an Intervening Event (an " _Intervening Event Recommendation Change_ ") if (i)
the Company has complied with its obligations under this _Section 7.3_ and
(ii) prior to taking such action, the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
constitute a violation of the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; provided, that prior to making such Intervening Event
Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has given Parent at least four (4)
Business Days prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and
specifying the reasons therefor, including specifying in reasonable detail the
applicable Intervening Event, (B) if requested by the Parent, the Company
shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and its Representatives during
such notice period to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement, and (C) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board
of Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that the failure to make an Intervening Event Recommendation Change would
violate the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(h) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.3_ shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board of Directors from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)(2)-(3), Rule 14d-9 or
Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard
to a Company Takeover Proposal, (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders
of the Company if the Company Board of Directors shall have determined, after
consultation with its independent financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
that failure to take such a position would violate the Company Board of
Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law or any disclosure
requirements under applicable Law or (iii) making any disclosure that
constitutes a "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Section 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act
pending disclosure of its position thereunder; provided, that no such action
or disclosure that would amount to an Adverse Recommendation Change shall be
permitted, made or taken other than in compliance with this _Section 7.3_.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and for a period of twelve (12) months
thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to each employee of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries who continues

thereof (the " _Continuing Employees_ "), other than Continuing Employees with
a written employment Contract with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary thereof, (i) base salary or wages and target bonus opportunities
(but excluding any equity-based compensation) that are no less favorable than
the base salary or wages and target bonus opportunities (but excluding any
equity-based compensation) provided by the Company to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any equity based
compensation), (ii) employee benefits (other than severance benefits) that
are, in the aggregate, comparable to those provided to the Continuing
Employees

are, in the aggregate, no less favorable than those provided by the Company to
the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following
the Closing, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, that periods of employment with the Company (including any current or
former affiliate of the Company or any predecessor of the Company) shall be
taken into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting (excluding equity
compensation vesting) and waiting periods under all employee benefit plans
maintained by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent for the benefit of the
Continuing Employees (other than as would result in a duplication of benefits
or if such service was not recognized under the corresponding Company Benefit
Plan).

 



 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause all
medical, dental and other welfare plans in which Continuing Employees
participate from and after the Effective Time to (i) waive any exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such Continuing Employees under any medical, dental or other
welfare plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates to the extent such
exclusions did not apply under the corresponding Company Benefit Plan as of
the Closing, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to honor any
deductible and out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employees
and dependents under similar employee plans for the plan year in which such
participation begins.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee any
right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or restrict in
any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of
Parent, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or terminate
the services of any Continuing Employee at any time for any reason whatsoever,
with or without cause. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 7.4_ shall (i) be deemed or construed to
be an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or employee
benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates, (ii) create any right in any
Continuing Employee or any other person to compensation or benefits of any
nature or kind whatsoever, or (iii) create any third party rights in any
current or former service provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



 

(d) With respect to matters described in this _Section 7.4_, the Company will
not send any written notices or written communication materials or provide any
other form of communication to any Continuing Employee or any other persons
without the prior written consent of Parent.

any reporting requirements, payments, costs and/or Liabilities that arise
under the WARN Act as a result of the termination of any employee prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(f) The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, take any and all
actions, including the Company Board of Directors approving such resolutions
and adopting such amendments, in a form satisfactory to Parent, required to
terminate all Company Benefit Plans that include a salary reduction feature
subject to Section 401(k) of the Code, with such termination to be effective
prior to the Offer Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.5 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.5(b)_, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to submit all
notifications to and obtain all authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals
of any Governmental Entity that may be or become necessary for its execution
and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement, (ii) cooperate fully in promptly submitting all notifications and
seeking to obtain all such authorizations, consents, Orders and approvals, and
(iii) provide such other information to any Governmental Entity as such
Governmental Entity may reasonably request in connection herewith. Each Party

following the execution of this Agreement) its respective filing, pursuant to
the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental
Entities any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each Party agrees to make as promptly as
practicable its respective filings and notifications, if any, under any other
applicable Antitrust Law and to supply as promptly as practicable to the
appropriate Governmental Entities any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested pursuant to such applicable Antitrust Law.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates shall be required
to, and the Company may not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take any
action with respect to, any requirement, condition, limitation, understanding,
agreement or Order to: (i) sell, license, assign, transfer, divest, hold
separate, or otherwise dispose of any assets, business or portion of business
of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, (ii) conduct, restrict, operate, invest, or otherwise
change the assets, business, or portion of business of the Company, the

Affiliates in any manner, or (iii) impose any restriction, requirement or
limitation on the operation of the business or portion of the business of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates; _provided, that,_ if requested by Parent, the Company
will become subject to, consent to, or offer or agree to, or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any such requirement, condition, limitation,
understanding, agreement or Order so long as such requirement, condition,
limitation, understanding, agreement or Order is only binding on the Company
in the event the Closing occurs.

 



 

(c) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any communication
received from, or given by such Party or any of its Affiliates to, any
Governmental Entity or person relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement and shall permit the other Party to review in advance any
proposed communication by such Party (and its advisors) to any Governmental
Entity. None of the Parties shall agree to participate in any substantive
meeting or conference, whether in person or by telephone, with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any

 



      
 

 



 

filings, investigation (including any settlement of the investigation),
litigation or other inquiry unless it consults with the other Party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
Party the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. The Parties
shall coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such
information and providing such assistance as the other Party may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing. The Parties shall provide each other
with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications between them or
any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company may,
as each deems advisable and necessary, (i) redact or remove references
concerning the valuation of the businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and (ii) reasonably designate any competitively sensitive or any
confidential business material provided to the other under this _Section
7.5(c)_ as "counsel only" or, as appropriate, as "outside counsel only."

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that Parent shall control and direct, and the
Company will cooperate reasonably, subject to applicable Law, with such
direction and control, regarding the filings (including where to file),
strategies, process, negotiation of settlements (if any), and related
proceedings contemplated by this _Section 7.5_, including for the avoidance
of doubt the marketing or sale of any part of the businesses or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Any reasonable actions or strategies
pursued by Parent to avoid, resist or reduce the scope of any action that may
be sought or required to satisfy the conditions in clause (e) of _Exhibit A_
hereto shall be deemed consistent with its reasonable best efforts obligations
under this _Section 7.5_, so long as it does not delay satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ to a date beyond the Outside Date.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing, each of Parent and the Company (without limiting
_Section 7.1_) shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
a Contract to acquire or license, or acquire or license, any assets,
businesses or securities of a third party if such acquisition or license would
or would reasonably be expected to prevent or delay beyond the Outside Date
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clause (e) of _Exhibit A_ hereto.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. The Parties shall take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to be effective
without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section
251(h) of Delaware Law as soon as practicable following the consummation of
the Offer.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company shall take any and all actions
that are necessary or appropriate to cause the Offer and the Merger not to be
subject to any requirements imposed by any takeover statute. If any
"moratorium," "control share acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority,"
"affiliate transactions" or "business combination statute or regulation" or
other similar state anti-takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the Offer or the Merger, each of the Company and
Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the Offer, the Merger and any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent permissible under applicable
Law.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 7.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be a joint press release to be mutually agreed upon by Parent
and the Company. Thereafter, Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other and provide each other the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon any press release or other public announcement with respect to the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
before issuing any such press release or public announcement, and such Party
shall consider such comments in good faith; provided, however, in the case of
a press release or public announcement required by Law or the rules and
regulations of NASDAQ, the Party required to make the release or announcement
shall use its reasonable efforts to allow the other Party reasonable time to
comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance; and
provided, further, that the restrictions contained in this _Section 7.8_
shall not apply to releases or public statements (a) by the Company in
connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change, but subject to the Companys
and its Representatives compliance with _Section 7.3_, or Parent in response
thereto, or (b) by Parent, if a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been
publicly announced. In addition, each of the Company and Parent may make
public statements or announcements in response to questions by the press,
analysts, investors or analyst or investor calls, so long as such statements
or announcements are not inconsistent with any previous press release or
public announcement made in accordance with this _Section 7.8_.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from Liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
any present and former director and officer of the Company and any of its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (each, a " _Company
Indemnified Party_ " and together with such persons estate, executor and
administrator, collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") as
provided in the Company Organizational Documents (or Company Subsidiary
Organizational Documents) in effect as of the date hereof or any

any time on or prior to the nine (9) month anniversary of such termination,
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with
respect to, or consummates, any transaction included within the definition of
Company Takeover Proposal (provided that references in such definition to 15%
shall be deemed to be 50%) with any person (a " _Company Takeover Transaction_
"), whether or not such Company Takeover Transaction is the same as the
original Company Takeover Proposal made, commenced, submitted or announced,
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the
Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in
immediately available funds, upon the earlier of entering into such definitive
agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Transaction or the consummation
of any Company Takeover Transaction.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(g)_, the
Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Parent or its designee the
Termination Fee, by wire transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in
immediately available funds, within one (1) Business Date after the date of

(c) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_,

full pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 9.3_, the Company shall
have no further Liability of any kind for any reason in connection with this
Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other than as provided under
this _Section 9.3_ except in the case of fraud or any Willful Breach of any

Parent shall in addition be entitled to all rights and remedies available at

more than one payment of the Termination Fee in connection with a termination
of this Agreement pursuant to which such Termination Fee is payable.

 



 

(e) Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that payment of the Termination
Fee is not intended to be a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which
the Termination Fee are due and payable, and which do not involve fraud or
Willful Breach of this Agreement, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the Merger, which
amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.3_ are an
integral part of the Merger, and that, without these agreements, Parent and
Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company
fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant to this _Section
9.3_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent and its designee for all
costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of counsel)
incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in connection
with any related claims, actions, suits or proceedings commenced, and (ii) the
Company shall pay to Parent or its designee interest on such amount from and
including the date payment of such amount was due to but excluding the date of
actual payment at the prime rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made plus two percent.

conclusive and binding upon each of the Parties (subject to any appeal rights
of the Chosen Courts) and may be enforced in any other courts the jurisdiction
of which each of the Parties is or may be subject, by suit upon such judgment.
Each Party irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided
for notices in _Section 10.7_ and agrees that service made in such manner
shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party
personally within the State of Delaware. Nothing in this Agreement will affect
the right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties
acknowledge and irrevocably agree (1) that any suit, action or proceeding,
whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, involving the
Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to, the Offer, the Merger, the
Debt Financing or the performance of obligations thereunder or related thereto
will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court
sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and any appellate
court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its property with respect
to any such suit, action or proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
court, (2) not to bring or permit any of their Affiliates to bring or support
anyone else in bringing any such suit, action or proceeding in any other
court, (3) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
any objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any
such suit, action or proceeding in any such court, and (4) any such suit,
action or proceeding will be governed and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of New York.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage may occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it, including
monetary damages, each of the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the
Chosen Courts, and all such rights and remedies at law or in equity shall be
cumulative, except as may be limited by _Section 9.3_. The Parties further
agree that no Party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 10.5_; and each Party waives any
objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require
the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 10.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OFFER, THE MERGER OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING IN RESPECT OF THE
FINANCING SOURCES AND THE DEBT FINANCING).

Section 10.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated
by any of the Parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
Parties; provided, that each of Merger Sub and Parent may, without the prior
written consent of the Company, (a) assign any of their rights hereunder to an
Affiliate or a wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent or Merger
Sub, or (b) pledge its rights hereunder as security to any source of financing
to the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in each case, upon prior written
notice to the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger
Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement and no such pledge shall be
effective until the Effective Time. Subject to the first sentence of this
_Section 10.8_, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Any
purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 10.8_ shall be null
and void.

 



 

Section 10.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, such provision shall be interpreted to be only
so broad as is enforceable.

 



 

Section 10.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the exhibits
hereto, the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and this Agreement is
not intended to grant standing to any person other than the Parties hereto. In
the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter
(other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Company Disclosure
Letter), the statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

 



 

Section 10.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, provided however, that following the Offer
Closing, there shall be no amendment or supplement to the provisions of this
Agreement which by Law or in accordance with the rules of any relevant self-
regulatory organization would require further approval by the holders of
Company Common Stock. At any time and from time to time prior to the Effective
Time, either

 



      
 

 



 

the Company, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand,
may, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law and except as otherwise
set forth herein, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub, in the case of an extension
by the Company, or of the Company, in the case of an extension by Parent and
Merger Sub, as applicable, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such Party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements
or conditions for the benefit of any such Party contained herein; provided
however, that following the Offer Closing, there shall be no amendment or
supplement to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law or in accordance
with the rules of any relevant self-regulatory organization would require
further approval by the holders of Company Common Stock. The foregoing
notwithstanding, no failure or delay by any Party hereto in exercising any
right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other
right hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set forth in _Section 10.5_,
_Section 10.6_, _Section 10.13_, _Section 10.15_ and this _Section 10.11_
(and the defined terms used therein) may not be amended, modified or altered
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 10.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the Parties only and shall be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company agrees that (a) their respective representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth herein are solely for the benefit of the
Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement, and (b) except for
the provisions of _Section 7.9_, this Agreement is not intended to, and does
not, confer upon any person other than the Parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and
warranties set forth herein; provided the provisions of _Section 10.5_,
_Section 10.6_, _Section 10.11_, _Section 10.15_ and this _Section 10.13_
(and the defined terms used therein) will inure to the benefit of the
Financing Sources and their successors and assigns, each of whom are intended
to be third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that
the provisions of such sections will be enforceable by the Financing Sources
and their respective successors and assigns).

 



 

Section 10.14 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of
this Agreement unless otherwise expressly indicated. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement, unless expressly so limited. The words "this
Article," "this Section," and words of similar import refer only to the
Article and Section hereof in which such words occur. The word "since" when
used in this Agreement in reference to a date shall be deemed to be inclusive
of such date. All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein.

 



      
 

 



 

Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to
include any other gender, and words, terms and titles (including terms defined
herein) in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and vice
versa, unless the context otherwise requires. All references in this Agreement
to dollars or "$"refer to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided
for in this Agreement, the term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive.
References in this Agreement to specific Laws or to specific provisions of
Laws shall include all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and any
statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
referred to herein shall mean such statute as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented, including by succession of comparable successor
statutes. The words "day" or "days" shall mean calendar day, unless denoted as
a Business Day. Any drafts of this Agreement circulated by or among the
Parties prior to the fully executed version shall not be used for purposes of
interpreting any provision of this Agreement. Each of the Parties has
participated in the drafting and negotiation of this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement must
be construed as if it is drafted by all the Parties, and no presumption or
burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of
authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.15 _Waiver of Claims Against Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none of the Financing
Sources will have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise,
whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates will have any rights or claims against any
Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder.

 ** _EXHIBIT A_**

 



 

 ** _CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER_**

 



 

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ and not otherwise defined herein
will have the meanings set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger to which
this _Exhibit A_ is attached (the " _Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding any other
terms or provisions of the Offer or the Agreement, Merger Sub shall not be
obligated to accept for payment, and, subject to the rules and regulations of
the SEC (including Rule 14e-l(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act), shall
not be obligated to pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or
payment for, any validly tendered shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer (and not theretofore accepted for payment or paid for), if
immediately prior to the then scheduled Expiration Time, any of the following
conditions shall not have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted under
the Agreement and applicable Law, waived):

 



 

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company (i) set forth in
_Section 5.12(c)_ of the Agreement shall have been accurate in all respects
as of the date of the Agreement and shall be accurate in all respects at and
as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the
Expiration Time, (ii) set forth in _Section 5.1(a)_, _Section 5.1(b)_,
_Section 5.1(c)_, _Section 5.2_ (other the sixth sentence of _Section
5.2(a)_), _Section 5.3(a)_, _Section 5.19_, _Section 5.20_, _Section 5.23_
and _Section 5.26_ of the Agreement shall have been accurate in all respects
as of the date of the Agreement and shall be accurate in all respects at and
as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the
Expiration Time, (iii) set forth in _Section 5.1(d)_, the sixth sentence of
_Section 5.2(a)_, _Section 5.3(b)_, _Section 5.3(c)_ and _Section 5.21_,
of the Agreement shall have been accurate in all material respects as of the
date of the Agreement and shall be accurate in all material respects at and as
of the Expiration Time with the same effect as though made as of the
Expiration Time, and (iv) set forth in the Agreement, other than those
Sections specifically identified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this
paragraph (a), shall have been accurate (disregarding all qualifications or
limitations as to "materiality," "Company Material Adverse Effect" and words
of similar import set forth therein) as of the date of the Agreement and shall
be accurate (disregarding all qualifications or limitations as to
"materiality," "Company Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import
set forth therein) at and as of the Expiration Time with the same effect as
though made as of the Expiration Time, except, in the case of this clause
(iv), where the failure to be accurate, individually or in the aggregate,
would not and would not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect; provided that in each case, the representations and warranties
made as of a specific date shall be required to be so true and correct
(subject to the applicable qualifications) as of such date only.

 



 

(b) The Company shall have performed or complied in all material respects with
all covenants and obligations that the Company is required to comply with or
to perform under the Agreement on or prior to the Expiration Time.

 



 

(c) Parent shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company
by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company to
the effect that the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) above have been
satisfied.

      
 

 



 

(d) Since the date of the Agreement, there shall not have occurred a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) Any applicable waiting period (and any extensions thereof) under the HSR
Act relating to the Offer or the Merger shall have expired or been terminated,
and all other clearances or approvals (other than the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State) under applicable
Antitrust Laws shall have been obtained, free of any condition that would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(f) There shall not have been issued by any court of competent jurisdiction
that remains in effect any temporary restraining order, preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order preventing the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger nor shall any Law or Order that remains in effect have been
promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted, issued or deemed applicable to the
Offer or the Merger by any Governmental Entity which directly or indirectly
prohibits, or makes illegal, the acceptance for payment of or payment for
shares of Company Common Stock or the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

 



 

(g) There shall not be pending any legal proceeding by a Governmental Entity
having authority over Parent, Merger Sub or any Subsidiary thereof (i)
challenging or seeking to restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger, (ii) seeking to restrain or prohibit Parents or its Affiliates
ownership or operation of the business or assets of the Company or the
Companys Subsidiaries or of Parent or any of its Affiliates, or to compel
Parent or any of its Affiliates to dispose of or hold separate all or any
portion of the business or assets of the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or of Parent or any of its Affiliates, or (iii) seeking to impose
or confirm material limitations on the ability of Parent or any of its
Affiliates effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of
Company Common Stock, in each case that would constitute a restraint under
applicable Antitrust Law.

 



 

(h) Those approvals, consents, notices and waivers that are listed on _Section
A-1_ of the Company Disclosure Letter shall have been received or given and be
in full force and effect, and executed counterparts thereof shall have been
delivered to Parent.

 



 

(i) The Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(j) The RandW Policy shall have been issued.

 



 

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and
may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub, in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time, in the sole discretion of Parent and Merger Sub. The
failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing
rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.
