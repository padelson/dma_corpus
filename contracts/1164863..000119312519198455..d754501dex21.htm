the Purchaser shall purchase, acquire and accept from such Seller, all of such

the Securities pursuant to exercise of the Option in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

2.2 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. ET, at the offices of Gibson

conditions at the Closing), or in such other manner, by such other method or
process, on such other date and at such other place as agreed to by the
Purchaser and the Sellers, and shall be effective as of 12:01 a.m. ET, on
such date. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the
"Closing Date."

2.3 _Estimated Transaction Consideration; Allocation_.

2.3.1 At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall
deliver to the Purchaser a certificate setting forth a good faith estimate
and calculation of the amount of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working
Capital, the Closing Cash, the Accrued Tax Liabilities and the Selling
Expenses (the "Closing Certificate") as of 12:01 a.m. ET on the Closing Date,
in substantially the form set forth in, and in a manner consistent with,
_Schedule 2.3_ , including the types of adjustments set forth therein, and in
accordance with the definitions of Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working
Capital, Closing Cash, Accrued Tax Liabilities and Selling Expenses in this
Agreement. As used herein, "Estimated Closing Indebtedness," "Estimated

 Closing Working Capital," "Estimated Closing Cash," "Estimated Accrued Tax
Liabilities" and "Estimated Selling Expenses" mean the estimates of the
Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, Accrued
Tax Liabilities and the Selling Expenses, respectively, as set forth in the
Closing Certificate. "Estimated Transaction Consideration" shall mean an
amount equal to the Transaction Consideration, assuming, for purposes of such
calculation, the Closing Indebtedness is equal to the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital is equal to the Estimated Closing
Working Capital, the Estimated Closing Cash is equal to the Closing Cash, the
Accrued Tax Liabilities are equal to the Estimated Accrued Tax Liabilities,
and the Estimated Selling Expenses are equal to the Selling Expenses.
_Schedule 2.3_ contains a sample calculation of Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Working Capital, Closing Cash, Accrued Tax Liabilities and Selling Expenses as
if the Closing Date were the Balance Sheet Date.

 

2.3.2 At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing and concurrently
with the delivery of the Closing Certificate, the Sellers shall prepare and
deliver to the Purchaser a certificate (the "Allocation Certificate") that
shall set forth, as of the Closing Date, the following: (a) the portion and
percentage of the Estimated Transaction Consideration (such percentage, the
"Allocation Percentage") that is assigned for the sale and purchase of each of
the Acquired Entities (such amounts being assigned to the sale and purchase of
LTLLC and LTCO shall be referred to herein as the "Estimated US Transaction
Consideration" and the "Estimated Taiwan Transaction Consideration,"
respectively); (b) the name of each Seller, the number and class of Securities
held by each Seller, the portion of the Estimated US Transaction
Consideration and the Estimated Taiwan Transaction Consideration allocated to
each such Seller (including in respect of the Securities issued upon exercise
of the Option) consistent with Purchasers determination of total Estimated
US Transaction Consideration and total Estimated Taiwan Transaction
Consideration provided to Sellers, the actual amount of the Estimated Taiwan
Transaction Consideration payable to each such Seller and, with respect to
each Rollover Seller, the Rollover Amount of such Rollover Seller; and (c)
the estimated amount of Taiwan STT payable with respect to each Seller (the
"Estimated Taiwan STT"). The Parties agree that the Purchaser shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the Allocation Certificate in making
payments under _Article II_ and the Purchaser shall not be responsible for the
calculations or the determinations regarding such calculations in such
Allocation Certificate, and neither will the Acquired Entities, the Purchaser
nor any of their respective Affiliates after the Closing Date have any
liability to any Seller with respect to the allocation of the Transaction
Consideration pursuant to the Allocation Certificate.

 

2.3.3 At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing and concurrently
with the delivery of the Closing Certificate, the Sellers shall prepare and
deliver to the Purchaser (a) a then-current list of all Selling Expenses
incurred and unpaid to such date or otherwise reasonably expected to become
due or be incurred in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the identity of each
payee, amounts owed and instructions necessary to effect the payment in full
of such Selling Expenses, and copies of final invoices from each such payee
(the "Selling Expenses Payoff Instructions") for such reasonably expected or
incurred and unpaid Selling Expenses, and (b) with respect to each item of
Indebtedness set forth on _Schedule 2.3.3_ (the "Payoff Indebtedness"),
information and documentation necessary to effect the final payment in full
of the Payoff Indebtedness as of the Closing Date (the "Indebtedness Payoff
Schedule").

Payments"):

2.4.1 the Escrow Amount deposited by wire transfer of immediately available
funds into the Escrow Account established pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement;

2.4.2 the Working Capital Escrow Amount deposited by wire transfer of
immediately available funds into the Working Capital Escrow Account
established pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement;

 

2.4.3 the Sellers Representative Holdback Amount deposited by wire transfer
of immediately available funds into an account or accounts designated by the
Sellers Representative prior to Closing;

2.4.4 the aggregate dollar amount to satisfy any and all Payoff Indebtedness
(the "Closing Indebtedness Payments") to the applicable lenders identified in,
and in accordance with, the Indebtedness Payoff Schedule;

 

2.4.5 the aggregate dollar amount to satisfy any Selling Expenses (other than
the Estimated Taiwan STT) that remain unpaid at Closing to the Persons
entitled thereto in accordance with the Selling Expenses Payoff Instructions;

2.4.6 to the Taiwan Tax Authority, the applicable Estimated Taiwan STT
respect to the sale and purchase of LTCO; and

2.4.7 the balance of the Estimated Transaction Consideration  _less_ the
Rollover Amount (the right to which is hereby irrevocably transferred and
assigned by the Rollover Sellers to Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries to
subscribe for equity interests in the Purchaser Designee pursuant to the
LLC Agreement), after taking into account the payments set forth in _Section_
__ _ 2.4.1_ through _Section_ __ _ 2.4.6_, to the Sellers in such amounts in
accordance with the Allocation Certificate in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds and to an account designated in writing to the
Purchaser by the Sellers at least three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing.

 

2.5 _Post-Closing Adjustment_.

 

2.5.1 _Adjustment Statement Preparation_. As soon as practicable, but in any
event not more than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall in good faith prepare and deliver to the Sellers Representative an
adjustment statement setting forth the amount of Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the Accrued Tax Liabilities and Selling
Expenses, in each case, as of the Closing and based on the Closing
Indebtedness, the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Cash, the Accrued Tax
Liabilities and the Selling Expenses as derived therefrom, the Purchasers
written calculation of the Transaction Consideration and adjustment necessary
to reconcile the Estimated Transaction Consideration to the Transaction
Consideration (the "Preliminary Adjustment Statement"). The Preliminary
Adjustment Statement shall be prepared as of 12:01 a.m. ET on the Closing
Date, in a manner consistent with _Schedule 2.3_ , including the types of
adjustments set forth therein, and in accordance with the definitions of
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash, Accrued Tax
Liabilities and Selling Expenses as defined in this Agreement. For purposes of
complying with

 



5

    

 the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, each Party shall cooperate
with and make available to the Purchaser or the Sellers Representative, as
applicable, their respective Representatives, and the Accounting Referee all
information, records, data and working papers, and shall permit access to its
facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement and the
resolution of any disputes thereunder; _provided_ , that access to outside
accountants work product shall be subject to the Sellers Representative and
its Representatives executing a reasonable and customary nonreliance letter.

2.5.2 _Adjustment Statement Review_. If the Sellers Representative
reasonably believes that the Preliminary Adjustment Statement is inaccurate
or was not properly prepared in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5.1_, the
Sellers Representative shall so notify the Purchaser no later than
thirty (30) days after the Sellers Representatives receipt thereof (the
"Notice of Disagreement"), setting forth in the Notice of Disagreement its
objections to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement with particularity and the
specific changes that the Sellers Representative proposes to be made in order
to conform the Preliminary Adjustment Statement to the terms of _Section_ __ _
2.5.1_.

 

2.5.3 _Adjustment Statement Dispute Resolution_. If the Sellers
Representative timely notifies the Purchaser of an objection by the Sellers
Representative to the Preliminary Adjustment Statement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.5.2_, and if the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser
are unable to resolve such dispute through good faith negotiations within
thirty (30) days after the Sellers Representatives delivery of such Notice
of Disagreement, then either the Sellers Representative or the Purchaser may
require that the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser mutually engage
and submit such dispute to, and the same shall be finally resolved in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by, Ernst and Young LLP, or, if
such firm declines the representation, an internationally recognized
accounting firm mutually agreed to by the Sellers Representative and the
Purchaser (the accounting firm ultimately chosen, the "Accounting Referee").
The Sellers Representative and the Purchaser will cooperate with the
Accounting Referee in good faith and in all reasonable respects as may be
requested by the Accounting Referee, including providing the Accounting
Referee reasonable access during normal business hours and on reasonable
advance notice to any relevant personnel, properties, and books and records
of the Acquired Entities. The Sellers Representative and the Purchaser will
cause the Accounting Referee to limit its review and determination to those
items set forth on the Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute and that
relate to accounting matters, and to deliver a written report containing its
calculations of each such disputed item. The final determination of the
Accounting Referee will be made in strict accordance with the terms of this
Agreement (including the definitions of Closing Working Capital, Closing Cash,
Closing Indebtedness, Selling Expenses and Accrued Tax Liabilities). The
Accounting Referee will determine the items in dispute solely based
on written submissions made by the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser
(and their respective Representatives) consistent with the terms hereof (and
not by independent review). The Accounting Referee shall determine and report
in writing to the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser as to the
resolution of all disputed matters and the effect of such determinations on
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement within thirty (30) days after such
submission or such longer period as the Accounting Referee may reasonably
require, and such determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Parties, absent manifest error, and upon which a judgment may be entered by a
court of competent jurisdiction. None of the Sellers Representative, the
Purchaser or their respective Representatives will have any ex parte
communications or meetings with the

 



6

    

 Accounting Referee concerning the subject matter hereof without the prior
written consent of the other Party. The Accounting Referee will not assign a
value to any disputed item that is greater than the greater value for such
disputed item claimed by either Party in its written submission or less than
the lesser value for such item claimed by either Party in its written
submission. The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Referee shall be
borne by the Parties (i.e., the Sellers Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers), on the one hand, or the Purchaser, on the other hand)
proportionately, based on the amount assigned by each Party to items in
dispute, on a net basis, relative to the amount finally determined by the
Accounting Referee (or equally in the event the Parties assigned amounts
were, on a net basis, equally far from the amount finally determined by the
Accounting Referee).

 

2.5.4 _Final Adjustment Statement_. The Preliminary Adjustment Statement shall
become the "Final Adjustment Statement" and as such shall become final,
binding and conclusive on the Parties pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_
for all purposes of this Agreement and upon which a judgment may be entered by
a court of competent jurisdiction, upon the earliest to occur of the
following:

(a) the mutual acceptance by the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser of
the Preliminary Adjustment Statement, with such changes thereto, if any, as
may be proposed by the Sellers Representative and consented to by the
Purchaser;

 

(b) the expiration of the time period ending thirty (30) days after the
Sellers Representatives receipt of the Preliminary Adjustment Statement,
without timely written objection by the Sellers Representative in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.5.2_; or

 

(c) the delivery to the Sellers Representative and the Purchaser by the
Accounting Referee of the final report of its determination of all disputed
matters submitted to the Accounting Referee pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.5.3_.

2.5.5 _Adjustment of Transaction Consideration_.

(a) If the Transaction Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, is greater than the Estimated Transaction
Consideration, the Purchaser shall pay the amount of such difference to the
Sellers in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in the manner
in which the Sellers were paid at Closing; _provided_ , that for any such
difference allocated with respect to the Transaction Consideration with
respect to the sale and purchase of LTCO (following the Allocation
Percentage), the associated Taiwan STT shall be deducted therefrom and paid
by the Purchaser to the Taiwan Tax Authority. Any such amount shall be due and
payable no later than three (3) Business Days after the Preliminary Adjustment
Statement becomes the Final Adjustment Statement.

 

(b) If the Transaction Consideration, as finally determined in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, is less than the Estimated Transaction
Consideration, then the Parties shall direct the Escrow Agent to distribute to
the Purchaser from the Working Capital Escrow Account an amount equal to such
deficiency, and if the deficiency exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Amount,
from the Escrow Account. Any such amount shall be due and payable no later
than three (3) Business Days after the Preliminary Adjustment Statement
becomes the

 



7

    

 Final Adjustment Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Working Capital
Escrow Amount and Escrow Amount shall be the sole source of recovery of the
Purchaser for any obligation arising under this _Section_ __ _ 2.5.5_. The
Parties agree that the Purchaser shall have no obligation to obtain, remit to
or reimburse Sellers for any amount of the Estimated Taiwan STT that has been
paid and deducted from the Estimated Taiwan Transaction Consideration in the
event that the Transaction Consideration, as finally determined in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, is less than the Estimated Taiwan Transaction
Consideration; _provided_ , that this sentence shall not be deemed to in any
way limit or restrict Sellers right to seek a refund directly from Taiwanese
Tax authorities in respect thereof in accordance with Section 7.2.

 

(c) For tax purposes, any payment by the Purchaser or the Sellers under this
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Transaction
Consideration, unless otherwise required by Law. The Parties agree to
cooperate to make all necessary filings, notifications or applications to any
applicable Governmental Authority, in each case to the extent required by
applicable Law for such adjustment.

2.6 _Allocation of the Transaction Consideration_. The payment by the
Purchaser of the Transaction Consideration (including any adjustment required
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5_) to the Sellers shall constitute payment by
the Purchaser to the Sellers in full and final satisfaction of the Purchasers
obligation to pay such amount hereunder.

2.7 _The Sellers_ __ _Representative Holdback Amount_. The Sellers
Representative Holdback Amount shall be held by the Sellers Representative
and shall be available to pay, or reimburse the Sellers Representative for,
certain post-closing payments relating to this Agreement as determined or
estimated by the Sellers Representative in its sole discretion. The Sellers
will not receive any interest or earnings on the Sellers Representative
Holdback Amount and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Sellers
Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any
such interest or earnings. The Sellers Representative will not be liable to
any Seller for any loss of principal of the Sellers Representative Holdback
Amount other than as a result of its fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The Sellers Representative will hold these funds separate from
its corporate funds, will not use these funds for any other purposes and will
not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors in the event of
bankruptcy. For tax purposes, the Sellers Representative Holdback Amount
shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set aside by the
Sellers at the time of Closing. Any portion of the Sellers Representative
Holdback Amount not used to pay such amounts shall be distributed at such time
as determined by the Sellers Representative in its reasonable discretion to
the Sellers proportionately (in accordance with the proportion of
the Transaction Consideration (including the Rollover Amount) allocated to
such Seller pursuant to the Allocation Certificate but after taking into
account and excluding such amounts paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.4.1_
through  _Section_ __ _ 2.4.6_).

2.8 _Proceedings_. Except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, all
proceedings that will be taken and all documents that will be executed and
delivered by the Parties on the Closing Date will be deemed to have been taken
and executed simultaneously at 12:01 a.m. ET on the Closing Date, and no
proceedings will be deemed taken nor any document executed and delivered
until all such proceedings have been taken, and all such documents have been
executed and delivered.

 



8

    

2.9 _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Purchaser will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement to any Seller such amounts as
are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any provision of
applicable Law with respect to the making of such payment. Other than
Specified Withholding Taxes, the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the applicable payee with prior notice of the applicability
of any such withholding prior to making such withholding, and shall provide
the Sellers a reasonable opportunity to provide any applicable certificates,
forms or documentation that would reduce or eliminate the requirement to
withhold Tax under the Code or other applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld and paid over to the applicable
Governmental Authority, the Purchaser will provide notice of such withheld and
deducted amounts to the applicable payee, and such deducted and withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Sellers or such other Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding were made.

3.6.3 There are no Actions pending and, to the knowledge of the Sellers, there
has been no proposed or threatened Action, in each case in respect of any
Taxes or Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities. There are not currently in

power and authority, as applicable, and any Permits, consents and approvals
required to acquire, purchase and own and operate its business. The Purchaser
is not in violation of any provision of its Organizational Documents.

5.2  _Authorization; Enforceability_. The Purchasers execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which the
Purchaser is or will be a party, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, are within the Purchasers capacity, power
and authority and have been duly authorized or consented to by all necessary
corporate action on its part (including by any and all action required by
shareholders of the Purchaser and its Affiliates), and no further such
approval or other action is required in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.
The Purchaser has all requisite capacity, power and authority, as the case
may be, to become a party to, and to consummate the transactions contemplated
by, this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which the Purchaser is or
will be a party. This Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which
the Purchaser is or will be required to be a party as contemplated hereby has
been or will be duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser and, once
executed, will constitute a legal, valid and binding agreement of the
Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with their
respective terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors
rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to the
effect of general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is
considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 

5.3 _Non-Contravention; Consents_.

 

5.3.1 Except as disclosed on _Section_ __ _ 5.3.1_ of the Disclosure
Schedules, the execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser of this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which the Purchaser is or will be a
party and ownership of the Securities do not and will not (a) violate the
Organizational Documents of the Purchaser or any of the Purchasers
Subsidiaries or (b) violate any applicable Law or Order, except in the case of
clause (b), to the extent that any such conflict or violation would not
materially impair or delay the Purchasers ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or to perform its obligations hereunder.

 



26

    

5.3.2 Except (a) the application with the Taiwan Investment Commission and (b)
as disclosed on _Section_ __ _ 5.3.2_ of the Disclosure Schedules (the
"Purchaser-driven Laws"), and on the basis that the 2018 revenue of the LTCO
set forth in the Financial Statements and the 2018 revenue and estimated
market share data of the Acquired Entities provided by Sellers to Purchaser
are reasonably and approximately accurate, the execution, delivery and
performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement and each of the Ancillary
Agreements to which the Purchaser is or will be a party do not and will not
require any filing or notification with, or any clearance, authorization,
approval, waiver, or consent from, any Governmental Authority. _Section_ __ _
5.3.2_ of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth, as of the date of this
Agreement, all filings, notifications, clearances, authorizations, approvals,
waivers or consents by or on behalf of the Purchaser, any of the Acquired
Entities, or the Sellers required under the Purchaser-driven Laws as a result
of this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions
described herein.

5.4  _Litigation_. There is no Action pending or, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser, threatened against or affecting the Purchaser or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, and neither the
Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates is subject to or bound by any Order, in
either case that would prevent or otherwise materially interfere with the
ability of the Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement to which the Purchaser is or will be a
party, or to otherwise perform its obligations under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement to which the Purchaser is or will be a party.

 

5.5 _Finders_ __ _Fees_. Except as disclosed on _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ of the
Disclosure Schedules, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates, who is entitled to any fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement. All amounts disclosed on _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ of
the Disclosure Schedules or required to be paid to the investment banker,
broker, finder or other intermediary set forth thereon shall be paid by the
Purchaser.

5.6 _Investment Intent_. The Purchaser is acquiring the Securities for its own
account for investment purposes only and not with a view to any public
distribution thereof or with any intention of selling, distributing or
otherwise disposing of the Securities in a manner that would violate the
registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities Laws.
The Purchaser does not have any contract, undertaking or agreement with any
non-Subsidiary Person to sell, transfer or grant participations with respect
to the Securities. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Securities may not be
sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and any applicable
state securities Laws, except pursuant to an exemption from such registration
under the Securities Act and such state securities Laws. The Purchaser is able
to bear the economic risk of holding the Securities for an indefinite period
of time (including total loss of its investment), and has sufficient
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as to be capable
of evaluating the merits and risk of its investment.

 

5.7 _Sufficiency of Funds_. The Purchaser has delivered to the Sellers a true
and complete copy of a duly executed commitment letter among the Purchaser
and EnPro Holdings, Inc., Bank of America, N.A. (the "Financing Source") and
BofA Securities, Inc. (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and
amendments thereto, collectively the "Commitment Letter") pursuant to which
the Financing Source has committed to provide the Purchaser with a loan in the

 



27

    

 amount described therein, the proceeds of which shall be used, among other
things and together with other funds as described herein below, on the Closing
Date, to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Financing") and the fully executed fee letter relating thereto (the "Fee
Letter"); _provided_ , that such fee letter may be redacted to remove fee
amounts, the economic portion of any market "flex" provisions, pricing caps
and other economics terms set forth therein, none of which affect the
availability or amount of the Financing. Such Commitment Letter is in full
force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Purchaser and, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, each of the other
parties thereto, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
moratorium, reorganization and similar Laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally and the availability of equitable remedies (whether in a proceeding
in equity or at law). The aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, together with available cash on hand of the Purchaser and to be
drawn under the Purchasers credit facility, shall be sufficient to enable
the Purchaser to pay the Transaction Consideration and consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Commitment Letter has not
been amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified after delivery
thereof to the Sellers and prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. As of the date hereof, neither the Purchaser nor any Affiliate of
the Purchaser has entered into any agreement, side letter or arrangement
relating to the financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
other than as set forth in the Commitment Letter or in the Fee Letter. The
Purchaser has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees
and other amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with the Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof, no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach, default or event of default on the part of the Purchaser
or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, any other party under, or a basis for
termination by any party thereto of, the Commitment Letter. As of the date
hereof, assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section_ __ _
8.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ of this Agreement, the Purchaser has no
knowledge that, and has not been informed that, any other party thereto will
be unable to satisfy on a timely basis the obligation to provide the
Financing pursuant to the Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent
related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than the
conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter. 

5.8 _Solvency_. The Purchaser and its Subsidiaries designated to hold the
Securities (a) are able to pay their respective debts as they become due, (b)
own assets that have a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required
to pay their probable liabilities (including a reasonable estimate of the
probable amounts of all contingent liabilities), and (c) have adequate
capital to carry on their business. Immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and the incurrence of any indebtedness by the
Purchaser or an Affiliate thereof in connection herewith, and assuming the
accuracy in all material respects of the representations and warranties of
the Sellers hereunder (excluding any qualification as to materiality or
"Material Adverse Effect" included therein) and compliance in all material
respects by the Sellers with their covenants, obligations and agreements
hereunder, the Purchaser, its Subsidiaries designated to hold the Securities
and the Acquired Entities (i) shall be able to pay their debts as they become
due, (ii) shall own assets that have a fair saleable value greater than the
amounts required to pay their probable liabilities (including a reasonable
estimate of the probable amounts of all contingent liabilities), and (iii)
shall have reasonably adequate capital to carry on their business. No
transfer of property is being made, and no obligation is being incurred, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, with the intent to hinder, delay or 

 



28

    

 defraud either present or future creditors of the Purchaser or any
Subsidiary of the Purchaser, including, from and after the Closing, any
Acquired Entity. In connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, the Purchaser has not incurred, and
does not plan to incur, debts beyond the Purchasers ability to pay them as
they become absolute and matured.

 

5.9 _The Purchaser_ __ _s Investigation and Reliance_. The Purchaser is a
sophisticated purchaser and has made its own investigation, review and
analysis regarding the Acquired Entities, the Sellers and the transactions
contemplated hereby, together with the Representatives that it has engaged for
such purpose. The Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, in making
its decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Ancillary Agreements
to which it is specified to be a party and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, it is not relying, and has not relied, upon
any statement, representation or warranty, oral or written, express or
implied, made by the Sellers, any of the Acquired Entities or any of their
respective Representatives, except as expressly set forth in _Article III_ ,
_Article IV_ and the Disclosure Schedules, and subject to the limitations
contained in this Agreement, including, without limitation, the limitations
contained in _Article IX_ hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, none of the
Sellers, any of the Acquired Entities or any of their respective
Representatives or Affiliates is making, directly or indirectly, any
representation or warranty with respect to any information in the Confidential
Information Presentation, or any estimates, projections or forecasts involving
the Acquired Entities, including those contained therein. The Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that there are inherent uncertainties in attempting to
make such estimates, projections and forecasts and that it takes full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of
any such estimates, projections or forecasts (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying any such estimates, projections or forecasts). The
Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives, agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, that none of the Seller, the Acquired Entities or their
respective Affiliates or Representatives will have or be subject to
any liability on any basis (including in contract or tort, under federal or
state securities Laws or otherwise) to the Purchaser, any Affiliate of the
Purchaser or their respective Representatives based upon any information
provided or made available, or statements made, to the Purchaser, any
Affiliates of the Purchaser or any of their respective Representatives (or any
omissions therefrom), other than the representations and warranties expressly
set forth in in _Articles III_ or _IV_  of this Agreement. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_ is intended to modify or limit any of the representations
or warranties of the Sellers set forth in _Articles III_ and _IV_.

 

5.10 _Non-PRC Person_. As of the date hereof, the Purchaser is not a "PRC
Person" (as such term is defined in the Taiwan Act Governing Relations
between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area and the
regulations promulgated thereunder), and no funding in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be obtained by the Purchaser
from any "PRC Person" or "PRC Individual" (as each such term is defined in the
Taiwan Act Governing Relations between the Peoples of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area and the regulations promulgated thereunder).

 



29

    

ARTICLE VI

 

 _CERTAIN COVENANTS_

 

6.1 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
Party to this Agreement, the other Parties will execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, all such documents, instruments, conveyances and
assurances and will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions, as the requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in any such
case, at the requesting Partys sole cost and expense unless otherwise
provided herein.

 

6.2 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. From the Closing through the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing (and continuing thereafter with
respect to any proceeding or claim asserted or brought on or prior to such
anniversary), the Purchaser shall cause the Acquired Entities and any
successors, assigns or other subsequent continuing and surviving entities to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under
the Organizational Documents governing the Acquired Entities, each person who
was or is made a party or threatened to be made a party to or is involved in
any proceeding by reason of the fact that such person is, or was at any time
prior to the Closing, a director, officer, manager, partner, member or senior
employee (each, a "DandO") of any of the Acquired Entities (each, a
"Company Indemnified Person"), against all Damages incurred or suffered by
such Company Indemnified Person in connection therewith, whether claimed prior
to, at or after the Closing. The Organizational Documents of each of the
Acquired Entities shall contain, and the Purchaser shall cause the
Organizational Documents of each of the Acquired Entities to continue to so
contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former DandOs of any of
the Acquired Entities than are set forth in the Organizational Documents of
such Acquired Entity as of the date of this Agreement. If an Acquired Entity
or any of its successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges with or
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity,
partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (b) transfers
or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of such Acquired Entity assume the obligations
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.2_.

 

6.3 _Conduct of Business of the_ _Acquired Entities_. During the period from
the date of this Agreement through the Closing, each of the Acquired Entities
will, and the Sellers will cause each of the Acquired Entities to, (a) conduct
its operations in the Ordinary Course, (b) use commercially reasonable efforts
to maintain and preserve intact the current organization, business, Permits
and franchise of the Acquired Entities and to preserve the rights, franchises,
goodwill and relationships of its employees, customers, lenders, suppliers,
regulators and others having business relationships with the
Acquired Entities, and (c) not make, revoke or modify any tax allocation,
change any tax accounting method, commence, settle, or compromise any Tax
Action, or file any amended Tax Return or claim for refund. From the date of
this Agreement through the Closing, except, in each case, as (i) otherwise
expressly provided herein or as required by applicable Law, (ii) consented to
in writing by the Purchaser or (iii) set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ of the
Disclosure Schedules, the Sellers shall cause the Acquired Entities not to
take any action that would cause any of the changes, events or conditions
described in _Section_ __ _ 3.7_ to occur or adopt or implement any new
employee benefit plans or change any employee compensation and benefits.

 



30

    

6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Regulatory Filings_.

 

6.4.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, from the date of
this Agreement to the Closing, or the earlier termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1_, each of the Parties shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to file,
or cause to be filed, all documents, to give, or cause to be given,
all notices under applicable Laws, to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all
authorizations, consents, waivers, approvals, permits or orders under
applicable Laws or from other Persons, and to do, or cause to be done, all
other things necessary, proper or advisable, in order to consummate and make
effective as promptly as possible the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.4.1_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement shall require, and in no event shall the "reasonable best
efforts" of Purchaser be deemed or construed to require, Purchaser to (a)
bring any Action against the Financing Source or any alternative financing
sources to enforce its respective rights under the Commitment Letter or any
agreements with such alternative financing sources, or (b) seek or accept
Financing or alternative financing on terms materially less favorable than
the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter.

6.4.2 Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Parties
shall cause to be filed with the appropriate Governmental Authority (a) as
promptly as practicable following the date hereof any required filings and
approvals with the Taiwan Investment Commission and (b) as promptly as
practicable following the date hereof all information and materials required
to be filed under any Purchaser-driven Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Regulatory Filings"). Subject to
applicable Law and reasonable confidentiality considerations, the Parties
shall collaborate with each other in the preparation and submission of the
Regulatory Filings. The Purchaser shall pay all administrative filing fees
(but, for the avoidance of doubt, not costs of preparation or review of such
filings for the Sellers) associated with the Regulatory Filings.

6.4.3 The Parties shall respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries
or requests received from a Governmental Authority for additional information
or documentary material relating to the Regulatory Filings. Each Party shall
(a) promptly inform the other party of any communication to or from any
Governmental Authority regarding the Regulatory Filings or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) give the other party prompt notice of the
commencement of any investigation or legal proceeding by or before any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Regulatory Filings or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (c) keep the other party informed as to
the status of any such investigation or legal proceeding. To the
extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party shall provide to the other
Parties in advance with a reasonable opportunity for review and comment,
drafts of communications to be submitted to a Governmental Authority in
connection with the Regulatory Filings or relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and shall consider in good faith each others comments on
those drafts. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Party shall give
the other Parties advance notice of any meeting or conference with a
Governmental Authority relating to the Regulatory Filings or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be prohibited by a Governmental
Authority, shall permit authorized Representatives of the other Parties to be
present at those meetings or conferences.

 



31

    

6.4.4 The Purchaser and the Sellers may, as they deem advisable and necessary,
designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other in
connection with the Regulatory Filings as "outside counsel only." Any
materials or information so designated shall be given only to outside counsel
of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without the advance written
consent of the party providing such materials.

 

6.4.5 Each Party shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions necessary to effectuate as promptly as practicable the
Closing and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Party shall use reasonable best
efforts (a) to obtain all consents, authorizations, approvals, waivers
or clearances required from a Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Regulatory Filings)
and, in the case of the Sellers, of other third parties whose consent or other
action would be necessary to cause the representations set forth in _Section_
__ _ 3.3.1_ (without giving effect to the Disclosure Schedules in respect
thereof) to be true and correct, and (b) to prevent, avoid or lift any
restraint, prohibition, injunction, delay, limitation, or other legal bar to
the Closing and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4.5_, "reasonable best efforts" shall mean
the obligation (i) to use reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections,
if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) if any administrative or judicial
Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the
transactions contemplated hereby, and if the Sellers or the Purchaser decide
that litigation is in their best interests, to cooperate and use reasonable
best efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any order that is in
effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , in each case, that such
efforts will not require the expenditure by Purchaser of more than $500,000
(inclusive of attorneys fees) in connection therewith. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Purchaser shall not be required by this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.4_ to take or agree to undertake any action, including
entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or other arrangement,
that would (x) require the divestiture of any assets of the Purchaser,
any Acquired Entity or any of their respective Affiliates, (y) limit the
Purchasers freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate
and control, the Acquired Entities or any of their assets or businesses (other
than customary covenants as required by the Taiwan Investment Commission that
would not reasonably be expected to be material to LTCO) or any of the
Purchasers or its Affiliates other assets or businesses or (z) limit the
Purchasers ability to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership
with respect to, the Securities other than would reasonably be expected to
result in a Liability or loss of Purchaser or the Acquired Entities in an
amount not exceeding $500,000.

 

6.5 _Leased Real Property_. Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver a customary subordination and nondisturbance agreement
with any lender holding an encumbrance superior to any U.S. Real Property
Lease, whereby such lender agrees to recognize the tenants rights under such
Real Property Lease so long as such tenant is not in default under the terms
of such lease.

 



32

    

6.6 _Update of Disclosure Schedules_. The Sellers shall have the right (but
not the obligation) from time to time prior to the Closing to supplement,
modify or amend information set forth on the Disclosure Schedules (each, a
"Schedule Update") solely in respect of any matter arising after the date
hereof (other than any matter arising as a result of a breach by any Seller
or any Acquired Entity of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement) that,
if existing or occurring at or prior to the date of this Agreement, would
individually result in a breach (a "New Breach") of any representation or
warranty of the Sellers contained in _Article III_ (other than a Fundamental
Representation or breach of clause (a) of the first sentence of _Section_ __ _
3.7_). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the
event that such New Breach is not fully cured before the earlier of (a) thirty
(30) days following the delivery by the Sellers of a Schedule Update and (b)
the Termination Date, unless the Purchaser notifies the Sellers of its intent
to terminate this Agreement within two (2) Business Days after such earlier
date (and without regard to Purchasers right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.1.1(b))_, such Schedule Update shall be
deemed to have cured the corresponding New Breach for purposes of such
condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.1.1_ (and the Purchaser will not
thereafter be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.1.1(b)_ solely as a result of such New Breach), but shall not be deemed to
have cured any such New Breach for purposes of _Article VII_ or _Article IX_.

6.7 _Employees and Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

6.7.1 For at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, the Purchaser
shall provide or cause to be provided to each employee of the Acquired
Entities who continues in employment following the Closing Date (collectively,
the "Continuing Employees") (i) a rate of base salary, wages and annual cash
incentive bonus opportunity that is at least comparable in the aggregate to
the rate of base salary, wages and annual cash incentive bonus opportunity
paid by the applicable Acquired Entity to such Continuing Employee immediately
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) other benefits (excluding to the
extent permitted by applicable Law equity or equity-based compensation,
defined benefit pension or severance benefits) that are no less favorable than
the benefits (not including equity or equity-based compensation, defined
benefit pension or severance benefits) provided by the Purchaser to its other
employees holding positions with similar level of responsibility within the
same country.

 

6.7.2 Following the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure, or cause to ensure, that no limitations or
exclusions as to preexisting conditions, evidence of insurability or good
health, waiting periods or actively-at-work exclusions or other limitations
or restrictions on coverage are applicable to any Continuing Employees or
their dependents or beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans in which
such Continuing Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries may be eligible
to participate following the Closing Date, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable plans of the Acquired Entities in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing Date. For the plan
year that includes the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to provide or cause to be provided that any costs or
expenses incurred by Continuing Employees (and their dependents or
beneficiaries) up to (and including) the Closing Date shall be taken
into account for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, co-payment,
coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket provisions and like adjustments or
limitations on coverage under any such welfare benefit plans.

 



33

    

6.7.3 With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy or practice,
including vacation and paid time off plans, policies or practices, sponsored
or maintained by the Purchaser or its Affiliates (including any of the
Acquired Entities following the Closing), the Purchaser shall grant, or cause
to be granted, to all Continuing Employees from and after the Closing Date
credit for all service with the Acquired Entities and its predecessors (other
than benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans or severance plans
to the extent permitted by applicable Law) prior to the Closing Date for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting credit, and eligibility to
commence benefits and with respect to paid time off benefits only for benefit
accrual, but excluding any such credit that would result in a duplication
of benefits.

6.7.4 The Purchaser shall establish a retention program (the "Retention
Program") in the aggregate amount of $1,000,000 for the nine (9) key managers
of the Acquired Entities as of the Closing Date to be allocated to such key
managers in amounts as determined by Mr. King Koo ("Mr. Koo") after
consultation with the Purchaser for payment of allocated amounts on the first
and second anniversary of the Closing, with each payment being subject to the
continued employment in good standing of the applicable employee in compliance
with the Retention Program. Any amount allocated but not earned by the
applicable employee will revert to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall have
no obligation to reallocate or distribute such unearned amount to any other
Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that there are
unallocated or unearned amounts available under the Retention Program, Mr.
Koo, with the approval of the Purchaser, may request that such amounts be used
to award signing bonuses to recruit new employees to replace any
terminated employee and/or otherwise support the activities of the key
managers.

6.7.5 The Purchaser shall establish a cash pool (the "Cash Pool") in the
aggregate amount of $250,000 to be allocated to the Acquired Entities
employees not participating in the Retention Program, at Mr. Koos discretion
in consultation with Purchaser to be paid after Closing to encourage
retention and incentivize these employees, with the structure of payments
therefrom to be recommended by Mr. Koo.

6.7.6 Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring any of the
Acquired Entities to continue any specific plans or to continue the employment
of any Continuing Employee. This _Section_ __ _ 6.7_ shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each of the Parties in their capacity as
Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, express
or implied, shall confer upon any other Person (including employees of the
Acquired Entities) any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or
by reason of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_. Nothing contained herein, express or
implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement.

6.7.7 Prior to the Closing, the Optionholder and LTCO, respectively, shall
take all actions necessary to complete the exercise of the Option, obtain all
necessary approvals of any applicable Governmental Authority and issue the
shares of capital stock of LTCO issuable pursuant thereto, in accordance with
applicable Law.

 

6.8 _Preservation of Records_. After the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall,
and shall cause the Acquired Entities to, until the seventh (7th) anniversary
of the Closing Date, retain all books, records and other documents pertaining
to the business of the Acquired Entities in existence on the Closing Date and,
in connection with any pending or threatened Tax Action involving any Seller
or the Optionholder (and, for the avoidance of doubt, not in connection with
any Action

 



34

    

 between any Seller and Purchaser any of its Subsidiaries), make such
information as is reasonably necessary to address such Tax Action the same
available upon reasonable advance notice, for inspection and copying by the
Sellers Representative during normal business hours of the Acquired Entities,
as applicable; _provided_ , that if the Purchaser shall desire to dispose of
any of such books or records prior to the expiration of such seven (7) year
period, the Purchaser shall, prior to such disposition, give the Sellers
Representative a reasonable opportunity, at its own expense, to segregate and
remove such books and records as the Sellers Representative may select
subject to confidentiality obligations for such seven (7) year period.

6.9 _Access to Information_  

6.9.1 Prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall be entitled, through its
officers, employees and Representatives, to reasonable access during normal
business hours to the Key Seller Individuals and offices of each Acquired
Entity and their respective books and records, and the Sellers shall cause the
Acquired Entities to furnish the Purchaser with such financial, operating and
other data and information as the Purchaser may reasonably request, including
for purpose of the Purchasers or its Affiliates compliance with their
respective reporting requirements under the United States Securities Exchange
Act of 1934; _provided_ , _however_ , that such access shall be subject to
any applicable Laws relating to privacy or data protection and shall only be
upon reasonable advance written notice, shall not unreasonably disrupt
personnel, operations and properties of the Acquired Entities, and shall be
at the Purchasers sole risk and expense.

6.9.2 On the Closing Date, the Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered
to the Purchaser all original (and any and all copies of) agreements,
documents, books and records, files and other information, and all computer
disks, records, tapes and any other storage medium on which any such
agreements, documents, books and records, files and other information is
stored, in any such case, relating to the business and operations of the
Acquired Entities, that are not in the full possession of or under the full
control of an Acquired Entity, but that are in the possession of or under the
control of the Sellers or any Affiliates thereof.

6.10  _Confid_ _entiality_.

6.10.1 For a period of eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date, each
of the Sellers shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates and
Representatives not to, use for its or their own benefit (or for the benefit
of any Person other than Purchaser and its Subsidiaries) or divulge or convey
to any third party any Confidential Information, and to handle the
Confidential Information with the same degree of care which such Seller
applies to its own confidential information (but in no event less than
reasonable care); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers, or their
respective Affiliates and Representatives may furnish such portion of the
Confidential Information as such Person reasonably determines it is required
to disclose (i) if it receives a request to disclose all or any part of the
Confidential Information under the terms of a subpoena, civil investigative
demand or Order, (ii) if such disclosure is requested to be made in any legal,
administrative, regulatory or arbitral process or proceeding, including in
connection with any Tax audit involving such Person or in any Tax Return, or
(iii) in connection with the enforcement or defense of any right, remedy or
claim relating to this Agreement (including Third Party Claims); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in respect of any disclosure pursuant to subparts (i) or
(ii) above, to the extent reasonably practical, the applicable party shall
notify the Purchaser of the existence, terms and

 



35

    

 circumstances surrounding such request and it shall reasonably cooperate
with the Purchaser, at the Purchasers expense, in the Purchasers efforts to
obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded to the disclosed Confidential Information. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Confidential Information" consists of confidential proprietary
information relating to the business of the Acquired Entities or the
transactions contemplated hereby, except for data or information that is or
becomes available to the public (other than as a result of a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 6.10.1_). The foregoing covenant in respect of Confidential
Information shall not supersede or replace any agreements or obligations in
respect of Confidential Information with any Seller (in any capacity other
than solely as a Seller) or Key Seller Individual entered into with Purchaser
or any Acquired Entity, including pursuant to a Mandate Agreement or
Consulting Agreement.

6.10.2 Effective as of the Closing, if and to the extent any such
confidentiality agreements exist and are effective, each of the Sellers hereby
assigns to the Purchaser all of such Sellers right, title and interest in and
to any confidentiality agreements entered into by any of the Sellers (or its
Affiliates or Representatives) and each Person (other than the Purchaser and
its Affiliates and Representatives) who entered into any such agreement, or to
whom Confidential Information was provided, in connection with a
business combination involving any Acquired Entity or its Affiliates. For a
period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, if requested by the
Purchaser, the Sellers will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with the Purchaser in order to assist in enforcing the rights (if any) so
assigned. Each of the Sellers shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such Person to return to the Sellers prior to the Closing any
documents, files, data or other materials constituting Confidential
Information that was provided to such Person in connection with the
consideration of any such business combination.

 

6.11 _Exclusive Dealing_. From the date hereof through the earlier of the
Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
_Section 10.1_, each of the Sellers agrees that, except as otherwise
expressly set forth herein, it will not, it will cause its Affiliates and the
Acquired Entities not to and it will direct its officers, managers, members
and advisors not to, directly or indirectly, without the Purchasers prior
written consent, enter into, initiate or hold discussions with, or provide any
nonpublic information to, any Person (other than the Purchaser) regarding any
disposition or purchase of any equity interest in, any equity investment in
or any sale of all or any significant part of the assets or business of the
Acquired Entities, or any merger, reorganization, recapitalization,
consolidation, share exchange or other business combination or disposition
involving the Acquired Entities (any offers or inquiries pertaining to any of
the foregoing matters are referred to as an "Acquisition Transaction
Proposal"). Upon the execution of this Agreement, each of the Sellers shall,
and shall cause the Acquired Entities to, immediately terminate any and all
discussions, negotiations and other communications with any third party
relating to any Acquisition Transaction Proposal, terminate access of
any such third party to the virtual data room and to any other nonpublic
information of or relating to the Acquired Entities in connection with such
Acquisition Transaction Proposal, and request that all third parties that have
received such nonpublic information return and/or destroy such information in
accordance with the applicable confidentiality agreement.

6.12 _Release and Discharge_

 

6.12.1 Effective as of and contingent upon the Closing, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, each of the Sellers, on the one hand, and the
Acquired Entities, on the other hand, in each case on behalf of itself and on
behalf of its shareholders, members or Affiliates, as applicable, assigns and
beneficiaries and, to the extent acting in a representative capacity,
its creditors, directors, officers, managers, employees, investors,
Representatives, successors and assigns of any of them (collectively, the
"Releasing Persons"), hereby knowingly, voluntarily, unconditionally and
irrevocably waives, fully and finally releases, acquits and forever
discharges each of the Acquired Entities (in the case of each of the Sellers)
and each of the Sellers (in the case of the Acquired Entities) and their
assigns and beneficiaries, creditors, directors, officers, managers,

any of them (collectively, the "Released Persons") from any and all actions,
causes of action, suits, debts, accounts, bonds, bills, covenants, contracts,
controversies, obligations, claims, counterclaims, debts, demands, damages,
costs, expenses, compensation or Liabilities of every kind and any nature
whatsoever, in each case whether absolute or contingent, liquidated
or unliquidated, known or unknown, direct or derivative on behalf of any
Person, and whether arising under any agreement or understanding or otherwise
at Law or equity ("Released Claims"), which such Releasing Persons, or any of
them, had, has, or may have had arising from, connected or related to, or
caused by any event, occurrence, cause or thing, of any type whatsoever, or
otherwise, arising or existing, or occurring, in whole or in part, at any time
in the past until and including the Closing against any of the Released
Persons (the "Release"). The Release shall be effective as a full, final and
irrevocable accord and satisfaction and release of all of the Released Claims.

 

6.12.2 Effective as of and contingent upon the Closing, each of the Sellers
and the Acquired Entities hereby irrevocably and unconditionally covenants to
refrain from, directly or indirectly, asserting any claim or demand, or
commencing, instituting or causing to be commenced, any proceeding of any kind
against any Released Person, based upon the Release or to seek to recover any
amounts in connection therewith or thereunder from and after the Closing. Any
Released Person may plead this Release as a complete bar to any Released
Claims brought in derogation of this covenant not to sue.

 

6.12.3 Each of the Sellers and the Acquired Entities agrees that if it or any
of its Affiliates violates any provision of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.12_, such
Sellers or Acquired Entity will pay the costs and expenses of defending
against any related or resulting Actions incurred by the Released Persons,
including attorneys fees.

 

6.12.4 For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.12_ shall not be deemed to apply to any (i) claim against the Acquired
Entities by any individual who is a former or current DandO thereof, to the
extent such claim arises out of such individuals service as DandO pursuant to
any indemnification agreement between such individual and the Acquired
Entities or the applicable provisions of its Organizational Documents, (ii)
claim against the Purchaser or any Seller pursuant to _Article IX_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, (iii) any obligations of any Seller pursuant to this
Agreement, including a release of any claim which may be made arising from or
in connection with this Agreement, or (iv) any claim of fraud.

 

6.12.5 Each of the Sellers and the Acquired Entities expressly acknowledges
that it has had, or has had and waived, the opportunity to be advised by
independent legal counsel and hereby waives and relinquishes all rights and
benefits afforded by, and does so understanding and acknowledging the
significance and consequence of such specific waiver of, any applicable Law
similar in nature to Section 1542 of the California Civil Code, which
provides:

 



37

    

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR
SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF
KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.

 

6.13 _Intercompany Arrangements_ ___and Related Party Contracts_. Except as
set forth on _Section 6.13_ of the Disclosure Schedules, the Sellers shall
cause all Related Party Contracts to be terminated in accordance with their
terms, immediately prior to the Closing, following which time no Related Party
Contract shall provide for any further liability to any party.

6.14 _Financing Information_. Until the earlier to occur of the termination of
this Agreement and the Closing, the Sellers shall cause the Acquired Entities
and their respective Representatives to, at Purchasers sole expense, provide
such information regarding the Acquired Entities and Sellers in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser. Until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement and
the Closing, the Sellers shall cause the Acquired Entities and their
respective Representatives to, at the Purchasers sole expense, reasonably
cooperate in connection with the Financing as may be reasonably requested by
the Purchaser.

ARTICLE VII

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

The following provisions of this _Article VII_ shall govern the allocation
between the Purchaser and the Sellers of responsibility for certain Tax
matters involving the Acquired Entities following the Closing Date. In the
event of any conflict between the provisions of this _Article VII_ and any
other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this _Article VII_ shall
control.

 

7.1 _Preparation of Tax Returns; Control of Audits; Tax Refunds_.

 

7.1.1 Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1.2_, the Purchaser shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, for filing by the Acquired Entities all Tax
Returns for the Acquired Entities for any (a) Tax period ending on or before
the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Periods"), and (b) Straddle Period that
are due after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement and the Acquired Entities
past practices, except to the extent required otherwise by applicable Law. The
Sellers will timely pay (or cause to be timely paid) all Pre-Closing Tax
Liabilities (as such term is defined herein) shown as due and owing on all
such Tax Returns, other than to the extent that such liability is included
in Accrued Tax Liabilities that results in an actual reduction in Transaction
Consideration. Except as expressly contemplated in this _Article VII_ , under
no circumstances shall the Purchaser or the Acquired Entities amend any Tax
Returns for Pre-Closing Periods without the prior written consent of the
Sellers Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). For the avoidance of doubt, without the
prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, neither the Purchaser nor
any

 



38

    

 of the Acquired Entities shall make or change any election or change any
annual accounting period in each case with an effective date on or before the
Closing Date, if such action would have the effect of increasing the present
or future liability or obligation of the Sellers to indemnify the Purchaser
with respect to Taxes pursuant to the provisions hereof.

 

7.1.2 The Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared for filing by LTLLC
all income Tax Returns for LTLLC for all Pre-Closing Periods that are due
after the Closing Date and that contain items of income, deductions, credits,
gains or losses are passed through to the holders of Securities in LTLLC
Company Units under applicable Law _._ Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with the terms of this Agreement and LTLLCs past
practices, except to the extent required otherwise by applicable Law. The
Sellers will timely pay (or cause to be timely paid) all Pre-Closing Tax
Liabilities (as such term is defined herein), if any, shown as due and owing
on all such Tax Returns for which the Sellers are liable under _Section_ __ _
7.3_ of this Agreement.

7.1.3 Any Tax Returns prepared by the Purchaser pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1.1_ (but only to the extent that the Sellers are liable for Taxes
reflected on such Tax Returns) or by the Sellers pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1.2_ (including, in each case, any related work papers or other information
reasonably requested by the other party) shall be provided to the other Party
for review not later than twenty (20) Business Days (or, in the case of any
such Tax Return that is not an income Tax Return, seven (7) Business Days)
before the due date for filing such Tax Returns (including extensions);
_provided_ , that if the filing date is less than twenty (20) Business Days
after the Closing Date (taking into account any applicable extensions of time
to file without penalty or addition to Tax) (or, in the case of any Tax
Return that is not an income Tax Return, seven (7) Business Days), the Party
responsible for the preparation of such Tax Return shall deliver such
documents to the other Party as promptly as possible. The Party responsible
for the preparation of the Tax Return referred to in _Section_ __ _ 7.1.1_ or
_7.1.2_ shall be the "Preparing Party" and the Party entitled to review rights
pursuant to such section shall be the "Reviewing Party." If the Reviewing
Party does not provide the Preparing Party with a written description of the
items in the Tax Returns or the tax statement that the Reviewing Party intends
to dispute within ten (10) Business Days following the delivery to the
Reviewing Party of such documents, the Reviewing Party shall be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to such documents in the form provided, and shall
thereafter be filed by the Acquired Entities. The Sellers Representative and
the Purchaser agree to timely consult with each other and to negotiate in good
faith any timely raised issue arising as a result of the review of such Tax
Returns to permit the filing of such Tax Returns as promptly as possible. In
the event the Parties are unable to resolve any dispute, the Sellers
Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly request the Accounting Referee
to resolve any issue in dispute before the due date of such Tax Return, in
order that such Tax Return may be timely filed. The Accounting Referee shall
make a determination with respect to any disputed issue and the Purchaser
shall cause the Acquired Entities to file such Tax Return (including
extensions) therefor in a manner consistent with the determination of the
Accounting Referee. The determination of the Accounting Referee shall be
binding on the Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such determination
shall be limited to the resolution of issues in dispute. The fees and
disbursements of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by the Party (i.e., the
Sellers, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand), that assigned
amounts to items in dispute that were, on a net basis, furthest in amount from
the amount finally determined by the Accounting Referee, or equally, in the
event the Parties assigned amounts were, on a net basis, equally far from the
amount finally determined by the Accounting Referee. Except as expressly
contemplated in this  _Article VII_ ,

 



39

    

 under no circumstances shall the Purchaser or the Acquired Entities amend
any Tax Returns for Pre-Closing Periods without the prior written consent of
the Sellers Representative (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, it being understood that such consent will be deemed
to be unreasonably withheld if the amendment is required by law).

 

7.1.4 In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on)
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), (a) the amount of any Taxes (other
than Taxes described in clause (b)) for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined based on a closing of the books as of the close of business on the
Closing Date (and for such purpose, the taxable period of any partnership or
other pass-through entity in which any of the Acquired Entities holds a
beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and (b) in the
case of property Taxes or other such ad valorem Taxes imposed on an annual
basis, the amount of Taxes of the Acquired Entities for a Straddle Period that
relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.

 

7.1.5 The Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall cooperate fully in
connection with the filing of the Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.1_ and in connection with any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to the Taxes of the Acquired Entities. Such cooperation shall include
reasonably furnishing or making available during normal business hours of
personnel and the retention and (upon a Partys request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to the preparation of any
such Tax Return or to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding.
The Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall retain or cause to be
retained all books and records that are in their possession with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Entities relating to any Pre-Closing
Period or Straddle Period in accordance with their record retentions policy,
and abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Governmental Authority.

 

7.1.6 The Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall, upon request, use
their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate
any Transfer Taxes that could be imposed with respect to the transaction
contemplated hereby.

 

7.1.7 To the extent that, subsequent to the date hereof, any of the Acquired
Entities receives (a) any refund of Taxes (in the form of cash) attributable
to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that consist of Taxes that were (x) paid by the
Acquired Entities prior to Closing, (y) included in Accrued Tax Liabilities,
and results in an actual reduction in Transaction Consideration , or (z)
indemnified by the Sellers pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ or _Article IX_
hereof, or (b) any credits against Taxes currently payable in lieu of refunds
described in clause (a), the Purchaser shall remit, and shall cause the
Acquired Entities, as applicable, to remit such Tax refund(s) or credits,
_less_ any Taxes, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such refund
or credit, to the Sellers, within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt by
any of the Acquired Entities of such Tax refunds or utilization of such Tax
credits; _provided_ , that no such refund or credit shall be required to be
transmitted to the Sellers to the extent that (i) such refund or credit was
taken into account in calculating the Transaction Consideration (as finally
determined), (ii) such refund arose as a result of a carryback of any Tax
attribute or credit arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion thereof)
or (iii) the Sellers are obligated to pay any amounts to the Purchaser
pursuant to this _Article VII_.

 



40

    

7.1.8 The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Purchaser shall not file
an election under Section 338(g) (or Section 336) of the Code or any similar
provision of the law of any state or other taxing jurisdiction with respect to
the acquisition LTCO in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

7.1.9 The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that any and all Transaction
Tax Deductions shall be reported as deductible in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
or allocable to the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date, in each case to the extent allowed by applicable Law based on a
"more likely than not" or higher level of comfort. The Parties hereby agree to
prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with such allocation. The Parties
that any disagreement as to such reporting will be settled in a
manner consistent with the dispute resolution process set forth in _Section_
__ _ 7.1.3_.

7.1.10 _Tax Claims_. In the event a claim is made or a deficiency alleged
following the Closing relating to any of the Acquired Entities by the IRS, any
other taxing authority, or any third party which, if successful, would result
in a loss or liability in respect of which indemnity properly will be sought
against the Sellers, severally, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(b)_
(collectively, an "Indemnity Tax Matter"), then the following shall apply:

 

7.1.11 After any of the Acquired Entities receives actual notice of a claim or
alleged deficiency, the Purchaser shall, or the Purchaser shall cause the
applicable Acquired Entity to, promptly notify the Sellers Representative in
writing of such claim or alleged deficiency.

 

7.1.12 The Sellers Representative shall have the right to represent the
interests of the applicable Acquired Entity before the relevant Governmental
Authority or the relevant third party with respect to any Indemnity Tax Matter
and shall have the right to control the defense, compromise or other
resolution of any such Indemnity Tax Matter (including responding to
inquiries, and contesting, defending against and resolving any assessment for
additional Taxes or notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of,
or relating to, any such Indemnity Tax Matter); _provided_ , that (a) the
Sellers Representative provides to the Purchaser written notice electing to
control such Indemnity Tax Matter, (b) the requirements in _Section_ __ _
9.4.1(b)_ of this Agreement (other than the reference to Governmental
Authority pursuant to clause (v) thereof) are satisfied, and (c) the insurer
under the RandW Policy is not entitled, or if entitled does not elect, to assume
the defense of such Indemnity Tax Matter. If the Sellers Representative does
not assume control of such matters, the Purchaser shall have the right to
control such matters. The Purchaser shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to participate in the defense of such Indemnity Tax Matter that is
not controlled by the Purchaser and to employ counsel, at the Purchasers own
expense, separate from counsel employed by the Sellers Representative on
behalf of the Sellers, and the Sellers Representative shall keep the
Purchaser informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any
such Indemnity Tax Matter and will, in good faith, allow the Purchaser to
consult with it regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such
action.

 

7.1.13 Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 7.1.12_, the Sellers
Representative shall not settle or compromise any Indemnity Tax Matter
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 



41

    

7.1.14 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or
otherwise, in connection with any Indemnity Tax Matter, the Sellers shall, to
the extent permitted under applicable Law, make, or shall cause to be made, in
respect of the LTLLC (or if the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
LTLLC after the Closing) is entitled, the Purchaser may make or cause to be
made) an election "out" under Section 6221(b) of the Code or, if such election
is not available, an election to "push out" adjustments under Section 6226 of
the Code (or any comparable provision in any state, local or foreign Tax Law)
in respect of any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing (and the Sellers shall take any actions necessary to give effect to
this sentence).

 

7.2 _Transfer Taxes_. The Taiwan securities transaction tax (the "Taiwan STT")
and all other transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration, value
added and other such similar Taxes (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with this Agreement (including any real property
transfer Tax and other similar Tax) or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes"), shall be borne by the Sellers
when due, and the all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Taxes or fees shall be filed by the party that is
required by law to file such Tax Returns (and other party shall cooperate with
respect thereto as necessary). For the avoidance of doubt, the Taiwan STT
shall be borne by the Sellers but paid by the Purchaser on behalf of the
Sellers in accordance with _Sections 2.4.7_ and _2.5.5(a)_ ; _provided_ ,
that in the event that the Transaction Consideration, as finally determined in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, is less than the Estimated Taiwan
Transaction Consideration, the Sellers shall have the right to determine
whether any claim for refund of Taiwan STT shall be made, and, if the Sellers
elect to make such a claim, the Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate at
Sellers expense in connection therewith, including the preparation of any
Return that is required to be filed by the Purchaser and/or Sellers, as the
case maybe, in connection with such claim; _provided_ , that if the filing of
such a claim could have an adverse effect on the Tax liability of Purchaser
or its Subsidiaries (including LeanTeq Co. Ltd.) for which Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries are not fully indemnified under this Agreement, the Sellers shall
not be entitled to require such claim to be filed without the written consent
of the Purchaser, not to be unreasonably withheld. Any such refunds shall be
paid to Sellers in accordance with the provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _
7.1.7_.

 

7.3 _Liability and Indemnity for Taxes_.

 

7.3.1 The Sellers will be solely responsible for, and shall severally and not
jointly (in accordance with the proportion of the Transaction Consideration,
including the Rollover Amount, allocated to such Seller pursuant to the
Allocation Certificate) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, any and all Damages (including Taxes) actually incurred
or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to the extent resulting or
arising from (collectively, the "Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities") (a) all Taxes
imposed upon the Acquired Entities or for which the Acquired Entities are
liable with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, (b) with respect to Straddle
Periods, if any, all Taxes imposed upon the Acquired Entities or for which the
Acquired Entities are liable which are allocable, pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1.4_, to the Pre-Closing portion of such Straddle Period, (c) all Taxes of
the Sellers, including any Taxes that may be

 



42

    

 imposed on LTLLC pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, as amended,
(d) all Taxes imposed on the Acquired Entities as a transferee or successor,
by contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring before the Closing Date and (e) arising as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including Transfer Taxes for
which the Seller is liable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ and any Taxes
resulting from the transactions described in _Sections 6.12_ and 6.13 herein).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers shall not be liable for any such
Taxes that are included in Accrued Tax Liabilities or Selling Expenses, and,
in each case, result in an actual reduction in the Transaction Consideration.

7.3.2 For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers obligations to indemnify the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties for Damages arising from Pre-Closing Tax
Liabilities shall be subject to the limitations set forth in _Article IX_ ,
but only to the extent not inconsistent with the provisions of this _Article
VII_.

7.4 The Purchaser and the Sellers agree that the Transaction Consideration,
along with any other amounts constituting consideration for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, shall be allocated among the Acquired Entities
transferred by the Sellers based on the Allocation Certificate and
the covenants contained in this Agreement (the "Purchase Price Allocation").
Any adjustments to the Transaction Consideration or such other amounts shall
be allocated in an appropriate and equitable manner consistent with
the requirements of applicable Law. The Purchaser and the Sellers further
agree that the amounts allocated to LTLLC pursuant to the first sentence of
this paragraph shall be allocated among the assets of LTLLC in a manner
consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder (the "Asset Allocation"). The Purchaser shall prepare a
proposed Purchase Price Allocation and Asset Allocation and deliver it to the
Sellers Representative as soon as reasonably practicable following the
Closing Date, and in any event within one hundred twenty (120) days thereof,
for the Sellers Representatives review. The Sellers Representative shall
have thirty (30) days after the delivery to object in writing, and if it does
not object within such period, shall be deemed to have accepted such proposed
Purchaser Price Allocation and Asset Allocation and it shall become final. If
the Sellers Representative objects, it shall deliver written notice of such
objection within thirty (30) days after delivery of such proposed Purchase
Price Allocation and Asset Allocation. The Parties thereafter shall negotiate
in good faith to resolve any differences regarding such proposed Asset
Allocation and if they cannot agree in fifteen (15) days after delivery of a
written objection, the matters in dispute (but only the matters in dispute)
shall be submitted to the Accounting Referee for resolution. The
determination of the Accounting Referee shall be binding on the Parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such determination shall be limited to the
resolution of issues in dispute. The fees and disbursements of the Accounting
Referee shall be borne by the Party (i.e., the Sellers, on the one hand, and
the Purchaser, on the other hand), that assigned amounts to items in dispute
that were, on a net basis, furthest in amount from the amount finally
determined by the Accounting Referee, or equally, in the event the Parties
assigned amounts were, on a net basis, equally far from the amount finally
determined by the Accounting Referee. Any adjustments to the amounts allocated
to LTLLC shall be allocated to the assets of LTLLC in an appropriate and
equitable manner consistent with the requirements of applicable Law and
consistent with the principles set forth on the Asset Allocation. The Parties
shall (i) timely file all Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594 and any supplemental filings to reflect any revisions to the
Purchase Price Allocation or Asset Allocation) required to be filed in
connection with the Purchase Price Allocation, the Asset Allocation and
any adjustments thereto agreed to by

 



43

    

 the Parties, and (ii) prepare and file all Tax Returns and determine all
Taxes in a manner consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation, the Asset
Allocation and any adjustments thereto agreed to by the Parties. Each of the
Parties shall notify the other if it receives notice that any Tax Authority
proposes any allocation different from that set forth on the Purchase Price
Allocation, the Asset Allocation and any adjustments thereto agreed to by the
Parties.

7.5 At Closing, the Sellers shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Purchasers the following: (a) each Seller that is a United States Person
within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "U.S. Person") (or,
if a Seller is disregarded as an entity from a U.S. Person for federal income
tax purposes, such U.S. Person) shall deliver to the Purchaser an appropriate
duly executed certificate of non-foreign status in compliance with Section
1446(f)(2) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv) substantially
in the form attached hereto as _Schedule 7.5_ and a duly executed IRS Form
W-9, and (b) each Seller that is not a U.S. Person shall deliver to the
Purchaser an applicable duly executed IRS Form W-8.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION_

 

9.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the Parties contained in
this Agreement or in any certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement or
in connection herewith will survive the Closing for fifteen (15) months
thereafter; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a) the representations and
warranties in the first two sentences of  _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ (Existence and
Qualification), _Section_ __ _ 3.2_ (Authorization; Enforceability), Section
_ 3.4_ (Capitalization), _Section_ __ _ 3.20_ (Finders Fees),  _Section_
__ _ 4.1_ (Organization), _Section_ __ _ 4.2_ (Authorization;
Enforceability), _Section_ __ _ 4.5_ (Finders Fees), _Section_ __ _ 4.6_
(Ownership of Securities),  _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ (Organization), _Section_ __
_ 5.2_ (Authorization; Enforceability) and _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ (Finders

statute of limitations, and (b) the representations and warranties in
_Section_ __ _ 3.6_ (Tax Matters) and the indemnity obligations set forth in

after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to
the collection by the applicable Governmental Authority or other Person of
the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or
extension thereof). For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereby acknowledge
that the survival period set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ with respect
to non-Fundamental Representations is a contractual statute of limitations and
any claim brought by any Party pursuant to this _Article IX_ must be brought
or filed prior to the expiration of such survival period. It is the express
intent of the Parties that, if an applicable survival period as contemplated
by this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ is shorter than the statute of limitations that

 



46

    

 would otherwise apply by Law, then, by contract, the applicable statute of
limitations shall be reduced to the survival period contemplated hereby. The
Parties further acknowledge that the time periods set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 9.1_ for the assertion of claims under this Agreement are the result of
arms-length negotiation among the Parties and that they intend for the time
periods to be enforced as agreed by the Parties.

9.2 _Indemnification by the Sellers_.

 

9.2.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article IX_ , the Sellers
shall, severally and not jointly (in accordance with the proportion of the

owners, directors, managers, officers, employees and Affiliates, and, after
the Closing, the Acquired Entities (collectively, all of the foregoing the
"Purchaser Indemnified Parties") against any and all Damages actually incurred
or suffered by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to the extent resulting or
arising from:

(a) any failure of any representation or warranty made by any Seller in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement (including
the Sellers Certificate) to be true and correct (without giving effect to any
limitations or qualifications thereto, including materiality or Material
Adverse Effect); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Seller shall be required to
indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnified Party with
respect to a breach of any representation or warranty made solely by another
Seller pursuant to _Article IV_ (in which case such other Seller or Sellers
shall be responsible for indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties
in accordance with this Agreement);

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement required to be performed by the
Acquired Entities or any Seller (including the Sellers Representative in its
capacity as such) pursuant to this Agreement (without giving effect to any
limitations or qualifications thereto, including materiality or Material
Adverse Effect); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Seller shall be required to
indemnify, defend or hold harmless any Purchaser Indemnified Party with
respect to a breach of any covenant or agreement made or to be performed
solely by another Seller or other Sellers pursuant to this Agreement (in which
case such other Seller or Sellers shall be responsible for indemnification of
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in accordance with this Agreement); or

(c) any claims relating to allocation of the Transaction Consideration and
Rollover Amount among the Sellers, including any inaccuracy or
misrepresentation on the Allocation Certificate.

(d) Any deficiency reflected in the Final Adjustment Statement that exceeds
the amount of the Working Capital Escrow Amount.

9.2.2 _Time Limitations_. The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no
right to recover any amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(a)_ unless on
or before the relevant survival date specified in _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ (such
relevant date referred to as the "Survival Date"), the Purchaser notifies the
Sellers Representative in writing of a claim specifying the factual basis of
that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by the Purchaser.
Except as otherwise provided in the Agreement, all covenants of the Parties
contained in _Article VI_ will survive the Closing

 



47

    

 indefinitely in accordance with their terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any amounts
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(b)_ unless the Purchaser notifies the
Sellers Representative in writing of a claim under _Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(b)_
specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent
then known by the Purchaser as follows: (a) with respect to any covenant or
agreement required to be performed in this Agreement on or before the Closing,
such claim is delivered within six (6) months after the Closing, (b) with

respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Liabilities and claim for a breach of Tax
representations and covenants (including the representations and warranties

9.2.3 _Limitations on Indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties_.

 

(a) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(a)_ until the total amount of all
claims as to which the Purchaser Indemnified Parties may be entitled to
indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(a)_, in the aggregate, exceeds
$1,500,000 (the "Deductible"), in which case the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties will be entitled to recover any Damages pursuant to _Section_ __ _
9.2.1(a)_ in excess of the Deductible, subject to the other limitations in
this _Article IX_ ; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that recovery of any amounts
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(a)_ related to the breach of the Fundamental
Representations or _Section_ __ _ 3.6_ (Tax Matters) or to fraud shall not be
subject to the limitations of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2.3(a)_.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary but
subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.5.1_, each Sellers maximum aggregate
indemnification liability pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(a)_ shall be such
Sellers pro rata share of the funds in the Escrow Account; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such maximum aggregate indemnification liability shall not
apply to breaches of the Fundamental Representations or _Section_ __ _ 3.6_
(Tax Matters), for which each Sellers maximum aggregate indemnification
liability pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(a)_ with respect to breaches of
all types for which indemnification is available hereunder shall not exceed
the Transaction Consideration received by such Seller. Except with respect to
the Fundamental Representations in _Articles_ __ _ III_ and _IV_ , _Section_
__ _ 3.6_ (Tax Matters) or fraud, the sole and exclusive recourse against
the Sellers for any amount finally determined to be owed in respect of any
indemnity obligations pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(a)_ shall be the funds
remaining in the Escrow Account, and once the Escrow Account shall be
fully depleted or released, such indemnity obligations of the Sellers shall
terminate.

(c) A Purchaser Indemnified Party may not seek indemnification for Damages
suffered by it if, and to the extent, it has already received payment with
respect to the underlying circumstances relating to such Damages by virtue of
a reduction in Transaction Consideration pursuant to a post-
Closing adjustment under _Section_ __ _ 2.5_.

 



48

    

9.3 _Indemnification by the Purchaser_.

 

9.3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this _Article IX_ , the Purchaser
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers, their Affiliates and
their respective officers, directors, managers, shareholders, members,
partners, employees, representatives and agents (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Parties") against any and all Damages actually incurred
or suffered by the Seller Indemnified Parties to the extent resulting from
(a) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser in
this Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement to be
true and correct as of the date hereof and as of the Closing and (b) any
breach of any covenant or agreement required to be performed by the Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement.

 

9.3.2 The Seller Indemnified Parties shall have no right to recover any
amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3.1(a)_ unless on or before the
Survival Date, the Sellers Representative notifies the Purchaser in writing

the extent then known by the Sellers Representative. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement, the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
have no right to recover any amounts pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.3.1(b)_

claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the
extent then known by the Sellers Representative as follows: (a) with respect
to any covenant or agreement required to be performed in this Agreement on or
before the Closing, such claim is delivered within six (6) months after the

days after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

9.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

9.4.1 Except as provided in _Article VII_ with respect to certain Tax matters,
if any Person who or which is entitled to seek indemnification under _Article
VII_ , _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ or _9.3_ (an "Indemnified Party") receives notice
of the assertion or commencement of any Third Party Claim against such
Indemnified Party with respect to which the Person against whom or which such
indemnification is being sought (an "Indemnifying Party") is obligated to
provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party will give
such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party will describe the Third Party Claim in reasonable
detail, will include copies of any complaint, petition or any other pleading
received in connection with such Third Party Claim and all available material
written evidence thereof, and will indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Damages that have been or may be sustained by
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying
Partys expense, or at its option (subject to the limitations set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 9.4.1_) to assume the defense thereof by appointing a
recognized and reputable counsel to be the lead counsel in connection with
such defense; _provided_ , _however_ , that:

 

(a) The Indemnifying Party must give the Indemnified Party written notice of
its election to assume control of the defense of the Third Party Claim within
ten (10) days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of the Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party disclaims any liability in connection with
such matter, the Indemnifying Party shall give the 

 



49

    

 Indemnified Party written notice of such disclaimer of liability within ten
(10) days of the Indemnifying Partys receipt of notice of the Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party timely disclaims any Third Party Claim,
whether in full or in part, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith for
a period of twenty (20) Business Days from the date the Indemnified Party
receives such objection (such period is hereinafter referred to as the "Third
Party Claim Negotiation Period"). After the Third Party Claim Negotiation
Period, if the Parties still cannot agree on such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
the Indemnified Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party may only assume such defense (i) if
it acknowledges in writing that it is within the scope of the indemnification
obligations set forth in this _Article IX_ or _Article VII_ , as applicable,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with evidence
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
will have adequate financial resources to defend against the Third Party Claim
and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (iii) the Third Party
Claim involves only monetary damages and does not seek an injunction, other
equitable relief or criminal liabilities against the Indemnified Party, (iv)
the maximum amount of monetary damages and related costs and expenses which
could be payable with respect to such Third Party Claim does not exceed the
maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party
Claim hereunder, (v) the Third Party Claim is not made by any Governmental
Authority or Material Customer or Material Supplier, and (vi) the Indemnified
Party has not been advised by counsel that an actual or potential conflict
exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in connection
with the defense of the Third Party Claim.

 

(c) The Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
the Third Party Claim and to employ a recognized and reputable counsel of its
choice for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses
of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party.

 

(d) The Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any Third Party
Claim unless the terms of such settlement or compromise (i) call only for a
payment to the Indemnified Party (or of the Third Party Claim directly), the
full amount of which is indemnified hereunder, (ii) does not impose an
injunction or other equitable relief upon the Indemnified Party, (iii) does
not require an admission or acknowledgment of fault by the Indemnified Party
and (iv) contains an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party in respect
of such claim. If requested in writing by the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim or, if appropriate and related to
the Third Party Claim in question, in making any reasonable counterclaim
against the Person making such Third Party Claim, or any cross complaint
against any Person (other than the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates) or
similar action. If the Indemnifying Party shall not have elected to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim within ten (10) days of receipt of the
written notice described in _Section_ __ _ 9.4.1_, or is otherwise not
entitled to assume such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right,
at its option and at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, to do so in such
manner as it deems appropriate. In the event any Indemnified Party assumes the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate with
the Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim or,
if appropriate and related to the Third Party Claim in question, in making any
reasonable counterclaim against the Person making such Third Party Claim, or
any cross complaint against any Person (other than the Indemnifying Party or
its Affiliates) or similar action.

 



50

    

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying Party
may only investigate, contest, defend or settle any Third Party Claim if the
insurer under the RandW Policy is not entitled, or if entitled does not elect,
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim.

 

9.4.2 Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of Damages that does not
result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") will be asserted by giving
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof; _provided_ ,
that in the event any Purchaser Indemnified Party is the Indemnified Party, it
shall deliver the written notice of the Direct Claim to the Sellers
Representative and such delivery shall be deemed to have been received by each
Seller. Such notice by the Indemnified Party will describe the Direct Claim in
reasonable detail, will include copies of all available material
written evidence thereof and will indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of Damages that have been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party will have a period of ten (10)
Business Days from which to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party does not respond within such ten (10) Business Day period,
the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have rejected such claim. If the
Indemnifying Party rejects (or is deemed to have rejected) any Direct Claim,
whether in full or in part, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith for
a period of twenty (20) Business Days from the date the Indemnified Party
receives such objection or is deemed to have rejected such Direct Claim (such
period is hereinafter referred to as the "Negotiation Period"). After the
Negotiation Period, if the parties still cannot agree on the claim, the
Indemnified Party will be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
the Indemnified Party.

9.4.3 A failure to give timely notice or to include any specified information
in any notice as provided in _Sections 9.4.1_ or _9.4.2_ will not affect the
rights or obligations of any Party, except and only to the extent that, as a
result of such failure, any Party that was entitled to receive such notice was
deprived of its right to recover any payment under its applicable insurance
coverage or was otherwise materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

9.5  _Miscellaneous Indemnification Provisions_.

9.5.1 _Exclusive Remedy_. Other than claims for fraud, the
indemnification provisions of this _Article IX_ and _Article VII_ shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties and their respective
Affiliates for monetary damages with respect to claims under, or otherwise
relating to, the transactions that are the subject of, this Agreement,
whether sounding in contract, tort, fraud or otherwise, and whether asserted
against the Acquired Entities, their respective officers, directors or
employees, the Sellers or any other Person. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, in no event shall any Party, its successors or permitted
assigns be entitled to claim or seek rescission of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Parties, on behalf of itself and
its equity owners, directors, managers, officers, employees and Affiliates,
agrees not to bring any actions or proceedings, at Law, equity or otherwise,
against any other Party or its equity owners, directors, managers, officers,
employees and Affiliates, in respect of any breach or alleged breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant and agreement in this Agreement, except
pursuant to the express provisions of this _Article IX_ and _Article VII_. 

 



51

    

 Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, each Party shall be entitled to
bring an action for injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce the terms
of this Agreement, including specific performance, and no limitation or
condition of liability provided in this _Article IX_ or _Article VII_ shall
apply to any claim arising from fraud.

 

9.5.2 _Transaction Consideration Adjustment_. The Parties agree that any
indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Transaction Consideration for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

9.5.3 _Purchaser Knowledge_. The Sellers shall not be liable under this
_Article IX_ (but may be liable under _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ as applicable) for
any Damages based upon or arising out of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of
the representations or warranties of the Sellers contained in this Agreement
if the Purchaser had actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or breach prior to
the date hereof.

 

9.5.4 _Duty to Mitigate_. Subject to the provisions in _Section_ __ _ 9.5.5_,
each Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of
any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give
rise thereto.

 

9.5.5 _Insurance Proceeds and Other Recoveries_.

 

(a) Except for fraud and subject to the limitations set forth in the other
Sections of this _ Article IX_, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties remedy
with respect to Damages for which they may be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _ Section_ __ _ 9.2.1(a)_ shall be as follows: (i) with respect
to representations and warranties (other than Fundamental Representations or
_ Section_ __ _ 3.6_ (Tax Matters)), to satisfy the amount of such Damages
in the following order of priority: first, from the remaining funds in the
Escrow Account until the amount of the retention under the RandW Policy has
been fully eroded, second (once the retention amount under the RandW Policy has
been so fully eroded), from the RandW Policy to the extent available for
recovery, and third, to the extent that any such Damages are unavailable for
recovery from the RandW Policy or in excess of the limits of the RandW Policy,
from the remaining funds in the Escrow Account, and (ii) with respect to
Fundamental Representations and _ Section_ __ _ 3.6_ (Tax Matters) and Tax
indemnity under _ Section_ __ _ 7.3.1_, to satisfy such amount of such
Damages in the following order of priority: first from the remaining funds in
the Escrow Account until the amount of the retention under the RandW Policy has
been fully eroded, second (once the retention amount under the RandW Policy has
been so fully eroded) from the RandW Policy to the extent available for
recovery, third, to the extent that any such Damages are unavailable for
recovery from the RandW Policy or are in excess of the limits of the RandW Policy,
out of the remaining funds in the Escrow Account, and fourth, once the
remaining funds in the Escrow Account have been exhausted, directly against
the Sellers subject to the limitations set forth in this _ Article IX_ and _
Article VII_, as applicable.

 

(b) The amount of Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Article IX_ with respect to an indemnity claim shall be reduced by (a)
solely with respect to Damages incurred by LTCO, the amount of any Net Tax
Benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party, and (b) reduced by any
indemnity or contribution amounts actually received from third parties by an
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with the matter giving

 



52

    

 rise to such Damages (net of any applicable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) of recovery or collection thereof) (such net
recoveries, "Net Recoveries"). If an Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates actually receives a Net Recovery with respect to any Damages after
an Indemnifying Party has actually made a payment to such Indemnified Party or
its Affiliates with respect to such Damages (other than an insurance
recovery), such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying
Party that amount, if any, that such Indemnifying Party would not have been
required to pay to such Indemnified Party or its Affiliate if such Net
Recovery had been received prior to such payment by the Indemnifying Party;
_provided_ , that the Indemnified Party shall not be obligated to pay over any
such amount in excess of the amount of the indemnity payment hereunder to the
Indemnified Party with respect to such claim. The calculation of any Damages
arising out of or in connection with any breach of representations, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement by any party hereto,
shall be made without any regard to any "Material Adverse Effect" or any
materiality or similar qualification contained in the relevant representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement so breached.

 

9.5.6 _No Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, no party shall, in any event, be liable to any
other Person for any punitive Damages of such other Person, except to the
extent actually paid to a third Person.

9.6 _Good Faith; Mutual Cooperation_. The Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with each other with respect to
resolving any claim or liability with respect to which Party is obligated to
indemnify the other Party hereunder, including by making all commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability.

9.7 _Escrow Account; Manner of Payment_.

9.7.1 Within three (3) Business Days following a final determination that a
Purchaser Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification payment from any
Seller pursuant to this _Article IX_ or _Article VII,_ and to the extent any
portion of such Sellers pro rata share of the Escrow Amount remains
undisbursed, the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall deliver
joint instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
distribute to the Purchaser or its designee, by wire transfer in immediately
available funds, from the remaining portion of such Sellers pro rata share
of the Escrow Amount, in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the amount of
such payment, and (ii) such remaining portion.

 

9.7.2 On the first (1st) Business Day following the date which is fifteen (15)
months after the Closing Date (the "Indemnity Escrow Release Date"), the
Purchaser and the Sellers Representative shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to
the Sellers an aggregate amount equal to, if any, (a) the remaining portion
of each Sellers pro rata share of the Escrow Amount, _less_ (b) the aggregate
amount of claimed Damages (each, a "Reserved Loss") for which a claim for
indemnification has been asserted but not yet finally resolved or determined
(each, a "Unresolved Claim") as of the Indemnity Escrow Release Date. At any
time following the Indemnity Escrow Release Date, upon final resolution of any
Unresolved Claim and to the extent that it is finally determined that the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties are not entitled to any portion of the
corresponding Reserved Loss (such portion, the "Released Portion"), the
Sellers Representative and the Purchaser shall, within three (3) Business
Days following such final resolution, deliver joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to release to the Sellers, from
the Escrow Account, an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the remaining
portion of such Sellers pro rata share of the Escrow Amount, and (ii) the
Released Portion.

 



53

    

9.7.3 Following the exhaustion of any Sellers pro rata share of the Escrow
Amount, any amount payable by such Seller to any Purchaser Indemnified Party
shall be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
or accounts designated by Purchaser within three (3) Business Days following
the final determination of the claim for indemnification giving rise to such
payment obligation.

9.7.4 Any amount payable by Purchaser to a Seller Indemnified Party shall be
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by the Sellers within three (3) Business Days following
the final determination of the claim for indemnification giving rise to
such payment obligation.

54

    

(e) by the Purchaser or by the Sellers if the transactions contemplated hereby

_provided_ , _however_ , that the Purchaser or the Sellers, as applicable,
will not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 10.1.1(e)_ if the Purchasers breach of this Agreement, on the one hand,
or if any Sellers breach of this Agreement, on the other hand, has prevented
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by such
date;

(f) by the Sellers if the Parties receive a binding, non-
appealable disapproval under any Purchaser-driven Law; or

(g) by the Purchaser or by the Sellers by reason of a final, non-appealable
Law or Order enacted or issued by any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction that is in effect and has the effect of prohibiting the
transactions contemplated herein.

 

10.1.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 10.1.1_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and all
further obligations of the Parties under this Agreement will terminate without
further liability or obligation on the part of any Party (other than this
_Article X_ , which will continue in full force and effect);  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 10.1.2_ will relieve any
Party of liability for breach of this Agreement occurring prior to any
termination, or for breach of any provision of this Agreement which
specifically survives termination hereunder, subject to the express terms and
limitations set forth in this Agreement.

10.1.3  _Termination Fee_.

(a) If this Agreement is validly terminated by the Sellers pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 10.1.1(d)_ due to a failure to receive the proceeds from the
Financing, then the Purchaser shall pay an amount equal to four percent (4%)
of the Base Purchase Price (the "Termination Fee") to the Sellers promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) following such termination, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Sellers.

 

(b) Subject in all respects to the Sellers right to injunction and specific
performance under _Section_ __ _ 10.15_, if this Agreement is validly
terminated under circumstances in which the Purchaser is obligated to pay the
Termination Fee under _Section_ __ _ 10.1.3(a)_, payment of the Termination
Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Sellers, the Acquired
Entities, the Sellers Representative and their respective Affiliates and the
heirs, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing Persons (collectively,
the "Sellers Related Parties"), as applicable, against the Purchaser and its
Affiliates, and each of their respective former, current and future directors,
officers, employees, equityholders, controlling Persons, members, managers,
financing sources, general or limited partners, assignees or other Affiliates
or Representatives, and the Debt Financing Parties (collectively, the
"Purchaser Related Parties"), and upon payment of such Termination Fee
pursuant to the terms hereof, the Sellers Related Parties shall have no
further rights or claims against any Purchaser Related Parties under or
arising out of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for
such termination, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise; _provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement will limit in any way
the remedies of the parties under the

 



55

    

 Confidentiality Agreement. Following the receipt of the Termination Fee in
such circumstance, (i) none of the Sellers Related Parties shall be entitled
to bring, maintain or support any Actions against any Purchaser Related Party
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming
the basis for such termination, and (ii) each Sellers Related Party shall
cause any Actions pending in connection with this Agreement, the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby,
to the extent maintained by such Seller Related Party against any Purchaser
Related Party to be dismissed with prejudice promptly. In no event shall the
Purchaser Related Parties be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. Under no circumstances shall the Sellers be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance that results in the
consummation of the Closing and payment of the Termination Fee.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, in no event, whether or
not this Agreement has been terminated, shall Purchaser Related Parties be
subject to any monetary liability in excess of the Termination Fee.

 

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, that the payment of the Termination Fee is not a penalty,
but instead is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that shall
compensate the Sellers and their Affiliates, in the circumstances in which the
Termination Fee is payable, for the efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and in reliance on this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision.

10.2 _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document required
or permitted to be given under this Agreement by any Party to another Party
will be in writing and will be given to such Party (a) at its address set
forth below or to such other address as the Party to whom notice is to be
given may provide in a written notice to the Party giving such notice or (b)
after Closing, if such Party is a Seller, at the address of the Sellers

Business Day after being furnished to a nationally recognized overnight
courier for next Business Day delivery, or (z) on the date sent if sent by
electronic mail, receipt confirmed in each case, with a copy
contemporaneously being sent pursuant to clauses (x) or (y) above:

10.3 _Amendments and Waivers_.

 

10.3.1 Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only
if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by the Purchaser and the Sellers Representative (or by any
successor to such Party), or in the case of a waiver, by the Party against
whom the waiver is to be effective.

 

10.3.2 No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power, or
privilege under this Agreement will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.

 

10.3.3 Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ and
_Sections_ _10.1.3(b)_ , _10.5_ ,  _10.7_ , _10.8_ , _10.9_ and _10.16_ (and
any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification,
supplement or waiver would modify the substance of any of the foregoing
provisions) may not be amended, modified or supplemented, and none of such
provisions may be waived, in each case in a manner adverse to any Debt
Financing Parties without the written consent of such adversely affected Debt
Financing Parties.

 



57

    

10.4 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (a)
the Purchaser will pay or cause to be paid the fees and expenses incurred by
the Purchaser (and its Affiliates) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or relating to the negotiation, preparation or
execution of this Agreement or any documents or agreements contemplated
hereby or the performance or consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (b) the Sellers will pay or cause to be paid the Selling
Expenses to the extent not otherwise paid as contemplated in _Section_ __ _
2.1_.

10.5 _Successors and Assigns_. The provisions of this Agreement will
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party may assign,
delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party to this
Agreement; except that the Purchaser may (a) assign any of its rights (but not
its obligations) under this Agreement to any Affiliate (but such assignment
shall not release the Purchaser of its obligations hereunder), including the
assignment of the acquisition of the securities of the Acquired Entities to
the Purchaser Designee, and (b) collaterally assign this Agreement to the
Financing Source or any other lender providing Financing or alternative
Financing as collateral.

10.6 _Sellers_ __ _Representative_.

 

10.6.1 By the executing this Agreement, each Seller shall be deemed to have
approved the designation of, and hereby designates,
Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the Sellers Representative for
all purposes in connection with this Agreement and the agreements ancillary
hereto. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any right or action
that may be taken at the election of the Sellers will be taken by the
Sellers Representative as a representative of the Sellers on behalf thereof.
Upon the resignation of Shareholder Representative Services LLC as the initial
Sellers Representative, the holders of a majority of the voting power of the
Securities at any time prior to the Closing may designate a successor Sellers
Representative.

 

10.6.2 The Sellers Representative may resign at any time. Any change in the
Sellers Representative will become effective upon notice in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 10.2_.

10.6.3 Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably appoint the
Sellers Representative as the agent and attorney-in-fact of each of the
Sellers for the purposes of acting in the name and stead of such Seller in:
(a) paying any associated costs and expenses of the transactions hereunder
required to be paid by such Seller following the Closing; (b) giving and
receiving all notices permitted or required by this Agreement and acting on
the Sellers behalf hereunder for all purposes specified herein; (c) agreeing
with the Purchaser as to any amendments to this Agreement which the Sellers
Representative may deem necessary or advisable, including the extension of
time in which to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and the waiver of any closing conditions; (d) employing legal counsel on
behalf of the Sellers; (e) paying any legal, accounting, investment banking,
and any other fees and expenses incurred by the Sellers Representative in
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (f) defending or
settling claims arising under this Agreement; and (g) making, executing,
acknowledging, and delivering all such contracts, orders, receipts, notices,
requests, instructions, certificates, letters, and other writings, and in
general doing all things and taking all actions which the Sellers
Representative, in its sole discretion, may consider necessary or proper
in connection with or to

 



58

    

 carry out the terms of this Agreement, as fully as if such Sellers were
personally present and acting. This power of attorney and all authority
conferred hereby is granted and conferred subject to the interests of the
other Parties to this Agreement, and in consideration of those interests and
for the purpose of completing the transactions contemplated hereby, this power
of attorney and all authority conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and shall
not be terminated by the Sellers or by operation of Law, whether by the
termination of the Sellers Representative or by the occurrence of any other
event. If any Seller who is an individual should die or become incompetent
or incapacitated, or any Seller that is a legal entity should be dissolved,
liquidated or wound up any other event should occur before the delivery of
certificates or other instruments of transfer representing the Securities
pursuant to this Agreement, such certificates and instruments shall
nevertheless be delivered by or on behalf of such Seller in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and all actions taken by the
Sellers Representative pursuant to this Agreement shall be as valid as if
such death, incompetence, incapacity, dissolution, termination or winding up
or other event had not occurred, regardless of whether the Purchaser or the
Sellers Representative, or any of them, shall have received notice of such
death, incompetence, incapacity, or other event. The Sellers and the Sellers
Representative agree to the exculpation and indemnification provisions in that
certain engagement letter among the Sellers Representative and the Sellers.

10.6.4 The Purchaser shall be entitled to rely on the actions or inaction of
and instructions and communications from the Sellers Representative, and the
Purchaser shall have no liability to any Seller under this Agreement arising
out of or related to such actions, inaction, instructions or communications.

 

10.7 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.12_,  _Article IX_ , _Section_ __ _ 10.1.3(b)_, _Section_
__ _ 10.3_, _Section_ __ _ 10.8_, _Section_ __ _ 10.9_ and _Section_ __ _
10.16_ (in each case each Person benefiting from the provisions thereof shall
be the intended third-party beneficiaries thereof and entitled to the benefits
of such provisions to the same extent as if they were parties to this
Agreement), this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties and their
permitted assigns and nothing herein expressed or implied will give or be
construed to give to any Person, other than the Parties and such permitted
assigns, any legal or equitable rights under this Agreement.

 

10.8 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_. This Agreement will be governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the Law of the State of Delaware
without regard to the conflict of Laws rules of such state. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably consents and agrees that it shall bring any action,
suit or proceeding with respect to any matter arising under or relating to
this Agreement or the subject matter hereof in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or if jurisdiction is not available in such court, then in
any federal court located in the State of Delaware), unless such party, based
on the good faith advice of its counsel, determines that a judgment rendered
by such court would not be enforceable in the jurisdiction of the organization
of the other Party or a jurisdiction in which such other Partys office(s) or
assets are located. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably accepts and
submits, for itself and in respect of its properties, to the jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if jurisdiction is not
available in such court, then in any federal court located in the State of
Delaware), in personam, generally and unconditionally, with respect to any
such action, suit or proceeding. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
consents to the service of process in any such action, suit or proceeding
in any such court by the mailing of a copy thereof by registered or certified
mail, postage prepaid, to such party

 



59

    

 at the address specified in _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ for notices to such Party.
In addition to or in lieu of any such service, service of process may also be
made in any other manner permitted by applicable Law. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection or defense which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue to any such action, suit
or proceeding in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if
jurisdiction is not available in such court, then in any federal court located
in the State of Delaware) and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
and agrees not to plead or claim that any such action, suit or proceeding
brought in such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, all
claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise) against the Financing Source and its current, former or future
directors, officers, general or limited partners, stockholders, members,
managers, controlling persons, Affiliates, employees or advisors (each, a
"Debt Financing Party" and collectively, the "Debt Financing Parties") in any
way relating to the Commitment Letter, the Financing or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed
by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
laws of another jurisdiction.

 

10.9 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES ITS RIGHTS TO A JURY
TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF OR THEREOF. EACH PARTY ALSO WAIVES ANY
BOND OR SURETY OR SECURITY UPON SUCH BOND WHICH MIGHT, BUT FOR THIS WAIVER, BE
REQUIRED OF SUCH PARTY. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED TO BE ALL-
ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MIGHT BE FILED IN ANY COURT AND THAT
MAY RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ALL COMMON LAW
AND STATUTORY CLAIMS. EACH PARTY FURTHER REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT HAS
REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL AND THAT IT KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH SUCH
LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT MAY NOT BE
MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY
SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, MODIFICATIONS, SUPPLEMENTS OR RESTATEMENTS HEREOF. IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A
TRIAL BY THE COURT. THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS SHALL ALSO APPLY TO ANY CLAIM OR
CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER AT LAW, IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TROT OR OTHERWISE)
AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THE COMMITMENT LETTER,
THE FINANCING OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE FINANCINGS CONTEMPLATED
THEREBY.

10.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute
the same agreement, and the execution of a counterpart of the signature page
to this Agreement shall be deemed the execution of a counterpart of this
Agreement. The delivery of this Agreement may be made by facsimile, email or
other means of electronic submission in portable document format (pdf), and
such signatures shall be treated as original signatures for all applicable
purposes.

 



60

    

10.11 _Headings_. The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and will not control or affect the meaning or construction of
any provisions of this Agreement.

10.12 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Disclosure
Schedules, Schedules and Annexes to this Agreement) and Ancillary Agreements
constitute the entire agreement among the Parties and supersede any other
agreements, whether written or oral, that may have been made or entered into
by or among any of the Parties or any of their respective Affiliates relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation the
nondisclosure agreement dated April 5, 2019 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights,
liabilities and obligations respecting the subject matter of this Agreement,
and transactions contemplated hereby, exclusively in contract pursuant to the
express terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
and the Parties expressly disclaim that they are owed any duties or are
entitled to any remedies not expressly set forth in this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements. Furthermore, the Parties each hereby acknowledge that
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements embody the justifiable
expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arms-length negotiations,
and all Parties specifically acknowledge that no Party has any special
relationship with another Party that would justify any expectation beyond that
of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arms length transaction.

 

10.13 _Confidentiality_. The provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain binding and in full force and effect until the Closing.

10.14 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement or the application of
any such provision to any Person or circumstance is held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision
and such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision will be reformed,
construed and enforced as if such provision had never been contained herein
and there had been contained in this Agreement instead such valid, legal and
enforceable provisions as would most nearly accomplish the intent and purpose
of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

10.15 _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by the Parties in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the other and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to
thereafter cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated on
the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in this Agreement;
_provided_ , that the Sellers shall be entitled to specific performance to
cause the Purchaser to consummate the Closing in accordance with  _Section_
__ _ 2.2_, on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Agreement, if
and only if: (a) the proceeds of the Financing have been funded or will be
funded subject only to the substantially concurrent consummation of the
Closing; (b) the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ have been satisfied or
waived (other than those conditions that would be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions at the Closing); and (c)
the Purchaser is otherwise required by this Agreement to consummate the
Closing. The foregoing rights are in addition to and without limitation of any
other remedy to which the parties may be entitled at law or in equity. The
Parties agree not to assert that a remedy of specific

 



61

    

 performance is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for
any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy. Each of the Parties waives (i) any defenses in any action
for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate and (ii) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other
security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. 

10.16 _Non-Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, (a) each Seller, each Acquired Entity and their respective
Subsidiaries and it and their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents, partners, managers, members and stockholders shall not have
any rights or claims against any Debt Financing Party in any way relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Commitment Letter, the Financing or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise and (b) no Debt Financing Party shall have
any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to any Seller, any
Acquired Entity, or any of their respective subsidiaries, or to it or their
respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents,
partners, managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or
liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based
on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have
been made in connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter, the Financing or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or
in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise; _provided_ , that none of the
foregoing shall be interpreted as (i) limiting the ability of Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser to enforce their rights and remedies under the
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement relating thereto or (ii)
otherwise limiting the obligations of the Financing Source to Purchaser (and
its successors, assigns and Affiliates) and/or the other rights of
the parties to the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreement relating
thereto.

10.17 _Press Release and Announcements_. Unless required by Law or applicable
stock exchange listing requirements (in which case each Party agrees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other Parties reasonably
in advance prior to any such disclosure as to the form and content of such
disclosure), no press releases or other public releases of information related
to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the transactions contemplated
hereby will be issued or released without the consent of the Purchaser and
the Sellers. Solely in the event that the Parties issue such a press release,
the Sellers Representative shall be permitted to publicly announce that it
has been engaged to serve as the Sellers Representative in connection
herewith as long as such announcement does not disclose any of the other
terms of the transactions contemplated herein.

(a) _Continuation of Existence_. The Board of Directors shall take all actions
which may be necessary or appropriate (i) for the continuation of the

Company or for any other damages incurred by reason of any act or omission
performed or omitted by such Director or officer in good faith on behalf of
the Company and in a manner reasonably believed to be within the scope of
the authority conferred on such person by this Agreement (including approval
of, or acting in furtherance of, any matter permitted by this Agreement);
provided, however, that this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)(ii)_ shall not eliminate
or limit the liability of a Director or

 



17

    

 officer of the Company for (x) any breach of the Directors duty of loyalty
to the Company or its Members collectively as a whole (as distinguished from a
duty of loyalty owed to any Member or by Members holding a controlling
interest in the Company to Members holding a minority interest in the Company)
other than by reason of any action or inaction expressly permitted or required
by this Agreement, (y) acts or omissions not in good faith and which involve
intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law, or (z) any transaction
from which such Director or officer derived an improper personal benefit.

 

(c) This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any
implied duty (including any fiduciary duty) otherwise existing at law or in
equity on any of the Directors, any officer, any Member (including Purchaser
or any of its affiliates) or any affiliate, officer, director, employee or
agent of any of the foregoing (each of the foregoing, a " _Responsible Party_
") to act or refrain from acting in the best interest of or to protect or
promote the interest of the Rollover Equityholders, as distinguished from the
interest of the Company and its Members as a whole. To the fullest extent
permitted by Law, and notwithstanding any duty otherwise existing at law or
in equity, each of the Company, the Directors, the Members, and any other
person or entity that is a party to or is otherwise bound by this Agreement
(including (a) the Company in its capacity as a debtor or debtor in
possession in a bankruptcy case commenced under 11 U.S.C. (a " _Bankruptcy
Case_ "), (b) any successor to the Company in a Bankruptcy Case or otherwise,
including, without limitation, a trustee, a litigation trust or estate
representative, including, without limitation, a representative under 11
U.S.C. section 1123(a)(5), and (c) any creditor or committee of creditors or
equity holders seeking or obtaining standing to assert claims of the estate
in a Bankruptcy Case) (each of the foregoing, a " _Bound Party_ ") hereby
expressly waives all fiduciary duties of any Responsible Party that would be
imposed in the absence of this waiver to act or refrain from acting in the
best interest of or to protect or promote the interest of the Rollover
Equityholders, as distinguished from the interest of the Company and all of
its Members as a whole or that absent such waiver, may be implied at law or in
equity or otherwise be owed to a Bound Party.

(d) No Rollover Equityholder or any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to
initiate any action or proceeding against the Purchaser, any Director or
officer of the Company appointed by the Purchaser or any affiliate, officer,
director, employee or agent of any of the foregoing (collectively, the "
_Purchaser Responsible Parties_ ") pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 11.13_ (or
otherwise) that is based on, in whole or in part, a claim of breach of
fiduciary duty or any similar theory unless it gives the Purchaser at least
fifteen (15) days prior written notice (the " _Breach Notice_ ") setting
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis of such claim. Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Purchaser
validly exercises its right to purchase, and in fact purchases, 100% of a
Rollover Equityholders Units pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.4_, such Rollover
Equityholder and any of its Affiliates shall not be entitled to claim or
recover any damages from the Purchaser Responsible Parties based on a claim
of breach of fiduciary duty, lack of good faith or any similar theories
(whether in law or equity), including any claim against any Director or
officer of the Company appointed by the Purchaser for liabilities not
eliminated by reason of _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ or any claim against any of
the Purchaser Responsible Parties based on a breach of any duty not waived
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.6(c)_.

(e) _Permitted Activities_.

 

(i) To the maximum extent permitted by law, except as otherwise expressly
agreed to in a written agreement by a Member, Director, or Affiliate thereof
(including any employment-related agreement between the Company and such
Person), a Member, Director, or Affiliate thereof, in its capacity as such,
may engage in other business activities in which the Company has no interest
for his or its own benefit or for the benefit of a third-party. None of the
Company or any Member shall have any right to any income derived by a Member,
Member, or Affiliate thereof from such business opportunities.

 

(ii) The Members acknowledge that the Purchaser or its Affiliates other than
the Company may seek to acquire, develop and operate lines of business
outside the Company that the Company may also operate or seek to operate
without any liability to any Member under this Agreement and each Member
hereby waives any right to assert any claim based on the
corporate opportunity doctrine, provided that, so long as Koo Rollover
Equityholder holds the Koo Threshold Interest, in connection with any intended
acquisition, development, manufacturing or operation of the cleaning, or
kitting, testing and verification relating to the cleaning, of semiconductor
equipment (but excluding any business that offers such cleaning services as an
ancillary service to any other primary product or service offering that is not
semiconductor cleaning services), the Purchaser shall present to the Board of
Directors any such opportunity to integrate the same into the Company. In the
event that Board of Director rejects such opportunity (or the approval
required pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, if applicable, is not obtained),
the Purchaser shall be entitled to pursue such opportunity outside of the
Company and its Subsidiaries with no further action required of the Purchaser.
In clarification of the foregoing, no line of business of Purchaser or its
Affiliates (other than the Company) in existence as of the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed a corporate opportunity of the Company.

 

(iii) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.6(e)(ii)_, the Members expressly
acknowledge and agree that, except as otherwise expressly agreed to in a
written agreement by a Member or its Affiliates (including any employment-
related or non-competition agreement between the Company and such Person), (A)
each Member and its Affiliates are permitted to have, and may presently or in
the future have (and shall have no duty (contractual, fiduciary or otherwise)
to refrain from having), directly or indirectly, ownership of, investments in
or other business relationships with (including serving on the board of
directors or as managers of) entities and such entities may or may not be
engaged in or competitive with the Business of the Company (an " _Other
Business_ "), (B) each Member and its Affiliates are permitted to, and may,
own, operate, provide advice, services, guidance and other assistance to any
Other Business, (C) each Member and its Affiliates have and may develop
strategic relationships with businesses that are or may be competitive with
or complementary to the Business, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (D)
no Member or its Affiliates will, by virtue of their investment in and
ownership of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (if applicable)
service on the Board of Directors, or their employees or Affiliates service
on any Subsidiarys board of managers or board of directors, be prohibited
from pursuing and engaging in any such activities, (E) no Member or its
Affiliates will be obligated to inform the Board of Directors, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Members of any such

 



19

    

 opportunity, relationship or investment, (F) none of the Members, the
Company, or its Subsidiaries will acquire or be entitled to any interest or
participation in any Other Business or any of the other matters referred to
above as a result of the participation therein by any Member or its
Affiliates, and (G) the involvement of a Member or any of its Affiliates in
any Other Business or any of the other matters referred to above will not
constitute a conflict of interest of a Member or any of its Affiliates with
respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries, or the Members. The provisions of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(e)(iii)_, to the extent that they
restrict, eliminate or otherwise modify duties or liabilities (including
fiduciary duties) of the aforesaid Persons existing at law or in equity, are
agreed by the Company, the Board of Directors, the Members, and any other
Person who is a party to or who is otherwise bound by this Agreement to
replace completely and absolutely such other duties and liabilities (including
fiduciary duties) of such aforesaid Persons to the fullest extent permitted by
law.

 

5.7 _Indemnification_.

(a)  _By the Members_. Each Member shall indemnify, hold harmless and pay all
judgments and claims against the Company and each other Member and its
Affiliates relating to any liability or damage incurred from any third party
claims as a result of such indemnifying Members willful misconduct, fraud,
or breach of the terms of this Agreement.

(b) _By the Company_.

 

(i) The Company, its receiver, or its trustee (in the case of its receiver or
trustee, to the extent of the Companys property) shall indemnify, hold
harmless and pay all judgments and claims against any Director or officer of
the Company (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") relating to any liability or
damage incurred by reason of any act performed or omitted to be performed by
such Indemnified Person in connection with the Business and affairs of the
Company and shall advance reasonable expenses in connection therewith to the
fullest extent that would be permitted by law.

 

(ii) The Company, its receiver, or its trustee (in the case of its receiver or
trustee, to the extent of the Companys property) shall indemnify, hold
harmless and pay all judgments and claims against any Member and its
Affiliates relating to any liability or damage incurred from third party
claims by reason of being a Member, or an Affiliate of a Member, except
to the extent such Member is liable for indemnity under _Section_ __ _
5.7(a)_, and shall advance reasonable expenses in connection therewith.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no indemnity under
_Section_ __ _ 5.7(a)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.7(b)_ shall extend to any claim
related to, or any losses or damages resulting from (A) a claim, action or
demand between or among the Members or (B) an Indemnified Persons or Members
fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or breach of this Agreement.

 



20

    

(c) _Procedures_. In each instance in which indemnity is claimed hereunder,
the party claiming indemnity (the " _Indemnitee_ ") shall give prompt written
notice to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnitor_ ") of
any claim, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnity is
claimed, together with photocopies of any and all letters, pleadings or other
documents in the Indemnitees possession which are alleged to form the
material basis of any such claim or action; provided, that the failure to
provide such notice in a timely fashion shall not affect the Indemnitors
obligations hereunder except to the extent that any delay in providing such
notice results in actual prejudice to the Indemnitor. In any case, the
Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in the defense of any such
claim or action to the extent that the Indemnitor and Indemnitee are not
adverse parties or have adverse interests therein. The Indemnitor shall have
the right to control the defense of any such claim or action by counsel of
the Indemnitors choice, at the Indemnitors sole cost and expense. The
Indemnitee shall have the right to observe any legal proceedings relating to
any such claim or action and to retain its own counsel, it being understood
that the fees and expenses of the Indemnitees counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnitee (unless (i) the defendants in any such claim or action include both
the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee and the Indemnitee shall have been advised
by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to such
Indemnitee that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnitor or (ii) the Indemnitor fails promptly to assume the defense and
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee, in which cases such
reasonable fees and expenses shall be paid by the Indemnitor). The Indemnitor
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect any settlement of any pending or
threatened proceeding unless such settlement is solely monetary in nature.

(d) _Non-Exclusive_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided
by or granted pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, contract, action
of the Board of Directors or pursuant to the direction (however embodied) of
any court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise. The provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall not be deemed to preclude the indemnification of
any Person who is not specified in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ but who the
Company has the power or obligation to indemnify under the provisions of the
Act or otherwise.

(e) _Insurance_. The Board of Directors will cause the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to purchase and maintain appropriate directors and officers
liability insurance on behalf of any Person who is or was serving as a
Director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which shall be
deemed satisfied if Purchaser extends to all directors and officers of the
Company the insurance coverage generally extended to other directors and
officers of Subsidiaries of the Purchaser.

 

(f) _Survival of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_. The
indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant
to, this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to
be a Director, officer, employee or representative of the Company or Member
and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of
such Person. The provisions of this _Section 5.7_ shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

(g)  _Indemnification of Employees and Agents_. The Company may, to the
extent authorized from time to time by the Board of Directors, provide rights
to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to employees, agents
and/or representatives of the Company similar to those conferred in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ to Directors, Officers and Members.

(excluding the Company and its Subsidiaries).

 

6.3 _Company Tax Election_. The Company shall make an election under Treasury
Regulation Section 301.7701-3 (and applicable provisions of state and local

(a) The Members agree to furnish the Company with any information,
representations and forms as shall reasonably be requested by the
Company from time to time to assist it (or any entity in which it holds an
interest) in complying with any applicable law or tax requirements (including
under Section 1471 through 1474 of the Code, any current or future regulations

represent that they have provided the Company with a completed and executed
Form W-9 or an applicable Form W-8 (as appropriate) establishing that the
Member is not subject to, and the Company (and any entity in which it holds an
interest) is not subject as a result of Members interest in the Company to,
any withholding under FATCA. The Member agrees to furnish the Company with any
such Form upon expiration of any prior Form or upon request by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
under this Agreement to any Member such amounts as are required to be withheld
or deducted under the Code, or any provision of applicable Law with respect to
the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld and paid over to the applicable governmental authority, such deducted

 Purchaser), which consent may be given or withheld, or made subject to such
conditions in the Board of Directors (and Purchasers, in the case of a
Transfer by the Rollover Equityholder) absolute discretion; _provided_ , that

__ _ 7.1_ in the same manner as Membership Interests, and Transfer by the

prior to such transaction do not beneficially own a majority of the
outstanding Membership Interests of the surviving Person (or the parent entity
of such surviving Person), (iii) a sale, lease, conveyance or disposition of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis,

Equityholder a statement setting forth their calculation of the applicable
installment of the Exit Price, including their calculation of the Adjusted
EBITDA, Revenue Growth Rate, and EBIDTA Margin for the applicable period
(each, a " _Preliminary Exit Price Statement_ "). If more than one Rollover
Equityholder is entitled to receive the Preliminary Exit Price Statement with
respect to the same twelve (12)-month period for purposes hereof, (1)
Purchaser shall so notify each such Rollover Equityholder, (2) such Rollover
Equityholders shall appoint one of themselves (the " _Representative_ ") as
the agent and attorney-in-fact of each such Rollover Equityholder for purposes
of acting in the name and stead of all of such Rollover Equityholders for
purpose of this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_, and promptly notify Purchaser and the
Company of such appointment, (3) Purchaser and the Company shall be entitled
to conclusively rely on the actions or inaction of and instructions and
communications from the Representative, which shall have binding effect on all
of such Rollover Equityholders, and neither Purchaser nor the Company shall
have any liability to any Rollover Equityholder under this Agreement arising

and (4) each reference to any Rollover Equityholder in this _Section_ __ _

(b) _Exit Price Statement Review_. If the Rollover Equityholder reasonably
believe in good faith that the Preliminary Exit Price Statement is inaccurate
or was not properly prepared in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)_, the
Rollover Equityholder shall so notify Purchaser and the Company no later than
thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Preliminary Exit Price Statement,
setting forth in a Notice of Disagreement its objections to the Preliminary
Exit Price Statement with particularity and the specific changes which the
Rollover Equityholder proposes to be made in order to conform the Preliminary
Exit Price Statement to the terms of _Section_ __ _ 8.7(a)_.

 



36

    

(c) _Preliminary Exit Price Statement Dispute Resolution_. If the Rollover
Equityholder timely notifies Purchaser and the Company of its objection to
the Preliminary Exit Price Statement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
8.7(b)_, and if such Rollover Equityholder and Purchaser are unable to resolve
such dispute through good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days after
the delivery of such Notice of Disagreement, then either the Rollover
Equityholder or Purchaser may require that the Rollover Equityholder and
Purchaser mutually engage and submit such dispute to, and the same shall be
finally resolved in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement by Ernst
and Young LP, or, if such firm declines the representation, an internationally
recognized accounting firm mutually agreed to by the Rollover Equityholder
and Purchaser (the accounting firm ultimately chosen, the " _Accounting
Referee_ "). The Rollover Equityholder, the Company and Purchaser will
cooperate with the Accounting Referee in good faith and in all reasonable
respects as may be requested by the Accounting Referee, including providing
the Accounting Referee reasonable access during normal business hours and on
reasonable advance notice to any relevant personnel, properties, and books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, subject to confidentiality
obligations. The Rollover Equityholder and Purchaser will cause the Accounting
Referee to limit its review and determination to those items set forth on the
Notice of Disagreement that remain in dispute and that relate to accounting
matters, and to deliver a written report containing its calculations of each
such disputed item. The final determination of the Accounting Referee will be
made in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the
definitions of Exit Price). The Accounting Referee will determine the items in
dispute solely based on written submissions made by the Rollover Equityholder
and Purchaser (and their respective representatives) consistent with the
terms hereof (and not by independent review). The Accounting Referee shall
determine and report in writing to the Rollover Equityholder and Purchaser as
to the resolution of all disputed matters and the effect of such
determinations on the Exit Price Statement within thirty (30) days after such
submission or such longer period as the Accounting Referee may reasonably
require, and such determinations shall be final, binding and conclusive on all
parties hereto, absent manifest error, and upon which a judgment may be
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction. None of the Rollover
Equityholder, Purchaser, the Company or their respective representatives will
have any ex parte communications or meetings with the Accounting Referee
concerning the subject matter hereof without the prior written consent of the
other party. The Accounting Referee will not assign a value to any disputed
item that is greater than the greater value for such disputed item claimed by
either party in its written submission or less than the lesser value for such
item claimed by either party in its written submission. The fees and
disbursements of the Accounting Referee shall be borne by the parties
(i.e., the Rollover Equityholder, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on the other
hand) proportionately, based on the amount assigned by each party to items in
dispute, on a net basis, relative to the amount finally determined by the
Accounting Referee (or equally in the event the parties assigned amounts
were, on a net basis, equally far from the amount finally determined by the
Accounting Referee).

 

(d) _Final Exit Price Statement_. The Preliminary Exit Price Statement shall
become the " _Final Exit Price Statement_ " and as such shall become final,
binding and conclusive on the Parties pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.7_
for all purposes of this Agreement and upon which a judgment may be entered by
a court of competent jurisdiction, upon the earliest to occur of the
following:

 



37

    

(i) the mutual acceptance by the Rollover Equityholder and Purchaser of
the Preliminary Exit Price Statement, with such changes thereto, if any, as
may be proposed by the Rollover Equityholder and consented to by Purchaser;

 

(ii) the expiration of the time period ending thirty (30) days after delivery
to the Rollover Equityholder of the Preliminary Exit Price Statement, without
timely written objection by the Rollover Equityholder in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 8.7(b)_; or

 

(iii) the delivery to the Rollover Equityholder and Purchaser by the
Accounting Referee of the final report of its determination of all disputed
matters submitted to the Accounting Referee pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.7(c)_.

(e)  _Payment of Exit Price_. The payment by Purchaser or the Company of the
applicable installment of the Exit Price (or, solely in the case of a Company
Termination Sale, a portion thereof pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_)
to any Rollover Equityholder shall be made within ten (10) Business Days
following the date on which the Preliminary Exit Price Statement becomes the
Final Exit Price Statement.

cause the Company to be dissolved, liquidated, and terminated: 

(a) an election by all of the Members to dissolve the Company;

 

(b) a determination by the Board of Directors to dissolve the Company;

(d) a judicial determination that an event has occurred that makes it
unlawful, impossible or impractical to carry on the Business and affairs of

Any dissolution of the Company other than as provided in this _Section_ __ _
9.2_ shall be a dissolution in contravention of this Agreement.

9.3 _Effect of Dissolution_. The dissolution of the Company shall be effective
on the date on which the event occurs giving rise to the dissolution, but the
Company shall not terminate until it has been wound up, the Company Assets
have been liquidated and/or distributed as provided in _Section_ __ _ 9.4_,

9.4 _Liquidation and Final Distribution Proceeds_.

 

(a) Upon the dissolution of the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, the
Company shall thereafter engage in no further business other than that which
is necessary to wind up the Business and affairs of the Company, and the Board

distributed by the Company in the following order:

 

(i) First, to the payment and discharge of all of the Companys debts and
other liabilities to creditors (including Members that are creditors); and

(ii) The balance, if any, to the Members in accordance with  _Section_ __ _

(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board of
Directors determines that an immediate sale of all or any portion of the

in order to avoid such loss to the extent not then prohibited by the Act, may
either defer liquidation of and withhold from distribution for a reasonable
time any Company Assets except those necessary to satisfy the Companys debts
and obligations, or distribute such Company Assets to the Members in kind;
_provided_ , that with respect to distributions in kind of Company Assets,
the Board of Directors shall give advance written notice of any such in-kind
distribution and, if, after receiving such notice a Member shall determine
that there is a reasonable likelihood that any such distribution in kind
would cause such Member to be in violation of any Law, regulation or order,
such Member shall give written notice thereof to the Board of Directors within
five (5) Business Days following its receipt of the notice of distribution,
and the Member and the Board of Directors shall each use its best efforts to
make alternative arrangements.

 

(b) The Board of Directors, in its reasonable discretion, shall determine
whether any Member or Director shall receive additional compensation for any
services performed pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_.
