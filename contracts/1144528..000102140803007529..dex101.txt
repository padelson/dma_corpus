purposes hereunder. In the event any  such notice of disagreement is timely
provided by the Parent or the  Seller, the Buyer and the Parent and the
Seller shall use their  commercially reasonable efforts for a period of
forty-five (45) days  (or such longer period as they may mutually agree) to
resolve any  disagreements with respect to the calculation of the Closing
Working  Capital. If, at the end of such period, they are unable to resolve 
such disagreements, then PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or such other 
independent accounting firm of recognized national or regional  standing as
may be mutually selected by the Buyer and the Parent and  the Seller) (the
"Accounting Arbitrator") shall resolve any remaining  disagreements. The
Accounting Arbitrator shall determine as promptly  as practicable, but in any
event within forty-five (45) days of the  date on which such dispute is
referred to the Accounting Arbitrator,  based solely on written submissions
forwarded by the Buyer and the  Parent and the Seller to the Accounting
Arbitrator within ten (10)  days following the Accounting Arbitrator\'s
selection, whether or not  the calculation of the Closing Working Capital was
prepared in  accordance with the standards set forth in this(S)2(e) and (only
with  respect to the remaining disagreements submitted to the Accounting 
Arbitrator) whether and to what extent (if any) the Closing Working  Capital
determination requires adjustment. The Accounting Arbitrator  shall allocate
its costs and expenses between the Buyer and the Seller  based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount  not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by  such party. In acting
hereunder, the Accounting Arbitrator shall be  entitled to the privileges and
immunities of arbitrators. The  determination of the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be final, conclusive  and binding on the parties. The date on which the
Closing Working  Capital is finally determined in accordance with this(S)2(e)
is  referred to as the "Determination Date."   (iv) Payment. The "Working
Capital Adjustment Amount," which may  be positive or negative, shall mean,
as applicable (i) if no Interim  Adjustment was   -9-     made pursuant
to(S)2(e)(i), the difference between the Closing Working  Capital and the
Base Working Capital, (ii) if the Buyer paid the  Seller an Interim
Adjustment pursuant to(S)2(e)(i), the difference  between (A) the Closing
Working Capital less the Interim Adjustment  and (B) the Base Working
Capital, or (iii) if the Seller paid the  Buyer an Interim Adjustment
pursuant to(S)2(e)(i), the difference  between (A) the Closing Working
Capital plus the Interim Adjustment,  and (B) the Base Working Capital. The
"Base Working Capital" shall be  negative $29,600,000. If the Closing Working
Capital (as adjusted for  an Interim Adjustment, as applicable, as provided
above) is greater  than the Base Working Capital (such difference, the
"Increase  Amount"), then within five (5) days after the Determination Date,
the  Buyer shall pay to the Seller an amount equal to the Increase Amount, 
together with interest thereon calculated from the Closing Date to the  date
of payment at the Applicable Rate. If the Base Working Capital is  greater
than the Closing Working Capital (as adjusted for an Interim  Adjustment, as
applicable, as provided above) (such difference, the  "Deficit Amount"), then
within five (5) days after the Determination  Date the Parent and Seller
shall pay to the Buyer an amount equal to  the Deficit Amount, together with
interest thereon calculated from the  Closing Date to the date of payment at
the Applicable Rate. As  examples of the operation of this(S) 2(e)(i): (i) if
no Interim  Adjustment was made and if Closing Working Capital is negative 
$27,600,000, then the Buyer shall pay the Seller $2,000,000 as the  Increase
Amount; (ii) if no Interim Adjustment was made and if Closing  Working
Capital is negative $31,600,000, then the Seller shall pay the  Buyer
$2,000,000 as the Deficit Amount; (iii) if the Buyer paid the  Seller an
Interim Adjustment of $1,000,000 pursuant to(S)2(e)(i) and  if Closing
Working Capital is negative $27,600,000, then the Buyer  shall pay the Seller
$1,000,000 as the Increase Amount; (iv) if the  Buyer paid the Seller an
Interim Adjustment of $2,000,000 pursuant  to(S)2(e)(i) and if Closing
Working Capital is negative $29,600,000,  then the Seller shall pay the Buyer
$2,000,000 as the Deficit Amount;  (v) if the Seller paid the Buyer an
Interim Adjustment of $2,000,000  pursuant to(S)2(e)(i) and if Closing
Working Capital is negative  $32,600,000, then the Seller shall pay the Buyer
$1,000,000 as the  Deficit Amount; and (vi) if the Seller paid the Buyer an
Interim  Adjustment of $1,000,000 pursuant to(S)2(e)(i) and if Closing
Working  Capital is negative $28,600,000, then Buyer shall pay the Seller 
$2,000,000 as the Increase Amount.   3. Representations and Warranties

the foregoing, the Parent and the Seller shall not be required to cause the
Company to provide to the Buyer\'s officers, employees, counsel, accountants

the Parent,   -34-    the Seller and the Company may supplement or
amend the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any matter that is necessary to

respect to events occurring prior to the date of this Agreement; provided,
however, that no such supplement or amendment shall be effective or limit or
otherwise affect the rights or remedies of the Buyer in the event that the
Closing does not occur unless such supplement or amendment has previously
been approved by the Buyer in writing in its sole discretion. From time to
time until the Closing Date, the Parent, the Seller and the Company, without
being deemed to be in breach of its representations and warranties under this
Agreement, may supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule with respect to
any matter first existing or occurring after the date hereof which, if
existing or occurring at or prior to such date, would have been required to
be set forth in the Disclosure Schedule. No supplement or amendment to the
Disclosure Schedule shall have any effect for purposes of
determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in (S)7(a) of this
Agreement unless such supplement or amendment is accepted by the Buyer in
writing in its sole discretion, in which case, the Disclosure Schedule shall
be deemed to have been amended accordingly. If the Closing occurs, the Buyer
waives any right or claim it may otherwise have or have had on account of any
matter so disclosed in any such supplement or amendment.   (h) Exclusivity.
Until the earlier of the Closing Date and the date upon which this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to (S)10 hereof, none of the Parent and the Seller
shall (and the Parent and the Seller shall not cause or permit any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries to) (i) solicit, initiate, or encourage the
submission of any proposal or offer from any Person (excluding the Buyer and
its Affiliates) relating to the acquisition of any capital stock or other
voting securities, or any substantial portion of the assets of, any of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (including any acquisition structured as a
merger, consolidation, or share exchange) or (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any information with respect
to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any other manner any effort or
attempt by any Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Until the earlier

exchange. The Parent, the Seller and the Company shall notify the Buyer
immediately if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry, or contact with
respect to any of the foregoing.   (i) Release of Guaranties. On or prior to
the Closing Date, the Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a release from the guarantees set forth on (S)5(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule (the "Guaranties").   (j) Insurance. The Parent and the Seller
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Buyer to be
named as an additional insured on all of the Parent\'s and the Seller\'s
occurrence based insurance policies with respect to the Company relating to
occurrences on or prior to the Closing Date. Subject to the foregoing,
effective 11:59 p.m. on the Closing Date, the Company, its Subsidiaries and
the properties and assets thereof shall cease to be insured under all of the
Parent\'s or the Seller\'s insurance policies and the Buyer shall have no
rights with respect to any such policies. The Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Parent and the Seller to be
named as an additional insured on all of the Buyer\'s and the
Company\'s occurrence based insurance policies with respect to the Company
relating to occurrences following the Closing Date.   -35-     (k) Best

negotiate and execute a definitive loan agreement with BNP Paribas providing
for financing for the Buyer in amounts and under terms and conditions
substantially the same as those contained in the Commitment Letter or, in the
event such financing is not available, to obtain alternative financing from
other lenders under terms and conditions reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer
and the Parent.   (l) Warren Walker 401(k) Plan. The Parent, the Seller and
the Company shall provide to the Buyer for review all documentation and
other information the Buyer reasonably requests regarding the Warren Walker
401(k) plan. If after such review, the Buyer reasonably determines that the
Warren Walker 401(k) plan is not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code,
then the Parent and the Seller shall either rectify such matter or agree to
indemnify the Buyer and the Company from any Adverse Consequences that they
may suffer resulting therefrom.   6. Post-Closing Covenants. The Parties
agree as follows with respect to the period following the Closing.   (a)
General. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall take such further action (including the execution
and delivery of such further instruments and documents) as any other
Party reasonably may request, all at the sole cost and expense of the
requesting Party (unless the requesting Party is entitled to indemnification
therefor under (S)8 below). The Parent, the Seller and the Company
acknowledge and agree that from and after the Closing the Buyer shall be
entitled to possession of all documents, books, records, agreements, and
financial data (collectively, "Records") of any sort relating to the Company
and its Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Parent and the Seller may
retain (i) all Records prepared in connection with the sale of the Company,
including bids received from other parties and analyses relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries and (ii) any Tax Returns, reports or forms, and
the Buyer shall be provided with copies of such Tax Returns, reports or forms
only to the extent that they relate to separate Tax Returns or separate Tax
liability of the Company or any Subsidiary.   (b) Litigation Support. The
Buyer shall make available to the Seller and the Parent (without charge to
the Seller or the Parent other than reimbursement to the Buyer or the Company
of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses) during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice (with the right to examine and duplicate) all books,
records, files, designs, specifications, customer lists, supplier lists,
information, reports, correspondence, literature and other sales materials,
computer software, magnetic media and other data and similar materials
relating to the business of the Company and the Subsidiaries on the Closing
Date (all such materials, the "Books and Records") to the extent necessary to
deal with Tax and insurance matters, the investigation, preparation, conduct
or settlement of or for any dispute, claim, suit, litigation or other
proceeding by or against the Seller (or any of its Affiliates) or any other
matter arising out of the business of the Company or the Subsidiaries prior
to the Closing. The Buyer shall permit the Seller and the Parent and their
respective accountants, counsel, consultants, employees and agents reasonable
access to such personnel of the Buyer during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice as may be necessary to the Seller or the Parent in their
respective review of the Books and Records, and provide such testimony as
shall be reasonably   -36-    requested by the Seller or the Parent, all
without charge to the Seller or the Parent other than reimbursement to the
Buyer or the Company of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection therewith. In the event and for so long as Buyer or the Company or
any Company Subsidiary actively is contesting or defending against any
action, suit, proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim,
or demand in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this
Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to
act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving any of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, each of the Parent and the Seller
will reasonably cooperate with it and its counsel in the contest or defense,
make available their personnel during normal business hours upon reasonable
advance notice, and provide such testimony and access as shall be reasonably
necessary in connection with the contest or defense, all without charge to
the Buyer, the Company or the Company Subsidiary other than reimbursement to
the Parent or the Seller of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection therewith (unless the Buyer, the Company or the Company Subsidiary
is entitled to indemnification therefor under (S)8 below). The Buyer shall
not destroy or otherwise dispose of the Books and Records without first
offering to surrender the Books and Records which are intended to be
destroyed or disposed of to the Seller.   (c) Transition. None of the
Parent, the Seller and the Company shall take any action that is designed or
intended to have the effect of discouraging any lessor, licensor, customer,
supplier, or other business associate of any of the Company and its
Subsidiaries from maintaining the same business relationships with the
Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing as it maintained with the
Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. Each of the Parent, the
Seller and the Company shall refer all customer inquiries relating to the
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Buyer from and after
the Closing.   (d) Confidentiality. From and after the Closing for a period
of four years, each of the Parent and the Seller shall treat and hold as such
all of the Confidential Information and refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement. In the
event that any of the Parent or the Seller is requested or required (by oral
question or request for information or documents in any legal proceeding,
interrogatory, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to
disclose any Confidential Information, the Parent or the Seller shall notify
the Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that the Buyer may seek
an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of
this (S)6(d). If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, either the Parent or the Seller is, on the advice of
counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information, the Parent or
the Seller may disclose the Confidential Information; provided, however, that
the disclosing party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain,
at the request and sole cost of the Buyer, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment shall be accorded to such portion of the Confidential
Information required to be disclosed as the Buyer shall designate. The
foregoing provisions shall not apply to any Confidential Information which
(i) is generally available to the public immediately prior to the time of
disclosure, or (ii) is or becomes available to the Parent, the Seller or the
Company on a non-confidential basis from a third party, provided that to the
Knowledge of the Parent, the Seller and the Company, such party was not
prohibited from disclosing such information to the Parent, the Seller or the
Company, as the case may be. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Parent and the Seller may use the
Confidential Information   -37-    for Tax reporting and in connection
with any government filing and financial reporting without complying with
this (S)6(d).   (e) Covenant Not to Compete. For a period of four (4) years
from and after the Closing Date, neither the Parent nor the Seller shall
engage directly or indirectly in any business that any of the Company and
its Subsidiaries conducts as of the Closing Date in any geographic area in
which any of the Company and its Subsidiaries conducts that business as of
the Closing Date (a "Competitive Business"); provided, however, that (i) the
Parent and the Seller may own no more than 5% of the outstanding stock of any
publicly traded corporation engaged in a Competitive Business, (ii) the
Parent and the Seller shall not be prohibited from acquiring another Person,
so long as such Person\'s revenue from a Competitive Business in the fiscal
year immediately preceding such acquisition is less than 15% of such
Person\'s total annual revenue in such fiscal year and Parent and Seller use
commercially reasonable efforts to divest such Competitive Business as
promptly as practicable after such acquisition, and (iii) the Parent and the
Seller shall not be prohibited from acquiring as a creditor in bankruptcy or
otherwise than by a voluntary investment decision a Person engaged in a
Competitive Business so long as Parent and Seller use commercially reasonable
efforts to divest such Competitive Business as promptly as practicable after
such acquisition. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision of this (S)6(e) is invalid or
unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with
a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest
to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or
provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the
expiration of the time within which the judgment may be appealed.   (f) Use
of Names; Removal. The Buyer acknowledges that following the Closing, subject
to the transition provisions set forth in this (S)6(f), neither it nor its
affiliates, nor the Company or any of the Subsidiaries will be entitled to
use the name "Aramark" and any variations and derivations thereof, including
any logo, trademark or design containing such name (the "Prohibited Names and
Marks"). Accordingly, promptly following the Closing, the Buyer shall (i)
cause each of the Company and the Subsidiaries (as appropriate) to change its
legal name to remove therefrom the name "Aramark" or any variations and
derivations thereof and (ii) cause the destruction, disposal and/or
replacement of stationery, business cards, signage and similar assets of the
Company and the Subsidiaries so to avoid the use of the Prohibited Names
and Marks. In addition, as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
within six months following the Closing, the Buyer shall cause to be removed
the Prohibited Names and Marks from all of the assets of the Company and
the Subsidiaries, and will not thereafter make any use whatsoever of such
names, marks, and logos.   (g) Employee Benefits.   (i) In General. As of
the Closing Date, the Company and its  Subsidiaries shall cease to be
participating employers under the  Employee Benefit Plans that are sponsored
or maintained by the  Parent or the Seller (the "Parent Plans") and as of the
Closing  Date the Company Employees shall cease to be active participants 
under such Parent Plans. Following the Closing Date, the   -38-    
Company or its Subsidiaries shall be solely responsible for all  obligations
and liabilities under the Employee Benefits Plans  that are sponsored or
maintained by the Company or its  Subsidiaries (and none of Parent, Seller or
their respective  Affiliates shall have any obligations or liabilities with
respect  thereto). From the Closing Date through December 31, 2003 (unless 
the Buyer modifies employee benefits earlier as provided below),  the Buyer
shall cause the Company to provide employees of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries who are actively employed by the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date (or who  are not actively at work due to
illness, disability or approved  leave of absence) (collectively, "Company
Employees") with  employee benefits (excluding stock options, other equity
based  benefits, any benefits provided under any Transaction Agreement  (as
defined in (S)6(g)(iii)) and benefits provided with respect  to any non-
qualified deferred compensation plan or any stock unit  or similar
supplemental retirement plan) that are substantially  comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to Company  Employees under the Employee Benefit
Plans immediately prior to  the Closing Date. Company Employees shall be
credited for their  length of service with the Company and its Affiliates for
all  purposes (other than for purposes of benefit accrual under any  defined
benefit pension plan) under any plan, policy or  arrangement made available
to Company Employees by the Buyer or  its Affiliates after the Closing Date
to the same extent such  service would have been credited under the
applicable Employee  Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither  Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates shall assume any Liability with  respect to the ARAMARK
Stock Unit Retirement Plan or any other  deferred compensation, excess
benefit, or other non-qualified  retirement plan or program maintained by the
Seller or any of its  Affiliates under which any Company Employee may have
accrued any  benefits with respect to any period ending on or prior to the 
Closing Date. Any pre-existing condition clause in any Employee  Welfare
Benefit Plan offered or made available to Company  Employees by Buyer or any
of its Affiliates shall be waived for  Company Employees to the extent such
pre-existing condition would  have been or was waived under the applicable
Employee Benefit  Plan in which the Company Employee participated prior to
the  Closing Date, and Buyer shall credit Company Employees with any 
amounts paid under the Employee Welfare Benefit Plans in which  such Company
Employees were participating immediately prior to  the Closing Date towards
satisfaction of the applicable  deductible amounts and co-payment obligations
under the Employee  Welfare Benefit Plans of Buyer and its Affiliates in
which such  Company Employees participate for the plan year in which the 
Closing Date occurs. The Buyer may, in its sole discretion and  without the
consent of the Seller or Parent, modify employee  benefits provided to
Company Employees, provided that employee  benefits provided generally to
Company Employees and employees of  the Buyer are substantially comparable in
the aggregate.   (ii) 401(k) Plans.   (A) Parent and the Seller shall take
all actions  necessary or appropriate to cause the account balances of  all
Company Employees   -39-     under the ARAMARK Hourly 401(k) Plan (the
"Hourly 401(k)  Plan") and the ARAMARK Retirement Savings Plan for Salaried 
Employees (the "RSP", and together with the Hourly 401(k)  Plan, the "ARAMARK
401(k) Plans") to be fully vested as of  the Closing Date.   (B) Effective
as of the Closing Date, Parent shall  cause the trustees of each of the
ARAMARK 401(k) Plans to  segregate the assets of such ARAMARK 401(k) Plan 
representing the full account balances (including loans) of  Company
Employees as of the Closing Date. The manner in  which the account balances
of Company Employees under the  ARAMARK 401(k) Plans are invested shall not
be affected by  such segregation of assets.   (C) Not later than the
Closing Date, Buyer shall  establish or designate a 401(k) Plan for the
benefit of  Company Employees (the "Buyer 401(k) Plan"), that is  intended
to be a qualified plan under Section 401(a) of the  Code, and that is subject
to a current favorable  determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service  covering the plan and all amendments for which the remedial 
amendment period (as defined in Section 401(b) of the Code  and applicable
regulations) has expired. As soon as  administratively practicable following
the earlier of (x)  the delivery to Parent of a favorable determination
letter  from the Internal Revenue Service regarding the qualified  status of
the Buyer 401(k) Plan as amended to the date of  transfer, or (y) the
delivery to Parent of the current  favorable determination letter with
respect to the Buyer  401(k) Plan and a representation of the Buyer that the
Buyer  does not know of any reason that as of the Initial Transfer  Date (as
defined in Section 6(g)(ii)(D)) such favorable  determination letter should
be revoked or suspended (and  Buyer shall indemnify the Parent, Seller and
their  respective Affiliates for any Adverse Consequences that they  may
suffer in the event that the Buyer 401(k) Plan is not  qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code as of the Initial  Transfer Date), Parent shall
cause the trustees of the  ARAMARK 401(k) Plans to transfer, in accordance
with Code  Section 414(l), the full account balances (including  outstanding
loans) of Company Employees under the ARAMARK  401(k) Plans (which account
balances will have been credited  with appropriate earnings attributable to
the period from  the Closing Date to the date immediately prior to the date 
of transfer described herein), reduced by any benefit or  withdrawal payments
in respect of Company Employees  occurring during the period from the Closing
Date to the  date immediately prior to the date of transfer described 
herein, to the appropriate trustee as designated by Buyer  under the trust
agreement forming a part of the Buyer 401(k)  Plan (the "Initial Transfer").
Such assets shall be  transferred in cash (or such other form as may be
agreed by  Buyer and Parent), except for shares of Parent\'s common  stock
and any participant loans allocated to the accounts of  Company Employees on
the date of transfer described herein,  each of which shall be transferred
in   -40-     kind. Shares of Parent common stock so transferred shall
be  Class B shares.   (D) In consideration for the Initial Transfer of 
assets described herein, Buyer shall, effective as of the  date of such
Initial Transfer (the "Initial Transfer Date"),  assume all of the
obligations of Parent and any of its  Affiliates in respect of the account
balances (including  outstanding loans) of Company Employees under the
ARAMARK  401(k) Plans (exclusive of any portion of such account  balances
which are distributed or withdrawn prior to the  Initial Transfer Date) on or
prior to the Closing Date.  Except as set forth in clause (G) below, neither
Buyer nor  any of its Affiliates shall assume any other obligations  arising
under or attributable to the ARAMARK 401(k) Plans.   (E) Parent shall take
all actions necessary or  appropriate to cause to be made employer matching 
contributions under the RSP in respect of the plan year in  which the Closing
Date occurs (the "Current Plan Year") on  behalf of Company Employees who
made elective pre-tax salary  deferrals under the RSP during the Current Plan
Year and  whose accounts are transferred to the Buyer 401(k) Plan  pursuant
to the Initial Transfer. Such employer matching  contributions shall be made
(i) in respect of such portion  of the Current Plan Year that has elapsed
through the  Closing Date, taking into account eligible elective pre-tax 
salary deferrals made by Company Employees under the RSP  through the Closing
Date (subject to applicable service  requirements, but notwithstanding any
provision of the RSP  that requires participants to be employees of the
Parent or  its applicable Affiliates eligible to make contributions  under
the plan on the last day of the Current Plan Year in  order to be eligible to
receive employer matching  contributions), (ii) at the time such employer
matching  contributions are made, generally, to other participants\' 
accounts under the RSP, and (iii) at the rate generally  applicable to other
participants who are eligible for  employer matching contributions under the
RSP. Such employer  matching contributions shall be made, at Parent\'s
election,  in cash (and invested in a short-term, interest bearing  account
under the plan) or in shares of Parent common stock  (and held under the
plan\'s Parent stock fund).   Parent shall take all actions necessary or
appropriate  to cause to be made employer matching contributions under  the
Hourly 401(k) Plan, in accordance with its terms, in  respect of the Current
Plan Year on behalf of Company  Employees who made elective pre-tax salary
deferrals during  the Current Plan Year and whose accounts are transferred
to  the Buyer 401(k) Plan. Such employer matching contributions  shall only
be made in respect of periods of service during  the Current Plan Year ending
prior to the Closing Date, and  shall only be made on behalf of such Company
Employees who  are eligible to receive such employer matching 
contributions, in accordance with the terms of the Hourly  401(k) Plan.  
-41-     (F) To the extent any employer matching contributions  described
in clause (E) above are made after the Initial  Transfer Date, as soon as
administratively practicable  following the date such contributions are made,
Parent shall  cause the trustee of the relevant plan to transfer, in 
accordance with Code Section 414(l), the account balances of  Company
Employees attributable to such employer matching  contributions (credited
with appropriate earnings, if any,  attributable to the period from the date
of contribution to  the date immediately prior to the date of transfer
described  herein), reduced by any benefit payments in respect of  Company
Employees occurring during the period from the date  of contribution to the
date immediately prior to the date of  transfer described herein, to the
appropriate trustee as  designated by Buyer under the trust agreement forming
a part  of the Buyer 401(k) Plan. Such assets shall be transferred  in cash
or in kind in the form of Class B shares of Parent  common stock, as
applicable.   (G) In consideration for the subsequent transfer of  assets,
if any, described in clause (F) above (the  "Subsequent Transfer"), Buyer
shall, effective as of the  date of such subsequent transfer (the "Subsequent
Transfer  Date"), assume all of the obligations of Parent and any of  its
Affiliates in respect of such account balances of  Company Employees
attributable to such employer matching  contributions under the relevant plan
(exclusive of any  portion of such account balances which are distributed
prior  to the Subsequent Transfer Date). Except as set forth in  clause (D)
above, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates  shall assume any other
obligations arising under or  attributable to the ARAMARK 401(k) Plans.  
(H) For a period of at least 12 months following the  Initial Transfer Date,
the shares of Parent common stock  transferred to the Buyer 401(k) Plan
pursuant to the Initial  Transfer and any Subsequent Transfer shall be held
as a  separate investment fund under the Buyer 401(k) Plan.  Affected
Company Employees shall be permitted at any time to  direct the transfer of
up to 100% of their Parent stock fund  accounts under the Buyer 401(k) Plan
out of (but not into)  such Parent stock fund. Following such 12-month
period, in  the event a determination is made to reduce or eliminate the 
Parent stock fund under the Buyer 401(k) Plan, Buyer shall  take such actions
as are necessary or appropriate to ensure  the orderly and periodic
liquidation of such shares of  Parent common stock as remain in such fund.
Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement, in no event shall
any  Company Employee be eligible to make any additional  contribution to
the Parent stock fund with respect to any  period following the Closing
Date.   (I) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to  cause Company
Employees to be eligible to participate in the  Buyer 401(k) Plan commencing
as of the day immediately  following the Closing Date (or as   -42-    
soon as administratively practicable thereafter), to the  extent otherwise
consistent with such plan\'s eligibility  requirements.   (iii) Transaction
Agreements. Parent shall be responsible  for making all payments (including
without limitation all  transition bonus and management incentive bonus
payments) and  providing all benefits that may be due or payable under or
with  respect to those certain letters agreements listed on (S)4(g)(xv)  of
the Disclosure Schedule (the "Transaction Agreements");  provided, however,
that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer  and the Company shall be
responsible for providing any severance  obligations that may become due or
payable pursuant to any  Transaction Agreement following the Closing Date in
the event  that the Company or the Buyer terminates a listed employee for 
reasons other than for Cause (as defined in the Transaction  Agreements) or
due to such employee\'s death or permanent  disability (and none of Parent,
Seller or their respective  Affiliates shall have any liability with respect
thereto).   (h) Continuity of Employment.   (i) The parties intend that
there be continuity of  employment with respect to the employees of the
Company  immediately following the Closing. The Buyer, the Parent and the 
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that  all persons
who were employed by the Company on the day  immediately preceding the
Closing Date will be employed by the  Company on and immediately after the
Closing.   (ii) It is agreed that nothing in this Agreement shall be 
construed to confer upon any Company Employee any right to  continued
employment with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  following the
Closing, nor shall anything herein be construed to  interfere with the right
of Buyer, the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries to terminate the employment
of any such Company  Employee at any time following the Closing, with or
without  cause, or restrict any of the Buyer, the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries, in the exercise of its independent business  judgment in
modifying any of the terms and conditions of the  employment of any such
Company Employee following the Closing.  Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, shall be construed  to confer upon any Company Employee (or any
other current or  former employee of the Seller, the Company or any of its 
Subsidiaries), any rights or remedies under or by reason of this 
Agreement.   (iii) Neither the Buyer nor the Company shall, at any time 
prior to 90 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant  closing" or
"mass layoff", as those terms are defined in the WARN  Act, affecting in
whole or in part any site of employment,  facility, operating unit or
employee, except in compliance with  the WARN Act. The Seller shall notify
the Buyer prior to the  Closing of any layoffs that have occurred in the
90-day period  prior to the Closing Date.   (i) Insurance Matters.  
-43-     (i) On the Closing Date, the Buyer shall have in place 
liability insurance in such amounts and for such coverages as are  in the
reasonable business judgment of the Buyer prudent.   (ii) Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges and agrees  that the Seller (or any of its
Affiliates) and their agents shall  maintain exclusive control of all claim
management and  settlements with Seller\'s insurance carriers relating to
the  Company and the Subsidiaries for all periods prior to the Closing  Date
for all insurable matters for which indemnification has been  sought pursuant
to (S)8(b); provided that the Parties agree that  claims involving the
student accident program (as described  below) are specifically excluded from
indemnification  under (S)8(b). The Company operates a self-insured student 
accident program that is administered by Arthur J. Gallagher and  supplements
the Company\'s general liability insurance plan. The  Company\'s student
accident plan provides compensation when  children are injured while in the
Company\'s care regardless of  fault. If the medical costs are less than
$200, the Company will  pay for the costs. If the costs exceed $200, the
Company asks  that the claim be submitted to the parent\'s medical
insurance  plan and the Company will pay any deductibles or co-pays so that 
the parent is not out-of-pocket any money. The maximum benefit  available
under the plan is $10,000 and the plan also has a  $5,000 death benefit.  
(iii) Upon request by the Seller, the Buyer agrees to  cooperate reasonably
with the Seller and to use commercially  reasonable efforts to provide Seller
with prompt written notice  regarding any matter which could reasonably be
expected to lead  to an insured claim of the Company or any Subsidiary under
the  Seller\'s insurance programs for a period prior to the Closing.   (iv)
In the event of any written notice from the Seller of  a pending insurance
claim for a period prior to the Closing, the  Buyer shall provide reasonable
cooperation to the Seller and  shall make available to the Seller during
normal business hours  and upon reasonable notice (consistent with the terms
of (S)6(b)  above), all Books and Records and personnel of the Buyer, the 
Company and the Subsidiaries which are reasonably necessary for  the Seller
to deal with the investigation, adjudication and  settlement of any such
pending insurance claims.   (v) Upon request by the Seller, the Buyer agrees
to (A)  designate and make available to the Seller an officer of the 
Company who shall be responsible for making an employee of the  Company
available to assist the Seller and the Parent in  responding to claims
related inquiries related to, and (B)  cooperate with the Seller with respect
to, insurance claims  procedures and policies (including claims management)
existing  under the Seller\'s insurance programs which relate to the
Company  or any Subsidiary with dates of occurrence prior to the Closing 
Date.   (vi) From and after the Closing, the Seller may, in its  sole
discretion and without the consent of the Company, make  changes to any of
its insurance   -44-     programs that relate to Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including  without limitation changes relating to insurance
coverage).   (vii) From and for ninety days after the Closing, the Buyer 
shall cause the Company to continue to provide employees of the  Company and
its Subsidiaries who are not actively at work as a  result of a work-related
disability with a date of occurrence  prior to the Closing Date with
compensation that is substantially  comparable to that provided immediately
prior to the onset of  such work-related disability and consistent with the
Company\'s  salary continuation program in effect immediately prior to the 
Closing.   (viii) The Buyer shall promptly pay to the Parent the amount  of
any proceeds or recovery received by the Company or any  Subsidiary which
resulted from any settlement or subrogation of  any insurance claim relating
to the Company or any Subsidiary  with dates of occurrence prior to the
Closing Date concerning  matters for which the Parent and the Parent\'s
insurance carriers  are responsible.   (ix) From and after the Closing,
with respect to the  Company and its Subsidiaries, the Buyer shall cause the
Company  to (A) continue to report, process and manage worker compensation 
claims with dates of occurrence prior to the Closing Date in  accordance with
the policies and procedures established by the  Parent and in effect
immediately prior to Closing, and (B) retain  the third party
administrator(s) and workers compensation  insurance provider(s) used by the
Parent immediately prior to  Closing with respect to worker compensation
claims with dates of  occurrence prior to the Closing Date.   (j) Accrued
Vacation/Sick Pay Reconciliation. With respect to salaried employees of the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries who cease to be employed by the Company or
one of its Subsidiaries for any reason from the Closing Date through
September 30, 2003, the Seller agrees to reimburse the Buyer for that portion
of the accrued vacation/sick pay compensation paid to such employees that is
attributable to the period prior to the Closing Date (based upon prorating
vacation/sick pay compensation evenly over the course of the fiscal year
ending September 30, 2003). The Seller shall pay such reimbursement to the
Buyer within five (5) business days after receipt of written notice from the
Buyer of the amount owed, together with the computation thereof in reasonable
detail.   (k) Buyer Financial Statements. Promptly after
becoming available, the Buyer shall deliver to the Seller copies of the
audited divisional combined balance sheet of the Division as of December 31,
2002, together with the related audited divisional combined statement of
income, retained earnings and cash flows for the year then ended, reported on
without qualification by the Buyer\'s independent certified public
accountants (the "2002 Buyer Financial Statements"). The 2002 Buyer Financial
Statements will be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise
provided in the 2002 Buyer Financial Statements and the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis throughout the period covered thereby and will
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Division as of such date and the results of operations of the Division for
such period.   -45-     7. Conditions to Obligation to Close.   (a)

against any other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under this  (S)8, then the
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each  Indemnifying Party thereof in
writing describing the Third Party  Claim in reasonable detail; provided,
however, that no delay on  the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying  
-51-     any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party
from  any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent)  the
Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced (except the  Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for any expenses incurred  by the Indemnified Party in
investigating or defending the Third  Party Claim during the period in which
the Indemnified Party has  not given notice of such Third Party Claim to the
Indemnifying  Party).   (ii) Any Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
defend  the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel  of
its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so  long as (A)
the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party  in writing within
fifteen days after the Indemnified Party has  given notice of the Third Party
Claim that the Indemnifying Party  will assume the defense of the Indemnified
Party from and against  any Adverse Consequences of the Third Party Claim,
(B) the Third  Party Claim involves only money damages that would not have
a  material adverse effect on the business, financial condition or 
operations of Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including the Company  and its
Subsidiaries) taken as a whole and does not seek an  injunction or other
equitable relief, and (C) the Indemnifying  Party conducts the defense of the
Third Party Claim actively and  diligently.   (iii) So long as the
Indemnifying Party is conducting the  defense of the Third Party Claim in
accordance with (S)8(d)(ii)  above, (A) the Indemnified Party may retain
separate co-counsel  at its sole cost and expense and participate in the
defense of  the Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party will not
consent  to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with 
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written  consent of the
Indemnifying Party, and (C) the Indemnifying Party  will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any  settlement with respect to the Third
Party Claim without the  prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (not
to be  withheld unreasonably) unless the judgment or proposed settlement 
involves only the payment of money damages by one or more of the 
Indemnifying Parties and contains a full and complete release in  favor of
all Indemnified Parties.   (iv) In the event any of the conditions in
(S)8(d)(ii)  above is or becomes unsatisfied, however, (A) the Indemnified 
Party may defend the Third Party Claim in any manner it  reasonably may deem
appropriate; provided that the Indemnified  Party\'s counsel is reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying  Party and that the Indemnified Party will not
consent to the  entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without
the  prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be 
unreasonably withheld) and (B) the Indemnifying Parties will  remain
responsible for any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified  Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, or caused by the  Third Party Claim to the
fullest extent provided in this (S)8.   (e) Matters Involving Environmental
Claims. In addition to any other limitations under this Agreement that may
apply, with respect to any claim for indemnification   -52-    asserted
under (S)8(b) above regarding any breach of any representation or warranty in
(S)4(x) above, Parent and Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify:  
(i) Unless the Adverse Consequences arise out of (A) a  Third Party Claim
that is not instigated or encouraged by any  Buyer Indemnified Party, or (B)
a condition discovered in the  ordinary course of business; and   (ii) For
any costs or expenses incurred by or on behalf of  the Buyer Indemnified
Party to implement measures with respect to  the condition giving rise to
such claim for indemnification, to  the extent such measures are not (A)
reasonably cost-effective  for addressing such condition, (B) required by
applicable  Environmental Law in effect as of the Closing Date or by any 
environmental regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the  matter acting
pursuant to such Environmental Law, and (C)  reasonably necessary for the
continued use of the property at  issue as it was used immediately prior to
the Closing Date; and   (iii) For any costs to investigate, remediate, or
otherwise  address mold that is present or suspected at any Real Property, 
unless such costs comply with the foregoing subparagraphs (i) and  (ii)(C)
and are Qualified Mold Remediation Costs. For purposes of  this Agreement,
Qualified Mold Remediation Costs shall mean:  costs to investigate (including
the costs of the environmental  consultant referred to in this paragraph),
remediate, or  otherwise address mold in or at a building or equipment at
any  Real Property, which costs prior to being incurred have been  reviewed
and approved by an independent environmental consultant  (which consultant
has been mutually agreed upon by Buyer and  Seller and which under no
circumstances shall perform, or have  any interest in any entity that
performs, any investigation,  remediation, or other addressing of mold that
it reviews or  approves) as reasonably necessary and cost-effective to
attain  applicable legal standards (or, in the absence of such standards, 
levels generally recognized by indoor air quality experts as  reasonably
acceptable in light of the use of the Real Property at  issue), subject to
the following: (A) Buyer shall in every case  be responsible for the first
$12,000 of Qualified Mold  Remediation Costs for any Real Property; (B)
Seller shall be  responsible for 100% of Qualified Mold Remediation Costs, if
any,  in excess of the Qualified Mold Remediation Costs referred to in  the
foregoing clause (A) to the extent they are incurred within  six months after
the Closing Date or up to an aggregate of  $500,000, whichever comes first;
and (C) Qualified Mold  Remediation Costs other than those referred to in the
foregoing  clauses (A) and (B) which are incurred within twelve months of 
the date Seller no longer is obligated to pay 100% of Qualified  Mold
Remediation Costs pursuant to the foregoing clause (B) shall  be shared
equally by Buyer and Seller. Seller shall have no  further obligation to
Buyer with respect to Qualified Mold  Remediation Costs or any other costs to
investigate, remediate,  or otherwise address mold that is present or
suspected at any  Real Property except as provided in this subparagraph
(iii).  Payments of Qualified Mold Remediation Costs shall not be subject 
to, or included in calculating, any Deductible Amounts or  ceilings provided
for in (S)8(b) and (c).   -53-     Notwithstanding any provision of
(S)8(e) above that may be construed to the contrary, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties (A) shall control any measures taken to address conditions at or
emanating from any Owned Real Property or Leased Real Property that are the
subject of a claim for indemnification asserted under (S)8(b) above regarding
any breach of any representation or warranty in (S)4(x) above, using
consultants, contractors and advisors reasonably acceptable to the Parent and
the Seller, and (B) without limiting clause (A) above, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties will reasonably consult with Seller regarding any proposed remedy,
and will use commercially reasonable efforts to allow Seller to evaluate any
proposed claim (such efforts to include providing the Seller with
reasonable access to any property in the possession or control of any Buyer
Indemnified Party and to any relevant data or environmental reports and
correspondence with government agencies, and allowing the Seller to have a
reasonable opportunity to provide input regarding the handling of such
matter).   (f) Determination of Adverse Consequences. The amount of
any Adverse Consequences with respect to any claim for indemnification
hereunder shall be determined net of any insurance proceeds actually received
by the Indemnified Party with respect to such claims; provided, however, that
the Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to seek insurance coverage.
The amount of any Adverse Consequences with respect to any claim for
indemnification hereunder shall be determined net of any Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim; provided,
however, that any Tax benefit resulting from such a claim shall be determined
only after applying all other deductions and losses, including any net
operating loss carryforwards, available to the Indemnified Party, as if the
Tax benefit arising from such claim did not exist (for example, all existing
net operating loss carryforwards would have to be exhausted before a "Tax
benefit" would be actually realized from such a claim) and provided further
that creating or increasing a net operating loss carryforward shall be deemed
not to create a Tax benefit. In addition, the amount of Adverse Consequences
for any claim for indemnification hereunder shall include interest at the
Applicable Rate from the date that is five (5) days after the time the
Indemnified Party paid such amount to a third party through and including the
date of payment of such claim by the Indemnifying Party. All indemnification
payments under this (S)8 shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase
Price.   (g) Other Indemnification Provisions. The Parties agree that, from
and after the Closing, the remedies provided in this (S)8 and (S)11(o)
are the exclusive remedies for any breach of representation, warranty or
covenant under this Agreement, other than claims based upon fraud.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that a party
waives the satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in (S)7(a) or (b),
as the case may be, which conditions were not satisfied due to one or more
matters that were specifically disclosed in writing to such waiving party
prior to the Closing, then no other party shall have any liability hereunder
as an Indemnifying Party for such matter or matters to the extent so
disclosed. The Parent and the Seller each hereby waives, and acknowledges and
agrees that it shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to
exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other
right or remedy against the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with
any indemnification obligation or for any other liability for which the
Parent or the Seller shall be responsible in connection with this
Agreement.   -54-     9. Tax Matters. The following provisions shall
govern the allocation of responsibility as between the Buyer and the Parent
and the Seller for certain Tax matters following the Closing Date:   (a)
Tax Indemnities.   (i) From and after the Closing Date, without
duplication  and subject to (S)8 hereof (but without regard to the
limitations  in (S)8(b)(i)(A) and (B) hereof), the Parent and the Seller
shall  indemnify the Buyer and the Company and their Affiliates against  all
Taxes (including reasonable attorneys\' and accountants\' fees  and other
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in  connection therewith, but
reduced by any Tax benefit that the  Buyer, the Company or their Affiliates
realize as a result of the  payment (or the adjustment giving rise to the
payment) of any  such Taxes) imposed on or payable by the Company or any of
its  Subsidiaries (A) with respect to any taxable period or portion  thereof
that ends on or before the Closing Date (including any  Taxes allocated to
such period under (S)9(a)(iv) hereof); (B)  under Treasury Regulation
(S)1.1502-6 (or any similar provision  of state, local or foreign law) by
reason of the Company or any  of its Subsidiaries being included in any
consolidated,  affiliated, combined or unitary or other similar group of
which  the Parent is the common parent at any time on or before the  Closing
Date, (C) pursuant to any contract or agreement with any  third party for
indemnification of Taxes or (D) without  duplication, any Taxes arising from
a breach of representation  contained in (S)4(j); other than any Taxes
included as a  liability in Closing Working Capital. No indemnity shall be 
provided under this Agreement for any Taxes resulting from any  transaction
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries occurring  after the Closing Date
or on the Closing Date after the Closing  that is not in the Ordinary Course
of Business.   (ii) From and after the Closing Date, without duplication, 
the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, indemnify the  Parent and
its Affiliates against all Taxes (including reasonable  attorneys\' and
accountants\' fees and other reasonable  out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection therewith) imposed  on the Company and its Subsidiaries, which
Taxes are not subject  to indemnification pursuant to (S)9(a)(i), including
Taxes (A)  resulting from any transaction of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries occurring after the Closing Date or on the Closing  Date after
the Closing that is not in the Ordinary Course of  Business, (B) with respect
to any taxable period or portion  thereof that begins after the Closing Date
(including any Taxes  allocated to such period under (S)9(a)(iv) hereof) or
(C)  included as a liability in Closing Working Capital.   (iii) Payment by
the indemnitor of any amount due under  this (S)9 shall be made within ten
days following written notice  by the indemnitee that payment of such amounts
to the appropriate  Tax Authority is due, provided that the indemnitor shall
not be  required to make any payment earlier than two days before it is  due
to the appropriate Tax Authority. If the Parent receives an  assessment or
other notice of Taxes due with respect to the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries for any period for which the  Parent is not responsible, in
whole or in   -55-     part, pursuant to (S)9(a)(i), then the Buyer
shall pay such Tax,  or if the Parent pays such Tax, then the Buyer or the
Company  shall pay to the Parent, in accordance with the first sentence of 
this (S)9(a)(iii), the amount of such Tax for which the Parent is  not
responsible. In the case of a Tax that is contested in  accordance with the
provisions of (S)9(c), payment of the Tax to  the appropriate Tax Authority
will not be considered to be due  earlier than the date a final determination
to such effect is  made by the appropriate Tax Authority or court. Final 
determination shall have the meaning as set forth in (S)1313(a)  of the
Code.   (i) The Parent and the Buyer shall, to the extent  permitted by
applicable law and except as otherwise provided  herein, elect with the
relevant Tax Authority to close the  taxable period of the Company and its
Subsidiaries at the end of  the day on the Closing Date. For purposes of this
Agreement, in  the case of any Tax that is imposed on a periodic basis and
is  payable for a taxable period that begins before the Closing Date  and
ends after the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes which  is payable for
the portion of such taxable period ending on the  Closing Date shall be (A)
in the case of any Tax other than a Tax  based upon or measured by income or
receipts, the amount of such  Tax for the entire taxable period (or, in the
case of such Taxes  determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Tax
for the  immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the 
numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of such  taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of  which is the number
of days in the entire taxable period and (B)  in the case of a Tax based upon
or measured by income or  receipts, the amount which would be payable if the
relevant  taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any credit or refund 
resulting from an overpayment of Taxes shall be prorated based  upon the
method employed in the immediately preceding sentence.  In the case of any
Tax based upon or measured by capital  (including net worth or long-term
debt) or intangibles, any  amount thereof required to be allocated under this
(S)9(a)(iv)  shall be computed by reference to the level of such items on
the  Closing Date. The taxable period of any partnership or other  pass-
through entity in which the Company or any Subsidiary is a  partner or other
beneficial interest holder shall be deemed to  terminate on the Closing Date.
All determinations necessary to  effect the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner  consistent with prior practice of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries.   (b) Refunds and Tax Benefits.   (i) Subject to
(S)9(b)(ii), the Buyer shall promptly pay  to the Parent the amount of any
refund or credit or offset  (including any interest paid or credited or any
offset allowed  with respect thereto but reduced by any Taxes that the Buyer,
the  Company or any Subsidiary shall be required to pay with respect 
thereto) received or used, in the case of a credit or offset, by  the Buyer,
the Company or any subsidiary of Taxes (A) relating to  taxable periods or
portions thereof ending on or before the  Closing Date (including any Taxes
allocated to such period under  (S)9(a)(iv) hereof) or (B) attributable to an
amount paid by the  Parent or the Seller under (S)9(a) hereof, other than any
refund  of Taxes included as an asset in Closing   -56-     Working
Capital. The amount of any refunds or credits or offsets  (including any
interest paid or credited with respect thereto)  received by Buyer, the
Company or any Subsidiary shall be for the  account of the Buyer if the
refund, credit or offset is of Taxes  relating to taxable periods or portions
thereof that begin on or  after the Closing Date (including any Taxes
allocated to such  period under (S)9(a)(iv) hereof). The Buyer shall, if the
Parent  so requests and at the Parent\'s expense, cause the relevant  entity
to file for and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain  and expedite the
receipt of any refund to which the Parent is  entitled under this (S)9(b);
provided, however, that the Buyer  must consent to any such refund claim,
which consent may not be  unreasonably withheld; and provided further that
neither Parent  nor any affiliate of the Parent shall, without the prior
written  consent of the Buyer, which consent may not be unreasonably 
withheld, file or cause to be filed any amended Tax Return or  claim for Tax
refund solely with respect to the Company or any of  its Subsidiaries for any
period ending on or before the Closing  Date, to the extent that any such
filing may have a material  adverse effect on the Tax liability of the Buyer,
the Company or  its Subsidiaries.   (ii) The Buyer shall, and the Buyer
shall cause the  Company to, make any and all elections under (S)172(b)(3) of
the  Code and under any comparable provision of any state, local and 
foreign Tax law in any state, locality, or foreign jurisdiction  within which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries file a  combined, unitary or similar
return with the Parent or any of its  Affiliates (other than a return
including only the Company and  its Subsidiaries) to relinquish the entire
carryback period with  respect to any net operating loss attributable to the
Company or  any of its Subsidiaries in any taxable period beginning after
the  Closing Date that could be carried back to a taxable year of the 
Company or any such subsidiary ending on or before the Closing  Date. Neither
the Parent nor any Affiliate thereof shall be  required to pay to the Buyer,
the Company or any subsidiary any  refund or credit of Taxes that results
from the carryback to any  taxable period ending on or before the Closing
Date of any net  operating loss, capital loss or Tax credit attributable to
the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any taxable period  beginning
after the Closing Date, except that (i) the Company or  any of its
Subsidiaries that have not filed combined, unitary or  similar returns with
the Parent or any of its Affiliates (other  than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) shall be entitled to  carry back losses or Tax credits from any
taxable period  beginning on or after the Closing Date to any taxable period
of  such Company ending on or prior to the Closing Date, but only if  such
carryback would not impose a material Tax cost or otherwise  materially
adversely affect the Parent or any of its Affiliates  and (ii) if,
notwithstanding any election pursuant to  this (S)9(b)(ii), any credit,
deduction or loss of the Buyer, the  Company or any Subsidiary arising in any
period ending after the  Closing Date is required to be carried back and
included in any  Tax Return of the Parent, or any affiliate of the Parent 
(including the Company or any Subsidiary), for any period ending  on or
before the Closing Date, then the Parent shall pay to the  Buyer an amount
equal to the actual Tax savings produced by such  credit, deduction or loss;
provided, however, that any credit,  deduction or loss of the Parent shall be
used before any credit,  deduction or loss of the Buyer, the Company or any
Subsidiary;  and   -57-     provided further that the Parent must
consent to any such refund  claim, which consent may not be unreasonably
withheld (for this  purpose, withholding of consent shall be reasonable if
such  refund claim could reasonably be expected to have a material Tax  cost
or otherwise materially adversely affect Parent or any of  its
affiliates).   (c) Contests.   (i) After the Closing Date, each of the
Parent and the  Buyer shall promptly notify the other party in writing upon 
receipt of written notice of the commencement of any Tax audit or 
administrative or judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim  on the
Parent, the Buyer or the Company or any Subsidiary which,  if determined
adversely to the taxpayer or after the lapse of  time, would be grounds for
indemnification by the other party  under (S)9(a). Such notice shall contain
factual information (to  the extent known to the notifying party) describing
the asserted  Tax liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies
of  any notice or other document received from any Tax Authority in  respect
of any such asserted Tax liability. If the indemnitee  under (S)9(a) fails to
give the indemnitor under (S)9(a) prompt  notice of an asserted Tax liability
as required by this (S)9(c),  then the indemnitor shall not have any
obligation to indemnify  for any loss arising out of such asserted Tax
liability, but only  to the extent that failure to give such notice results
in a  detriment to the indemnitor.   (ii) In the case of an audit or
administrative or judicial  proceeding that relates to a period ending on or
before the  Closing Date, the Parent shall have the sole right, at its 
expense, to control the conduct of such audit or proceeding;  provided,
however, that the Parent shall consult with the Buyer  to the extent any
proposed adjustment may have a material adverse  effect on the Taxes of the
Buyer or the Company for taxable  periods beginning after the Closing Date.
The Buyer shall control  the defense and settlement of any contest relating
to taxable  periods or portions thereof that begin on or after the Closing 
Date, provided, however, the Buyer shall consult with the Parent  to the
extent any proposed adjustment may have a material adverse  effect on the
Taxes of the Parent for taxable periods beginning  before the Closing
Date.   (iii) With respect to periods beginning before the Closing  Date
and ending after the Closing Date, (i) each party may  participate in an
audit or proceeding which relates to any such  period and (ii) such audit or
proceeding shall be controlled by  that party which would bear the burden of
the greater portion of  the sum of the adjustment; provided that neither
party shall  settle any such audit or proceeding without the consent of the 
other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The  principle set
forth in the preceding sentence shall govern also  for purposes of deciding
any issue that must be decided jointly  (in particular, choice of judicial
forum) in situations in which  separate issues are otherwise controlled
hereunder by the Buyer  and the Parent.   -58-     (d) Preparation of
Tax Returns.   (i) The Parent shall timely prepare and file any income  Tax
Returns relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries for any  taxable periods
that end on or prior to the Closing Date (the  "Parent Returns") and timely
pay when due all Taxes relating to  such Parent Returns. The Parent Returns
shall be prepared in a  manner consistent with the prior practice of the
Company and its  Subsidiaries (except to the extent the Parent determines
that  there is no reasonable basis therefor). The Buyer shall timely 
prepare and file all other Tax Returns for taxable periods that  end on or
prior to the Closing Date (to the extent such Tax  Returns are due after the
Closing Date) as well as all Tax  Returns for taxable periods that include,
but do not end on, the  Closing Date (the "Buyer Returns"). The Buyer shall
prepare or  cause the Company to prepare such Buyer Returns in a manner 
consistent with the prior practice of the Company and its  Subsidiaries
(except to the extent Buyer determines that there is  no reasonable basis
therefor) and the Buyer shall deliver such  Buyer Returns to the Parent at
least 14 days before such Buyer  Returns are due to be filed (taking into
account any extensions  of time to file such Tax Return that have been
properly obtained)  for the Parent\'s review and comment. The Parent shall
reimburse  the Buyer for any Taxes on the Buyer Returns owed by the Parent 
pursuant to (S)9(a)(i) and (S)9(a)(iv). The Buyer shall prepare  and file or
cause the Company to prepare and file any Tax Return  relating to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for any  taxable periods that begin on or after
the Closing Date.   (ii) The Parent shall have the right to object to any 
items set forth on the Buyer Returns within seven days of the  delivery of a
particular Tax Return. In the event of such an  objection, the parties shall
attempt in good faith to resolve the  dispute. If the parties cannot resolve
any such dispute, the  items remaining in dispute shall be submitted to 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or such other independent accounting  firm of
national or regional reputation selected by, and mutually  acceptable to, the
Parent and the Buyer. The independent  accounting firm so selected shall
determine the proper amounts  for the items remaining in dispute and the
Buyer and the Parent  shall be bound by the determination by the independent
accounting  firm absent manifest error. The independent accounting firm
shall  make any such determination within seven days after submission of 
the remaining disputed items. If a Tax Return is due before the  date a
disputed item is resolved hereunder, it shall be filed as  prepared and
resolved items shall be reflected on an amended Tax  Return.   (e)
Cooperation and Exchange of Information. The Parent and the Buyer shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them
reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax
Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a
refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any audit or
other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Any information obtained under this
(S)9(e) shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in
conducting an audit or other proceeding.   -59-     (f) Tax Sharing
Arrangements. Any and all existing Tax sharing, allocation, compensation or
like agreements or arrangements, whether or not written, that include the
Company or any Subsidiary, including without limitation any arrangement by
which the Company or any Subsidiary makes compensating payments to each other
or any other member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or
other similar Tax group for the use of certain Tax attributes, shall be
terminated as of the day before the Closing Date (pursuant to a writing
executed on or before the Closing Date by all parties concerned) and shall
have no further force or effect. All liabilities of the Company or any
Subsidiary or affiliate of the Parent (for Taxes or otherwise pursuant to
such agreements or arrangements) shall be canceled on or prior to the Closing
Date.   (g) Indemnity Payments to be Treated as Purchase Price Adjustment.
The Parent, the Seller and the Buyer agree that any payments pursuant to
(S)9(a)(i) and (S)9(a)(ii) hereof shall be treated as adjustments to the
Purchase Price.   (h) Certain Taxes. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (including any New
York State Gains Tax, New York City Transfer Tax and any similar tax imposed
in other states or subdivisions), shall be paid one-half by the Parent and
Seller and one-half by the Buyer, and the Parent and Seller will file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and
fees, and, if required by applicable law, Buyer will, and will cause its
affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation. Buyer will reimburse the Parent and the Seller for one-half of
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with filing any
such Tax Returns and any such other documentation.   10. Termination.  
(a) Termination of Agreement. The Parties may terminate this Agreement as
provided below:   (i) the Buyer and the Parent and Seller may terminate 
this Agreement by mutual written consent at any time prior to the 
Closing;   (ii) the Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving  written
notice to the Parent and the Seller at any time prior to  the Closing (A) in
the event any of the Parent, the Seller or the  Company has breached any
representation, warranty, or covenant  contained in this Agreement in any
material respect, the Buyer  has notified the Parent and the Seller of the
breach, and the  breach has continued without cure for a period of thirty
(30)  days after the notice of breach or (B) if the Closing shall not  have
occurred on or before July 31, 2003, by reason of the  failure of any
condition precedent under (S)7(a) hereof (unless  the failure results
primarily from the Buyer itself breaching any  representation, warranty, or
covenant contained in this  Agreement); and   (iii) the Parent and the
Seller may terminate this  Agreement by giving written notice to the Buyer at
any time prior  to the Closing (A) in the event the   -60-     Buyer
has breached any representation, warranty, or covenant  contained in this
Agreement in any material respect, the Parent  and the Seller have notified
the Buyer of the breach, and the  breach has continued without cure for a
period of thirty (30)  days after the notice of breach or (B) if the Closing
shall not  have occurred on or before July 31, 2003, by reason of the 
failure of any condition precedent under (S)7(b) hereof (unless  the failure
results primarily from the Parent, the Seller or the  Company themselves
breaching any representation, warranty, or  covenant contained in this
Agreement).   (b) Effect of Termination. If any Party terminates
this Agreement pursuant to (S)10(a) above, all rights and obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate without any liability of any Party to any
other Party (except for any liability of any Party then in breach) except for
(S)(S)11(a), 11(h), 11(i), 11(l) and 11(p).   11. Miscellaneous.   (a)
Nature of Certain Obligations. The representations, warranties, and covenants
of the Parent and Seller in this Agreement are joint and several obligations.
This means that each of the Parent and Seller will be responsible to the
extent provided in (S)8 above for any Adverse Consequences any Buyer
Indemnified Party may suffer as a result of any breach thereof.
The representations, warranties and covenants of Holdings and the Buyer in
this Agreement are joint and several obligations. This means that each of
Holdings and the Buyer will be responsible to the extent provided in (S)8
above for any Adverse Consequences any Seller Indemnified Party may suffer as
a result of any breach thereof.   (b) Press Releases and Public
Announcements. No Party shall issue any press release or make any public
announcement relating to the subject matter of this Agreement prior to the
Closing without the prior written approval of the Buyer and the Parent and
the Seller; provided, however, that any Party may make any public disclosure
it believes in good faith is required by applicable law or any listing or
trading agreement concerning its publicly-traded securities (in which case
the disclosing Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to advise
the other Parties prior to making the disclosure).   (c) No Third-Party
Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon
any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.   (d) Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the
documents referred to herein) constitutes the entire agreement among the
Parties and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements, or
