ARTICLE 2

 



 

THE MERGER

 



 

Section 2.01. _The Merger._

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the " **Merger**
") with and into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be
the surviving corporation (the " **Surviving Corporation** ").

 



 

(b) Subject to the provisions of _Article 9_, the closing of the Merger (the
" **Closing** ") shall take place in Atlanta, Georgia at the offices of King and
Spalding LLP, 1180 Peachtree Street NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, as soon as
possible after, but in any event no later than two Business Days after, the
date the conditions set forth in _Article 9_ (other than conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, to the extent permissible, waiver of those conditions at the
Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent

 



      
 

 



 

permissible, waived by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit of such
conditions, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date
as Parent and the Company may mutually agree in writing. Notwithstanding the
immediately preceding sentence, if the Marketing Period has not ended at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article 9_
(other than those conditions that by their nature cannot be satisfied until
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permissible,
waiver of those conditions at the Closing), then the Closing shall occur
instead on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions
that is the earliest to occur of (a) any Business Day before or during the
Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than three Business
Days prior notice to the Company and (b) the second Business Day after the
final day of the Marketing Period, or on such other date as is mutually agreed
in writing by Parent and the Company. The date upon which the Closing occurs
is referred to herein as the " **Closing Date** ".

 



 

(c) At the Closing, the Company and Merger Subsidiary shall file a certificate
of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or
recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time (the " **Effective Time** ") as the
certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or
at such later time as may be specified in the certificate of merger).

 



 

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and
Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under Delaware Law.

 



 

Section 2.02. _Conversion of Shares._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Company or the holders of any shares of Company Stock or any shares of capital
stock of Parent or Merger Subsidiary:

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.02(b)_ or _Section 2.04_,
each share of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive $20.05 in cash, without
interest (such per share amount, the " **Merger Consideration** "). As of the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in accordance with _Section 2.03_, without interest.

 



 

(b) Each share of Company Stock held by the Company or owned by Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment
shall be made with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) Each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and
privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.03. _Surrender and Payment._

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " **Exchange Agent** ") for the purpose of
exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares
of Company Stock (the " **Certificates** ") or (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Stock (the " **Uncertificated Shares** "). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated
Shares. Such funds may be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by
Parent; _provided_ that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect
the Merger Consideration payable hereunder, and, following any losses, Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit
of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii)
such investments shall only be in short-term obligations of the United States
of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be
payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. Promptly
after the Effective Time (but not later than three Business Days thereafter),
Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder
of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and
instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent)
for use in such exchange.

 



 

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, upon
(i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, in the case of Certificated Shares and/or
(ii) receipt of an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other
evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in
the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger
Consideration in respect of each share of Company Stock represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share; _provided_ that until so surrendered or
transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share
shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to
receive such Merger Consideration.

 



 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

(d) The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article 2_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Stock (other than in respect of any
dividends that have been declared and remained unpaid as of

 



      
 

 



 

the Closing). After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration
of transfers of shares of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures
set forth, in this _Article 2_.

 



 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to _Section 2.03(a)_ (and any interest or other income earned
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Stock six
months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and
any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Stock for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.03_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Stock
for any amounts paid to a Governmental Authority pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 



 

Section 2.04. _Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding _Section 2.02_, shares of
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing with respect to such shares and who has demanded appraisal for such
shares in accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal
with respect to such shares. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails
to perfect or effectively withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal
with respect to such shares, such shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares of
Company Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent or as required by Applicable Law, the Company
shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any
such demands.

Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Company Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option by (ii) the number of shares of Company

of Company Restricted Shares an amount in cash equal to (i) the product of the
Merger Consideration and the number of shares of Company Stock subject to such
award of Company Restricted Shares plus (ii) all dividends, if any, accrued

to the number of shares of Company Stock underlying such Company Restricted
Stock Unit Award regardless of any prior election the holder of any such
Company Restricted Stock Unit Award may have made with respect to the payment
of such accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents.

 



 

(d) At the Effective Time, each award of performance stock (as defined in the
Omnibus Plan) that is then outstanding under the Omnibus Plan (each, an award
of " **Company Performance Shares** "), whether or not vested, and whether or
not performance criteria have been achieved, shall be canceled, automatically
and without any action on behalf of the holder or beneficiaries thereof, and
the Company shall pay an amount in cash equal to (i) the product of the Merger
Consideration and the number of shares of Company Stock that would have been
earned at the target level under the terms of the award agreement for such

of the award agreement for such Company Performance Stock Unit Award
regardless of any prior election the holder of any such Company

 



       
 

 



 

Performance Stock Unit Award may have made with respect to the payment of such
accrued but unpaid dividend equivalents.

 



 

(f) Pursuant to the terms of the Companys Amended and Restated Supplemental
Deferred Savings Plan (the " **Supplemental Plan** "), the Supplemental Plan
shall not be terminated or amended to reduce, suspend or eliminate any

account as an amount of cash equal to the product of the Merger Consideration
and the number of such shares, or deemed shares, of Company Stock, and such
amount shall be deemed to have been invested in the "Cash Fund" (as defined in
the Supplemental Plan) as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(g) Pursuant to the terms of the Companys Amended and Restated Nonemployee

bookkeeping account established under the Director Plan.

 



 

(h) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions that are
necessary and appropriate, including, without limitation, obtaining any
consents, making any amendments to the terms of any outstanding awards under
the Omnibus Plan, or terminating one or more Company Employee Plans, in order
to terminate the Omnibus Plan effective as of the Effective Time and to give
effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.05_ automatically
as of the Effective Time without any further action. All payments under this
_Section 2.05_ shall be made at or as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, but in all events within ten days following the Closing Date, pursuant

with a record date during such period or any similar event, but excluding any
change that results from any exercise of options to purchase shares of Company
Stock granted under the Companys stock option or compensation plans or
arrangements, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

 



 

Section 2.07. _Withholding Rights._ Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such

Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the

Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of
Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this

Section 4.21. _Insurance_.

 



 

(a) _Section 4.21(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule lists each insurance
policy (including fire, theft, casualty, general liability, director and
officer, workers compensation, business interruption, environmental, product
liability and automobile insurance policies and bond and surety arrangements)
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, a named insured,
or otherwise the beneficiary of coverage at any time since January 1, 2014
(each, an " _Insurance Policy_ "), and sets forth for each Insurance Policy
the policy type, insurer, policy number, effective and expiration dates,
coverage limits and deductibles.

 



 

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) all Insurance Policies
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries are in full force and effect
and all premiums due and payable thereon have been paid, and (ii) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in breach or default of any of the
Insurance Policies, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
taken any action, or failed to take any action, which, with notice or the
lapse of time, would constitute such a breach or default or permit termination
or modification of any of the Insurance Policies. During the twelve (12)
months preceding the date hereof, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of termination or cancellation
(other than non-renewal notices in the ordinary course of business) or, as of
the date hereof, denial of coverage with respect to any Insurance Policy
currently maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any material
claim made pursuant to any such Insurance Policy.

 



 

(c) Without limiting the foregoing, as of the date hereof, (i) to the
knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any notice from the applicable insurance carriers that the Insurance
Policies will not cover substantially all of the costs to repair, rebuild or
replace the Companys Facilities located in Marietta, Georgia damaged by the
Marietta Fire (the " _Marietta Facility_ ") (without deduction for
depreciation, but subject to the applicable deductible under the applicable
Insurance Policies), (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, none of the
applicable insurance carriers has reduced the amount of their respective

 



      
 

 



 

reserve for the Marietta Fire (other than any reduction resulting from the
payment of insurance proceeds to the Company in respect of the Marietta Fire),
and (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, the senior executive officers of
the Company believe in good faith, based on the terms of the applicable
Insurance Policies (which insured the Marietta Facility on a "replacement
cost" basis), that the insurance available with respect to the Marietta Fire
would reasonably be expected to cover substantially all the costs reasonably
necessary to repair, rebuild or replace the Marietta Facility (subject to the
applicable deductible under the applicable Insurance Policies).

 



 

Section 4.22. _Customers and Suppliers._

 



 

(a) _Section 4.22(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of:

 



 

(i) each customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who, on a
consolidated basis, made purchases in an aggregate amount equal to $5,000,000
or more, for the twelve (12) month period ended February 28, 2015 (the " **Top
Customers** "); and

 



 

(ii) each trade supplier of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who, on a
consolidated basis, had sales in an aggregate amount equal to $3,000,000 or
more, for the twelve (12) month period ended February 28, 2015 (the " **Top
Suppliers** ").

 



 

(b) Since January 1, 2014, there has been no termination, cancellation or, to
the Companys knowledge, threatened termination or cancellation of, or any
material modification or change in the business relationship between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of the Top Customers or Top
Suppliers. As of the date hereof, none of the Top Customers or Top Suppliers
has notified the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in writing of its
intention to materially decrease or materially limit its purchases from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date hereof, to the Companys
knowledge there exists no material dispute with any Top Customer or Top
Supplier.

 



 

Section 4.23. _Finders  Fees_. Except for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and
Smith Incorporated, there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other
intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who will be entitled to any fee or
commission from the Company or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 4.24. _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Company has received the
opinion of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, financial
advisor to the Company, to the effect that, as of the date of this Agreement,
the Merger Consideration is fair to the Companys stockholders from a
financial point of view, an accurate and complete copy of which opinion will
be made available to Parent promptly following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement for informational purposes.

 



 

Section 4.25. _Antitakeover Statute; Rights Plan_. Assuming the accuracy and
completeness of the representation and warranty in _Section 5.10_, (a) the
Company has taken all actions necessary such that the restrictions on
"business combinations" in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
do not apply to the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, (b) no other "fair price", "moratorium", "control share

 



      
 

 



 

acquisition", "business combination" or other similar antitakeover statute or
regulation enacted under state or federal laws in the United States is
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the statutes
and regulations referred to in clauses (a) and (b) collectively, " _Takeover
Statutes_ "), and (c) the Company has taken all actions necessary to render
the Rights Plan inapplicable to this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and to ensure that (i) neither Parent, Merger
Sub nor any of their Affiliates will become an "Acquiring Person" (as such
term is defined in the Rights Plan) by reason of the execution, announcement
or consummation of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, (ii) neither a "Stock Acquisition Date," a "Flip-In
Date," nor a "Flip-over Transaction or Event" (each as defined in the Rights
Plan) shall occur and no Rights shall become exercisable by reason of the
execution, announcement or consummation of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger), and (iii) the Rights Plan shall
expire at the Effective Time without payment of any consideration to any
holder of the Rights.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

 



 

Subject to _Section 11.05_, except as set forth in the Parent Disclosure
Letter, Parent represents and warrants to the Company that:

 



 

Section 5.01. _Corporate Existence and Power_. Each of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary is a corporation incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. Each of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary has all corporate power and authority required to own,
operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now
conducted, except for any failure to have such corporate power or authority
which has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of its
incorporation, Merger Subsidiary has not engaged in any activities other than
in connection with or as contemplated by this Agreement. Merger Subsidiary was
incorporated solely for the purpose of consummating the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of Merger Subsidiary have been validly issued, are fully paid
and nonassessable and are owned by, and at the Effective Time will be owned
by, Parent, free and clear of all Liens.

 



 

Section 5.02. _Corporate Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby are within the corporate power and authority of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary and, subject to the effectiveness of the Parent Written Consent,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of Parent and
Merger Subsidiary. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of
each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary. Parent, in its capacity as sole
stockholder of Merger Subsidiary, has executed a revocable stockholder consent
adopting this Agreement (the " **Parent Written Consent** "), which Parent
Written Consent by its terms becomes effective immediately following execution
of this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

Section 5.03. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the
consummation by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated
hereby require no action, consent, license, approval, or authorization of, or
filing by Parent or Merger Subsidiary with, any Governmental Authority, other
than (a) the filing of a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger with
the Delaware Secretary of State and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which Parent is qualified to do business, (b)
compliance with any applicable requirements of the HSR Act and of laws
analogous to the HSR Act existing in foreign jurisdictions, (c) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act and any other
state or federal securities laws, and (d) any actions or filings the absence
of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.04. _Non-contravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Parent and Merger Subsidiary of this Agreement and the consummation by Parent
and Merger Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
not (a) contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary, (b) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in _Section
5.03_, contravene, conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any
provision of any Applicable Law, (c) assuming compliance with the matters
referred to in _Section 5.03_, require any consent or other action by any
Person under, constitute a default under, or cause or permit the termination,
cancellation, acceleration or other change of any right or obligation or the
loss of any benefit to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled
under any provision of any Contract or other instrument binding upon Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries or (d) result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien other than Permitted Liens on any asset of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, with only such exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (b)
through (d), as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.05. _Disclosure Documents_. The information supplied by Parent for
inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, at the time the Proxy Statement and
any amendments or supplements thereto is first mailed to the stockholders of
the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholder Approval, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this _Section
5.05_ will not apply to statements or omissions included or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement based upon information supplied by the
Company or any of its representatives or advisors specifically for use or
incorporation by reference therein.

 



 

Section 5.06. _Finders  Fees_. Except for Jefferies LLC and KeyBanc Capital
Markets, whose fees will be paid by Parent, there is no investment banker,
broker, finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of Parent who will be entitled to any fee or
commission from the Parent upon consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.07. _Financing._

 



 

(a) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.05_, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters
will be sufficient to enable Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the
Merger upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement, including to pay the
Merger Consideration for all of the shares of Company Stock on a fully-diluted
basis, to make all payments in respect of the Company Stock Options, Company
Restricted Shares, Company Performance Shares, Company Restricted Stock Unit
Awards, Company Performance Stock Unit Awards, Company Share Units and
Deferred Stock Units, to pay all related fees and expenses of Parent, Merger
Subsidiary and their respective Representatives, and to make all other
payments required by this Agreement and the Financing.

 



 

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of (i) the
executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof, from Investor
(the " **Equity Commitment Letter** "), pursuant to which Investor has
committed to invest the amount set forth therein (the " **Equity Financing**
"), and (ii) fully executed commitment letter (the " **Debt Commitment
Letter** ") from Jefferies Finance LLC, KeyBank National Association and
KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. (the " **Lenders** ") confirming their respective
commitments to provide Parent with debt financing in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " **Debt Financing** ").

 



 

(c) Except for fee letters with respect to fees and related arrangements with
respect to the Debt Financing, of which Parent has delivered true, correct and
complete copies to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement (in a
redacted form removing only the fee information, but which fee information
does not relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or contain any conditions
precedent to, the funding of the Financing), there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the funding of the full
amount of the Debt Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and delivered to the Company prior to the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) Each of the Commitment Letters is in full force and effect and is a valid
and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, the other
parties thereto. None of the Commitment Letters have been amended or modified
in any respect, and the respective commitments contained therein have not been
withdrawn, rescinded or otherwise modified in any respect. No event has
occurred which would constitute a breach or default (or an event which with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default), or the failure of
any condition, on the part of Parent or its Affiliates under the Commitment
Letters or, to the knowledge of Parent on the part of the Lenders or the
Investor. There are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount
of the Financing other than the conditions precedent set forth in the
Commitment Letters, and Parent has no reason to believe that it may not be
able to satisfy any term or condition of closing of the Financing that is
required to be satisfied as a condition of the Financing, or that the
Financing may not be made available to Parent on the Closing Date. Parent (or
an Affiliate thereof) has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Commitment Letters to be paid.

 



 

(e) Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary is aware of any direct or indirect
limitation or other restriction on the ability of the Lenders in the Debt
Financing to provide financing for other potential purchasers of the Company.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the consummation of the Financing shall not be a
condition to the obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 5.08. _Solvency_. Assuming (a) the satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents obligations to consummate the Merger and (b) the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article 4_ of this Agreement
and, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Debt Financing, any alternative financing, the payment of the
aggregate Merger Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letter, and the payment
of all related fees and expenses, the Surviving Corporation on a consolidated
basis will be Solvent as of the Effective Time and immediately after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this
Agreement, " **Solvent** " when used with respect to any Person, means that,
as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the "fair saleable value"
of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (A) the value of
all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other liabilities,"
as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance
with applicable federal laws governing determinations of the insolvency of
debtors, and (B) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured, (ii) such Person will
not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital for the
operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged
following such date and (iii) such Person will be able to pay its liabilities,
including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

 



 

Section 5.09. _Litigation_. Except as would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (a)
there is no Action pending against, or, to the knowledge of the Parent
threatened in writing against, Parent or any of its Affiliates before or by
(or, in the case of threatened Actions that would be before) any Governmental
Authority and (b) neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary is subject to any
Order.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Ownership of Shares_. Neither Parent nor Merger Subsidiary, nor
any of their "affiliates" or "associates" is or has been at any time in the
three years prior to the date of this Agreement an "interested stockholder" of
the Company (as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law).

 



 

Section 5.11. _Absence of Certain Agreements_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has entered into any Contract, or authorized, committed or agreed
to enter into any Contract, pursuant to which: any stockholder of the Company
would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature
than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any stockholder of the
Company (i) agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the Merger or (ii)
agrees to vote against any Superior Proposal.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Management Agreements_. Other than this Agreement, as of the
date hereof, there are no Contracts between Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any
of their Affiliates or Representatives, on the one hand, and any member of the
Companys management or the board of directors, on the other hand, relating in
any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the operations
of the Company after the Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 5.13. _Limited Guaranty_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the Company the guaranty of Investor, dated
as of the date of this Agreement, in favor of the Company with respect to
certain obligations of Parent and Merger Subsidiary under this Agreement (the
" **Limited Guaranty** "). The Limited Guaranty is in full force and effect
and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Investor, enforceable (except
for the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception) against Investor in accordance with
its terms. There is no default under the Limited Guaranty by Investor, and no
event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default thereunder by Investor.

 



 

Section 5.14. _Non-Reliance on Company Estimates, Projections, Forecasts,
Forward-Looking Statements and Business Plans_. In connection with the due
diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Subsidiary, Parent
and Merger Subsidiary have received and may continue to receive from the
Company certain estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking
information, as well as certain business plan information, regarding the
Company and its business and operations. Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby
acknowledge that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as
well as in such business plans, with which Parent and Merger Subsidiary are
familiar, that Parent and Merger Subsidiary are taking full responsibility for
making their own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as well as such
business plans, so furnished to them (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking
information or business plans), and that Parent and Merger Subsidiary will
have no claim, right or obligation under this Agreement or otherwise
(including under _Article 9_) against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
or any of their respective Representatives, or any other Person, with respect
thereto. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby acknowledge that
none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective
Representatives, nor any other Person, has made or is making any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans).

Board of Directors of the Company that the shareholders of the Company approve
the Merger and adopt this Agreement, (b) use its commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit proxies and obtain the Company Stockholder Approval and (c)
otherwise comply in all material respects with

 



      
 

 



 

the legal requirements applicable to the Company Stockholder Meeting. The
Company shall have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting (i) for the absence of a
quorum, (ii) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of
any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith after consultation with outside counsel
is reasonably necessary under Applicable Law or fiduciary duty and for such
supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the
Companys stockholders prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, (iii) to
allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional proxies to the extent
the Company reasonably believes necessary in order to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval or (iv) if otherwise required by Applicable Law or
fiduciary duty.

 



 

Section 6.03. _Access to Information_. From the date hereof until the
Effective Time and subject to Applicable Law and the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Company shall (a) give Parent and its Representatives, upon
reasonable notice, reasonable access during normal business hours to the
offices, properties, businesses, operations and books and records of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and (b) furnish to Parent and its
Representatives such financial and operating data and other information as
such Persons may reasonably request. The Company shall cause the agents and
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate
with Parent and Parents prospective lenders and investors, as well as
Parents and Parents prospective lenders and investors Representatives in
connection with such investigation and examination. Any investigation pursuant
to this _Section 6.03_ shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Nothing in this _Section 6.03_ shall require the Company to
provide any access, or to disclose any information if, in the opinion of the
Companys outside counsel, providing such access or disclosing such
information would (i) violate any Applicable Law (including antitrust or
privacy laws) or (ii) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege and such
privilege cannot be protected by the Company through exercise of its
reasonable efforts.

 



 

Section 6.04. _Go-Shop; No Solicitation; Other Offers._

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
during the period beginning on the date hereof and continuing until 11:59 p.m.
(New York City time) on the date that is 30 days thereafter (the " **No-Shop
Period Start Date** "), the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, financial advisors, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, "
**Representatives** ") shall have the right to directly or indirectly: (i)
solicit, initiate, facilitate and encourage Acquisition Proposals, including
by way of providing access to non-public information relating to the Company
or its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided_ that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within one
Business Day) provide to Parent any non-public information relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person given such access
which was not previously provided to or made available to Parent and (ii)
enter into and maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with respect
to potential Acquisition Proposals or otherwise cooperate with, or assist or
participate in, or facilitate, any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or
negotiations.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 6.04(c)_ and _Section 6.04(d)_, from the No-Shop
Period Start Date until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with

 



      
 

 



 

 _Article 10_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective officers and directors shall, and the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall not authorize any of its or their respective Representatives to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to knowingly
facilitate or knowingly encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) enter into, engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with
or furnish any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party in connection with or
for the purpose of facilitating or encouraging an Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
except for an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, enter into any agreement
in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement relating to
an Acquisition Proposal (any such documentation referred to in this clause
(iii), " **Acquisition Proposal Documentation** "), (iv) grant any waiver,
amendment or release under any Takeover Statutes or the Rights Plan, or (v)
grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or confidentiality
agreement; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
be permitted to waive, amend, release or fail to enforce any provision of any
confidentiality, "standstill" or similar obligation of any Person if the Board
of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law. Subject to _Section 6.04(c)_ and _Section 6.04(d)_ and
except with respect to any Person from whom the Company has received a written
Acquisition Proposal prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date that satisfies the
requirements of _Section 6.04(c)(i)_ (such Person, an " **Excluded Party** ",
_provided_ that any Person shall immediately and irrevocably cease to be an
Excluded Party if, at any time after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the
Acquisition Proposal submitted by such Person is withdrawn or terminated (it
being understood that a modification of such Acquisition Proposal shall not be
deemed to be a withdrawal or termination)), on the No-Shop Period Start Date,
the Company shall, and shall cause any of its Subsidiaries and its and their
Representatives to cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party
and its Representatives with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. Within
forty-eight hours following the No-Shop Period Start Date, to the extent not
prohibited by an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, the Company shall
provide Parent with a list of Excluded Parties, including the identity of each
Excluded Party and a copy of the Acquisition Proposal submitted by each Person
on the basis of which the Board of Directors of the Company made the
determination that such Person shall be an Excluded Party.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 6.04(b)_ to the contrary,
if at any time on or after the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company or any of its
Representatives has received an Acquisition Proposal (which did not result
from any material breach of this _Section 6.04_) that the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Proposal and (ii) other than with respect to taking such
actions with an Excluded Party (but only for so long as a Person remains an
Excluded Party), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, then the Company, directly or indirectly through
its Representatives, may (A) engage in negotiations or discussions with such
Third Party and its Representatives, (B) furnish to such Third Party or its

 



      
 

 



 

Representatives non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_
that the Company shall provide to Parent promptly (and in any event within one
Business Day) any such information that is provided to any such Person which
was not previously provided to or made available to Parent and (C) take any
nonappealable, final action that any court of competent jurisdiction orders
the Company to take.

 



 

(d) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 6.04_, neither the Board
of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) recommend,
adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any
Acquisition Proposal, (B) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent or publicly propose to withhold or withdraw (or modify or qualify in
a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary) the Company Board
Recommendation (or recommend an Acquisition Proposal or authorize the Company
to enter into Acquisition Proposal Documentation (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement)), (C) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, or (D) publicly recommend any
Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the 1934 Act in a
solicitation or recommendation statement on Schedule 14D-9 filed with respect
to any such Acquisition Proposal (any action described in this clause (i), an
" **Adverse Recommendation Change** ") or (ii) execute (or allow the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to execute) any Acquisition Proposal Documentation
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything contained in this _Section 6.04_ to the contrary, prior
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if (1) in response to an
Intervening Event, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law, or (2) the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal (which did
not result from any material breach of this _Section 6.04_) that the Board of
Directors of the Company or any committee thereof determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of
such Intervening Event or such Superior Proposal and/or (y) in the case of a
Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof may authorize, and pursuant to such authorization the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries may execute, Acquisition Proposal Documentation, which
shall include a definitive acquisition agreement, with respect to such
Superior Proposal (and in connection therewith grant any waiver, amendment or
release under any Takeover Statues or the Rights Plan) if, in the case of this
clause (y), the Company concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.01(d)(i)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of Directors
of the Company or any committee thereof shall not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in respect of an Intervening Event or a Superior
Proposal, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall execute
any Acquisition Proposal Documentation and the Company shall not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)_ with respect to such Superior
Proposal unless (w) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall,
in the event of a Superior Proposal, to the extent permitted by the terms of
any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, specify the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal and attach the most current version of the
proposed agreement under which such Superior Proposal is proposed to be
consummated, and in the event of an Intervening Event, provide a reasonably
detailed

 



       
 

 



 

description of such Intervening Event); _provided_ , that it is agreed that
such notice of intent in and of itself shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change or a violation of any provisions of this _Section
6.04_, (x) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such four Business Day period (the
" **Negotiation Period** "), to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to
enable Parent to propose in writing revisions to the terms of this Agreement,
which revisions shall be evidenced by an offer to amend this Agreement that
would, upon the Companys acceptance, be binding on the Company, Parent and
Merger Subsidiary, and, if applicable, the Commitment Letters and the Limited
Guaranty, such that such Superior Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal or the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change with
respect to such Intervening Event would no longer be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (y) following the end of the
Negotiation Period, the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee
thereof shall have considered in good faith such binding offer, if any, and
shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute
a Superior Proposal or the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
with respect to such Intervening Event would continue to be reasonably likely
to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, if the
revisions proposed in such binding offer, if any, were to be given effect and
(z) in the event of any material change to the material terms of such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described in clause (w) above and the
Negotiation Period shall have recommenced, except that the Negotiation Period
shall be at least three Business Days (rather than the four Business Days
otherwise contemplated by clause (w) above); and _provided_ , _further_ ,
however, that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
sentence shall be void and of no force or effect, unless the Company pays
Parent the Go-Shop Termination Fee or Termination Fee, as applicable, in
accordance with _Section 11.04_. In addition, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company
from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the 1934 Act (or any similar
communication to its stockholders in connection with the making or amendment
of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any disclosure to its
stockholders with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
an Acquisition Proposal, which in each case, the Board of Directors of the
Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to violate U.S.
federal or state securities laws or other Applicable Law or would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the Companys Board of Directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law ( _provided_ that neither the Company
nor its Board of Directors may recommend any Acquisition Proposal unless
permitted by this _Section 6.04_), (ii) issuing a "stop, look and listen"
disclosure or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the 1934 Act ( _provided_ that the Company shall not effect or disclose
pursuant to such rules or otherwise a position which constitutes an Adverse
Recommendation Change unless permitted by this _Section 6.04_) or (iii)
contacting and engaging in discussions with any Person or group and their
respective Representatives who has made an Acquisition Proposal solely for the
purpose of clarifying such Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof.

 



 

(e) After the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall promptly (and in
any event, within 48 hours) notify Parent after receipt by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (or any of its or their Representatives) of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets,

 



      
 

 



 

books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party
that the Company knows is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal, which notice shall include the material terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request (including, if applicable,
copies of any written proposals or offers, including any proposed Acquisition
Proposal Documentation, which in each case may be redacted to the extent
necessary to comply with the terms of any Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) and, to the extent disclosure is permitted by an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, the identity of the Third Party or group of Third
Parties making such Acquisition Proposal, and the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of any material developments
with respect to or material changes to such Acquisition Proposals and shall
provide copies of any revised written proposals or offers, including any
revisions to any proposed Acquisition Proposal Documentation (which in each
case may be redacted if necessary to comply with the terms of any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) promptly upon receipt thereof, and in any event
within 48 hours.

 



 

(f) The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality or similar agreement (or any amendment to any existing
confidentiality or other agreement) with any Person that prohibits the Company
from providing to Parent any of the information required to be provided to
Parent under this _Section 6.04_ within the time periods contemplated hereby.
For the avoidance of doubt, all information provided to Parent pursuant to
this _Section 6.04_ will be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

(g) Until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _Article 10_, (i) the approval and other actions
of the Company and its Board of Directors for purposes of causing any Takeover
Statutes and the Rights Plan to be inapplicable to Parent, Merger Subsidiary
and their Affiliates, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be irrevocable and unconditional and no Adverse
Recommendation Change or any other action shall change such approval or
action, and (ii) except as otherwise permitted by this Section 6.04, the
Rights Plan shall not be amended or qualified.

 



 

Section 6.05. _FIRPTA Certificate_. On the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide to Parent a certificate, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect
that the Company Securities are not a U.S. real property interest within the
meaning of the Code Section 1445, in the form and manner set forth in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c) and reasonably acceptable to Parent, duly
executed by a responsible officer of the Company, which certification shall be
timely filed with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.

 



 

Section 6.06. _No Other Representations and Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article 5_, the Company
acknowledges and agrees that no other representation or warranty of any kind
whatsoever, express or implied, at law or in equity, is made or shall be
deemed to have been made by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Subsidiary with
respect to their respective businesses, affairs, assets, liabilities,
financial conditions, results of operations or prospects or with respect to
the accuracy or completeness of any other information provided or made
available to the Company by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Subsidiary, and
each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary hereby disclaims any such representation
or warranty, whether by or on behalf of the Parent or Merger Subsidiary, and
notwithstanding the delivery or

 



      
 

 



 

disclosure to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their Representatives or
Affiliates of any documentation or other information by the Company or any of
its Representatives or Affiliates with respect to any one or more of the
foregoing. Neither Parent, Merger Subsidiary, nor any of their respective
Representatives or Affiliates will have or be subject to any liability or
obligation to the Company or any other Person resulting from the distribution
in written or verbal communications to the Company of any information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.06_ or otherwise,
nothing herein precludes any party hereto from pursuing a claim for fraud.

Subsidiaries not to, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,

reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or
materially impair the ability of Parent and Merger Subsidiary to consummate
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
the financing thereof.

the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees, to do
the following:

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, the present and former
officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "
**Indemnified Person** ") in respect of acts or omissions in their capacity as
an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective predecessors or as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary
or agent of another enterprise if the Indemnified Person was serving in such
capacity at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective predecessors, in any case occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware Law or any other
Applicable Law or provided under the certificate of incorporation, bylaws, any
indemnification agreements and any other governing documents of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in effect on the date hereof. In the event of any
threatened or pending claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative and whether formal or
informal (each, a " **Proceeding** ") to which an Indemnified Person is, has
been or becomes a party or with respect to which an Indemnified Person is, has
been or becomes otherwise involved (including as a witness), arising in whole
or in part out of, or pertaining in whole or in part to, the fact that the
Indemnified Person is or was an officer or

 



      
 

 



 

director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors or is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors as an officer, director,

occurred, at or prior to the Effective Time, or arising out of or pertaining
to this Agreement and the transactions and actions contemplated hereby), (i)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation
shall, advance fees, costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
disbursements) incurred by each Indemnified Person in connection with and
prior to the final disposition of such Proceedings, such fees, costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) to be advanced within
twenty Business Days of receipt by Parent from the Indemnified Person of a
request therefor, provided that such Indemnified Person delivers an
undertaking to the Surviving Corporation, agreeing to repay such advanced
fees, costs and expenses if it is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final nonappealable order that such Indemnified Person was
not entitled to indemnification with respect to such fees, costs and expenses,
and (ii) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise
or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Proceeding in which
indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Person hereunder, unless
such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of
such Indemnified Person from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or
such Indemnified Person otherwise consents in writing. If any claim for
indemnification is asserted or made by any Indemnified Person pursuant to this
_Section 7.04_, any determination required to be made with respect to whether
such Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards under Delaware
Law, the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation, other
Applicable Law or any applicable indemnification agreement shall be made by
independent legal counsel selected by such Indemnified Person that is
reasonably acceptable to the Surviving Corporation. If any Proceeding is
brought against any Indemnified Person in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Person under this _Section 7.04_, (A) the
Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the defense thereof
after the Effective Time, (B) each Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
retain his or her own counsel in connection with such Proceeding, and (C) no
Indemnified Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or
her prior express written consent. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement, compromise or consent to the
entry of judgment or termination unless such settlement, compromise or consent
is approved in writing in advance by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be maintained in
effect all provisions in the Surviving Corporations certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or in such documents of any successor to the
business of the Surviving Corporation) and in the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and other governing documents of the Companys
Subsidiaries regarding (i) elimination of liability of directors, (ii)
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and (iii) advancement of
expenses, in each case, that are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions in existence on the date of
this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain and fully pay the
premium for the non-cancellable extension of the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policies and the Companys existing

 



      
 

 



 

fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, " **D andO Insurance**"),
in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period ending six years from
and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period
of time at or prior to the Effective Time, from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies with respect to any
actual or alleged error, misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission,
neglect, breach of duty or any matter claimed against a director or officer of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of him or her serving in such
capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ that the maximum aggregate annual premium for such
policies for any such year shall not be in excess of 300% of the amount per
annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year (which amount the Company
represents and warrants is set forth in _Section 7.04(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter); _provided_ , _further_ , that if the premiums of such
"tail" policy exceed such amount, the Company may obtain such a "tail" policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount. If the Company
does not obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six years from
and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof
with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided under the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the Surviving
Corporation shall purchase from the Companys current insurance carrier or
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance comparable
DandO Insurance for such six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons than
as provided in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof;
_provided_ that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum the Company paid in
its last full fiscal year (which amount the Company represents and warrants is
set forth in _Section 7.04(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); and
_provided, further,_ that if the premiums of such insurance coverage exceed
such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior
to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if an Indemnified Person
is or has been a party to or is or has been otherwise involved (including as a
witness) in any Proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective
Time) on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the
provisions of this _Section 7.04_ shall continue in effect with respect to
such Indemnified Person until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

 



 

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.04_.

 



 

(f) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this _Section 7.04_ shall be
in addition to any rights such Person may have under the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other governing documents of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, under Delaware Law or any other Applicable Law or under any
agreement of any Indemnified Person with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(g) The provisions of this _Section 7.04_ shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each Indemnified Person referred to in this _Section 7.04_ and his or her
heirs and representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 7.05. _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent shall honor, pay, perform and satisfy
any and all liabilities, obligations and responsibilities to, or in respect
of, each employee who is employed immediately prior to the Closing and who
remains in the employ of Parent, the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries after
the Closing (each such individual, a " **Continuing Employee** ") arising
under the terms of any Company Employee Plan that is an employment,
consulting, retention, severance, change-of-control or similar agreement, in
accordance with the terms thereof in effect on the Closing; _provided_ ,
however, that nothing herein shall be construed as prohibiting the amendment
or termination of any of the foregoing in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, (i) Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that no waiting periods, exclusions or limitations with
respect to any pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good
health or actively-at-work exclusions are applicable to any Continuing
Employees or their dependents or beneficiaries under any welfare benefit plans
in which such employees may be eligible to participate and (ii) Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided that any costs or expenses incurred by
Continuing Employees (and their dependents or beneficiaries) up to (and
including) the Closing shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, co-payment, coinsurance, maximum out-of-pocket
provisions and like adjustments or limitations on coverage under any such
welfare benefit plans. With respect to each employee benefit plan, policy or
practice, including, without limitation, severance, vacation and paid time off
plans, policies or practices, sponsored or maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates (the " **Parent Plans** "), Parent shall grant, or cause to be

(d) As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the Company will

(e) Nothing in this _Section 7.05_, express or implied, is intended to or
shall confer upon any other Person, including any Continuing Employee, any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this

such offer is accepted, commit to and take (and cause its Affiliates to take))
with respect to itself and its Affiliates and the Company and its Subsidiaries
any and all actions necessary, proper or advisable to avoid and eliminate each
and every impediment under any antitrust, competition, trade regulation or

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby), in each case, as may
be necessary, proper or advisable in order to (A) obtain clearance under the
HSR Act, (B) obtain any other Approval from any Governmental Authority, (C)
avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or to vacate or lift, any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or

delaying the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated hereby, or (D) avoid the commencement of any action or proceeding
that seeks to prohibit the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement. In addition, Parent shall vigorously defend (including through
litigation on the merits) against any claim asserted by any Governmental

or terminated, any decree, order or judgment (whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent) that could restrain, prevent or delay the consummation of the
Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other

acquisition by it or its Affiliates of any interest in any Person that derives
revenues from products, services or lines of business similar to the products,
services or lines of business of the Company and its Subsidiaries) if such
action would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not
obtaining the consents, approvals or clearance under any antitrust,
competition, trade regulation or other Applicable Law necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Each Party shall (i) promptly notify the other Parties of any written
communication to that Party from the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any State

Partys reasonable comments, (ii) not participate in or agree to participate
in any substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in
respect of any filing, investigation or inquiry concerning any antitrust,
competition or trade regulation matters in connection with this Agreement or
the Merger unless it consults with the other Parties in advance and, to the
extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat and (iii) furnish the other
Parties with copies of all correspondence, filings, and communications (and
memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between them and their
Affiliates and their respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any

in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, except that any materials
concerning the Companys valuation of the transaction, the Companys internal
financial information or competitively sensitive information of the Company
and its Subsidiaries may be redacted or limited to outside counsel pursuant to
any applicable joint defense or common interest agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing, Parent agrees that, at any time in an investigation, if a
Governmental Authority suggests or proffers a settlement of the investigation
to permit the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to be consummated, Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one (1)
calendar day) communicate the terms of the offer to the Company.

 



 

Section 8.02. _Certain Filings._

 



 

(a) The Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof (and in any event use commercially
reasonable efforts to file within 20 Business Days after the date hereof), a
proxy statement in preliminary form relating to the Company Stockholder
Meeting (such proxy statement, including any amendment or supplement thereto,
the " **Proxy Statement** "). The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one
another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement, (ii) in
determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any material contracts, in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) in taking such actions or making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith or with the Proxy
Statement and seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals
or waivers.

and comment on the Proxy Statement each time before it is filed with the SEC,
and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any
comments made by Parent and its counsel. The Company shall provide Parent and

oral, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement promptly after receipt of
those comments or other communications and (ii) a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the Companys response to those comments and to provide
comments on that response (to which reasonable and good faith consideration
shall be given).

 



       
 

 



 

Section 8.03. _Parent Financing._

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and
conditions described in or contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter as soon
as practicable following the date of this Agreement on the terms and
conditions, taken as a whole (including the "market flex" provisions)
described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including using its reasonable best
efforts to (i) comply with its obligations under the Debt Commitment Letter,
(ii) negotiate and enter into the Debt Financing Documents and other
definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter, for which
the amount of commitments shall be no less and the conditions to funding shall
be no more restrictive than as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, (iii)
satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Merger
Subsidiary contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including definitive
agreements related thereto), including the payment of any commitment,
engagement or placement fees required as a condition to the Debt Financing,
and (iv) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing, subject to
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained in this Agreement.
Parent shall not agree to any amendment or modification to be made to, or any
waiver of any provision or remedy, under the Debt Commitment Letter without
the prior written consent of the Company if such amendments, modifications or
waivers could reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing below the amount required to consummate the Merger, repay or
refinance the debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Debt Commitment
Letter and pay all related fees and expenses, (B) impose new or additional
conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing, (C) prevent, impede or
materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (D) adversely impact the ability of Parent or Merger Subsidiary
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt Commitment Letter;
provided, that this sentence shall not prohibit any amendment to the Debt
Commitment Letter solely to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners,
syndication agents or similar entities which had not executed the Debt
Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. Upon any amendment, supplement or
modification of the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with this _Section
8.03_, Parent shall provide a copy thereof to the Company and the term "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall mean the Debt Commitment Letter as so amended,
supplemented or modified.

 



 

(b) If funds in the amounts set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, or any
portion thereof, become unavailable to Parent on the terms and conditions set
forth therein, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such event to (i) notify the Company
in writing thereof, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain substitute
financing (on terms and conditions that are not materially less favorable to
Parent and Merger Subsidiary, taken as a whole, than the terms and conditions
as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, taking into account any "market
flex" provisions thereof) sufficient to enable Parent to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with its terms
(the " **Substitute Financing** ") and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to
obtain a new commitment letter that provides for such Substitute Financing
and, promptly after execution thereof, deliver to the Company true, complete
and correct copies of the new commitment letter and fee letter (in a redacted
form removing only the fee information, but which fee information does not
relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or contain any conditions
precedent to, the funding of the Debt Financing) and related definitive
financing documents with respect to such

 



      
 

 



 

Substitute Financing; _provided_ that Parent shall not be required to (x) seek
any Substitute Financing less favorable, in any material respect, on an
economic basis, to Parent than the terms contained in the Financing Commitment
Letters or (y) pay any fees or other compensation in any form materially
greater than those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or any related
fee letter (whether to secure waiver of any conditions contained therein or
otherwise). Upon obtaining any commitment for any such Substitute Financing,
such financing shall be deemed to be a part of the "Debt Financing" and any
commitment letter for such Substitute Financing shall be deemed the "Debt
Commitment Letter" for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no new commitment letter or new fee letter may expand upon the
conditions precedent or contingencies to the funding at the Closing of the
Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in effect on the
date hereof or which would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
ability or likelihood of Parent or Merger Subsidiary to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall give the Company prompt notice: (i) of
any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to any Debt Commitment Letter or
definitive document related to the Debt Financing, (ii) of the receipt of any
written notice or other written communication from any party to any Debt
Commitment Letter with respect to any actual or threatened breach, default,
withdrawal, termination or repudiation by any party to any Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or any
provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to
the Debt Financing, (iii) of any material written dispute or disagreement
between or among Parent and any of the other parties to the Debt Commitment
Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing that would
result or reasonably be likely to result in all or a portion of the Debt
Financing not being available to Parent at the Closing, (iv) of any amendment
or modification of, or waiver under, the Debt Commitment Letter or any related
fee letters and (v) if for any reason Parent or Merger Subsidiary believes in
good faith that it will not be able to timely obtain all or any portion of the
Debt Financing. Promptly following any written request by the Company
therefor, Parent shall (x) provide the Company any information requested by
the Company in writing relating to any circumstance referred to in clause (i),
(ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of the immediately preceding sentence, (y) keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing (or Substitute Financing
obtained in accordance with _Section 8.03(b)_) (z) and provide to the Company
copies of all documents related to the Debt Financing (or Substitute Financing
obtained in accordance with _Section 8.03(b)_), other than any ancillary
agreements subject to confidentiality agreements (except to the extent such
agreements relate to the amounts or conditionality of, or contain any
conditions precedent to, the funding of the Debt Financing (or Substitute
Financing obtained in accordance with _Section 8.03(b)_), including any
"market flex" provisions).

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts, and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives, at
Parents sole expense, to cooperate with Parents efforts to consummate the
Debt Financing, including the following: (i) participation by management with
appropriate seniority and expertise in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating
agencies in connection with the Debt Financing, (ii) assisting with the
preparation of materials for rating

 



      
 

 



 

agency presentations, offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents required in
connection with the Debt Financing, and identifying any portion of the
information set forth in marketing materials that would constitute material,
non-public information regarding the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective securities, (iii) delivery of customary authorization letters
that authorize the distribution of the confidential information memorandum in
connection with the Debt Financing to prospective lenders, (iv) furnishing
Parent and Merger Subsidiary and the Financing Sources with the Required
Financial Information in Compliant form, and other financial and other
pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Parent that are necessary for the satisfaction of the obligations and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (v) assisting Parent in the
preparation of the pro forma financial statements required in connection with
the Debt Commitment Letter, (vi) ensuring that the Financing Sources benefit
from the existing lending relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(vii) obtaining accountants comfort letters reasonably requested by Parent,
(viii) solely to the extent required by the Debt Commitment Letter, assisting
Parent and Merger Subsidiary in procuring corporate and facilities ratings in
connection with the Debt Financing, (ix) subject to customary confidentiality
arrangements, providing other customary and reasonable due diligence materials
to the Financing Sources and potential lenders necessary to consummate the
Financing, (x) facilitating the entrance into one or more credit or other
agreements reasonably satisfactory to Parent in connection with the Debt
Financing to the extent direct borrowings or debt incurrences by the Company
or its Subsidiaries are contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including
participation by senior management of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the
negotiation of such agreements, _provided_ that neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to enter into any such agreement prior to
the Effective Time, (xi) providing customary payoff letters requested by
Parent or the Financing Sources relating to the repayment of existing
indebtedness of the Company and the release of related Liens to the extent
such debt is required to be repaid hereunder, and (xii) facilitating the
entrance into other documents and instruments relating to guarantees, the
pledge of collateral and other matters ancillary to the Debt Financing as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Debt Financing and
otherwise reasonably facilitating the pledge of collateral and providing of
guarantees contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including participation
by senior management of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the negotiation of
such documents and instruments ( _provided_ that the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall not be required to enter into any such document or
instrument prior to the Effective Time); _provided_ that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (including this _Section
8.03_), (A) nothing in this Agreement (including this _Section 8.03_) shall
require any such cooperation to the extent that it would (1) require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives, as applicable, to waive
or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other
fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time, unless reimbursed
by Parent in connection therewith, or incur any liability or give any
indemnities or otherwise commit to take any action that is not contingent upon
the Effective Time, (2) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to

Subsidiaries is a party, (3) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into or approve, prior to the Effective Time, any financing or purchase

which Parent intends to operate, or cause to be operated, the business of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries after the Effective Time and (D)
Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company or promptly cause the Company to
be reimbursed for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including the reasonable attorneys fees of outside counsel)
incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the
actions and cooperation pursuant to this _Section 8.03_ _._ Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and its
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this _Section 8.03(d)_) and

and as of such time, except for immaterial inaccuracies and (iii) all other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement
shall be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of
the Effective Time as though made at and as of such time (other than any such
representation and warranty that by its terms addresses matters only as of
another specified time, which shall be true only as of such time), in each
case without regard to any qualifications as to Company Material Adverse
Effect or materiality contained in such representations and warranties, except
where the failure of any such representations or warranties in this clause
(iii) to be so true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(b) the Company shall not have breached in any material respect, or failed to
perform in all material respects, the obligations required to be performed by
it under this Agreement contemplated to be performed at or prior to the
Effective Time;

 



 

(c) since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have been any
Circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and that is
continuing; and

 



 

(d) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate signed by an
executive officer of the Company dated as of the date of the Effective Time
certifying that the conditions specified in _Section 9.02(a)_, _Section
9.02(b)_ and _Section 9.02(c)_ have been satisfied.

of the Company to consummate the Merger is further subject to the satisfaction
(or waiver, if permissible under Applicable Law) at or prior to the Effective
Time of each of the following conditions:

 



 

(a) (i) the representations and warranties of Parent contained in _Sections
5.01_ and _5.02_ of this Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects
as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the Effective Time as though

warranty that by its terms addresses matters only as of another specified
time, which shall be true and correct only as of such time), in each case
without regard to any qualifications as to Parent Material Adverse Effect or
materiality contained in such representations and warranties, except where the

true and correct, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect;

 



 

(b) Parent shall not have breached in any material respect, or failed to
perform in all material respects, the material obligations required to be

terminating this Agreement and abandoning the Merger, on the failure of any
condition set forth in _Section 9.01_, _Section 9.02_ or _Section 9.03_, as
the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such Partys
breach in any material respect of any provision of this Agreement or failure
in any material respect to use the standard of efforts required from such
Party to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

TERMINATION

 



 

Section 10.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding any
approval of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company or by Parent as
sole stockholder of Merger Subsidiary), it being understood that any
termination by Parent shall also constitute a termination by Merger
Subsidiary:

 



 

(a) by mutual written agreement of the Company and Parent;

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) the Merger has not been consummated on or before October 6, 2015 (the "
**End Date** "); _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any Party
whose breach of any provision of this Agreement was a principle cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such time;

 



 

(ii) there shall be any permanent injunction or other order issued by any
court of competent jurisdiction preventing, prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the Merger and such injunction or other order shall have
become final and nonappealable; or

 



 

(iii) at the Company Stockholder Meeting (including after taking into account
any adjournment, postponement or recess thereof), the Company Stockholder
Approval shall not have been obtained; or

 



 

(c) by Parent, if,

 



 

(i) an Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred; or

 



 

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set forth in this Agreement
shall have occurred and such breach would cause the condition set forth in
_Section 9.02(a)_ or _Section 9.02(b)_ not to be satisfied, and such
condition is incapable of being satisfied by the End Date or, if curable, such
breach is not cured by the Company prior to the earlier of (x) the twentieth
(20th) Business Day after the Companys receipt of written notice thereof from
Parent or (y) the End Date; or

 



 

(d) by the Company, if:

 



 

(i) prior to the Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company authorizes the Company to enter into Acquisition Proposal
Documentation concerning a Superior Proposal; _provided_ that (x) the Company
has complied in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
_Section 6.04_ as such provisions expressly relate to such Superior Proposal
and (y) concurrently with such termination the Company enters into the
Acquisition Proposal Documentation and complies with its obligations under
_Section 6.04(d)_ and _Section 11.04_ to pay the Go-Shop Termination Fee or
the Termination Fee, as applicable;

 



 

(ii) a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any
covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in
this Agreement shall have occurred and such breach would cause the conditions
set forth in _Section 9.03(a)_ or _Section 9.03(b)_ not to be satisfied, and
such condition is incapable of being satisfied by the End Date or, if curable,
such breach is not cured by Parent prior to the earlier of (x) the twentieth
(20th) Business Day after Parents receipt of written notice thereof from the
Company or (y) the End Date; or

 



 

(iii) (x) the Marketing Period has ended and all of the conditions set forth
in _Section 9.01_ and _Section 9.02_ have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions

 



      
 

 



 

that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but are then capable
of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur), (y) the Company provided
written notice to Parent and Merger Subsidiary that it was ready and willing
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (subject to the
satisfaction of all of the conditions set forth in _Article 9_) and (z)
Parent and Merger Subsidiary fail to consummate the Merger within two Business
Days following the later of (1) the Companys delivery of such notice and (2)
the date on which the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section
2.01(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that during such period of two Business
Days, no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(i)_.

 



 

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.01_ (other than pursuant to _Section 10.01(a)_) shall give notice of such
termination to the other Party.

 



 

Section 10.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Section 10.01_, this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect without liability of any Party (or any stockholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such Party) to the other
Parties; _provided_ that, subject to _Sections 11.04_ and _11.14_ , no such
termination shall relieve any Party of any liability for damages (which the
Parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to reimbursement of
expenses or out-of-pocket costs) incurred or suffered by the other Party
resulting from fraud or willful breach. The provisions of this _Section
10.02_ and _Sections 8.03(d)_ (last two sentences only), _11.04_ , _11.06_ ,
_11.07_ , _11.08_ , _11.09_ and _11.10_ shall survive any termination hereof
pursuant to _Section 10.01_.

other writing delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 11.03. _Amendments and Waivers._

 



 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each Party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each Party against whom the waiver is to be
effective; _provided_ that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been
obtained there shall be no amendment or waiver that would require the further
approval of the stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law without such
approval having first been obtained. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the definitions of "Financing Sources" and
"Lenders" and the provisions of _Sections 10.01_ , _11.04 (e)_ , _11.04 (f)_ ,
_11.04(g)_ , _11.06(a)_ , _11.07_ , _11.08_ , _11.09_ , _11.12_ and this
_Section 11.03(a)_ (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an
amendment, modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify
the substance of any such Section) may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated in a manner that adversely affects the Financing Sources without
the prior written consent of the Financing Sources adversely affected thereby.

 



 

(b) No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or

 



       
 

 



 

privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 11.04. _Expenses; Termination Fees._

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Party incurring such cost
or expense.

 



 

(b) (i) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)(i)_ as a result of an Adverse Recommendation Change in respect of a
Superior Proposal or by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(i)_ and
either (A) such termination occurs on or before the No-Shop Period Start Date
or (B) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with an Excluded Party
with respect to a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 10.01(d)(i)_
on or before the date that is the later of (I) the date that is 10 days after
the No-Shop Period Start Date and (II) the date that is one day after the date
on which the last Negotiation Period ends, then the Company shall pay to
Parent by wire transfer of immediately available funds $8,750,000 (the " **Go-
Shop Termination Fee** "). If (x) this Agreement is terminated by Parent
pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)(i)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(i)_ and (y) the Go-Shop Termination Fee is not payable pursuant to
the preceding sentence, or if this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to Section 10.01(b)(i) and at the time of such termination
Parent would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.01(c)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent by wire transfer
of immediately available funds $17,500,000 (the " **Termination Fee** "). The
Go-Shop Termination Fee and the Termination Fee, as applicable, shall be
payable by the Company in the case of a termination (I) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 10.01(c)(i)_ or _Section 10.01(b)(i)_ if at the time of such
termination Parent would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 10.01(c)(i)_, within one Business Day after such
termination and (II) by the Company pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(i)_,
substantially concurrently with and as a condition to such termination.

 



 

(ii) If (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 10.01(b)(iii)_ and at the time of termination all conditions to the
consummation of the Merger set forth in _Section 9.01_ and _Section 9.03_,
other than the condition set forth in _Section 9.01(a)_, have been satisfied
or waived (or are then capable of being satisfied) and (B) an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly announced after the date of this Agreement
and not withdrawn prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, then the Company
shall promptly (but in no event more than two Business Days following receipt
of an invoice therefor) reimburse Parent for all expenses and out-of-pocket
costs incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions hereby (including the Financing), by wire transfer of
same day funds to one or more accounts designated by Parent (the Parties agree
that in no event shall the aggregate amount of expense reimbursement pursuant
to this clause exceed $5,000,000); _provided_ , that if within twelve months
following the date of such termination, the Company enters into Acquisition
Proposal Documentation (which Acquisition Proposal is later consummated) or
consummates an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that for purposes of this
proviso, each reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
shall be deemed to be a

 



      
 

 



 

reference to "50%"), then the Company shall pay to Parent in immediately
available funds, the Termination Fee (less the amount of expense reimbursement
actually paid to Parent pursuant to this _Section 11.04(b)(ii)_) upon the
consummation of such Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(iii) If this Agreement is terminated (x) by the Company pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(ii)_ or _Section 10.01(d)(iii)_ or (y) by the Company or Parent
pursuant to _Section 10.01(b)(i)_, if, at the time of such termination, the
Company would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 10.01(d)(ii)_ or _Section 10.01(d)(iii)_, then, in each case,
Parent shall pay to the Company by wire transfer of immediately available
funds $33,750,000 (the " **Parent Termination Fee** ") within one Business Day
after such termination.

 



 

(c) In no event shall (i) a Termination Fee be payable if a Go-Shop
Termination Fee is payable or (ii) more than one Termination Fee, Go-Shop
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee be payable, whether or not the
Termination Fee, Go-Shop Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as
applicable, may be payable at different times or upon the occurrence of
different events.

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section 11.04_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, fails to timely pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section 11.04_, and,
in order to obtain such payment, the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
commences a Proceeding that results in a court judgment in its favor, such
paying Party shall pay to the other Party or Parties, as applicable, its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such Proceeding, together
with interest on the amount of such payment from the date such payment was
required to be made under this _Section 11.04_ until the actual date of
payment at a rate per annum equal to the prime interest rate published in _The
Wall Street Journal_ on the date such interest begins accruing.

 



 

(e) If the Go-Shop Termination Fee or the Termination Fee is payable and paid
by the Company pursuant to _Section 11.04(b)(i)_ or _Section 11.04(b)(ii)_,
Parent and Merger Subsidiary agree that (i) Parents right to receive the Go-
Shop Termination Fee or the Termination Fee, as applicable, from the Company
shall be Parents and Merger Subsidiarys sole and exclusive remedy against
the Company and its Representatives relating to or arising out of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) upon payment of the
Go-Shop Termination Fee or the Termination Fee, as applicable, neither the
Company nor any of its Representatives shall have any further liability or
obligation to Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective
Representatives relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including for (A) any loss suffered as a
result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
and (B) any consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, and (iii)
none of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, nor any other Person shall be entitled to
bring or maintain any Action against the Company or any of its Representatives
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or
any matters forming the basis for such termination. Notwithstanding the

 



      
 

 



 

foregoing, nothing in this _Section 11.04(e)_ shall limit the right of Parent
to bring or maintain any Action for injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief to the extent provided in _Section 11.14_, unless and until
this Agreement has been terminated and the Go-Shop Termination Fee or the
Termination Fee, as applicable, has been paid in accordance with this _Section
11.04_. Under no circumstances will Parent be entitled to receive both a grant
of specific performance, on the one hand, and the Go-Shop Termination Fee or
the Termination Fee, on the other hand.

 



 

(f) If the Parent Termination Fee is payable and paid to the Company pursuant
to _Section 11.04(b)(iii)_, the Company agrees that (i) the Companys right
to receive the Parent Termination Fee plus any amounts owed pursuant to
_Section 8.03(d)_ and _Section 11.04(d)_ (the " **Recoverable Amounts** ")
from Parent (or from Investor pursuant to the Limited Guaranty) shall be the
Companys sole and exclusive remedy against Parent, Investor, any Financing
Source, and their respective Representatives relating to or arising out of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) upon payment of
the Recoverable Amounts, none of Parent, Investor nor any Financing Source,
nor any of their respective Representatives, shall have any further liability
or obligation to the Company, the Companys stockholders, or any of their
respective Representatives relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including for (A) any loss suffered as a
result of any breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
and (B) any consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, and (iii)
none of the Company, the Companys stockholders, nor any other Person shall be
entitled to bring or maintain any Action against Parent, the Investor, any
Financing Source or any of their respective Representatives arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming
the basis for such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
_Section 11.04(f)_ shall limit the right of the Company (x) to bring or
maintain any Action for injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief to the extent provided in _Section 11.14_, unless and until this
Agreement has been terminated and the Parent Termination Fee has been paid in
accordance with this _Section 11.04_, or (y) to bring or maintain any Action
against Parent or any of its Affiliates arising out of or in connection with a
breach of the Confidentiality Agreement. Under no circumstances will the
Company be entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and the
Parent Termination Fee.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Financing Source shall
have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of the parties hereto or
for any claim (whether in tort, contract or otherwise), based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby or in respect of any
oral representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith. In no
event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates, and the Company agrees not
to and to cause its Affiliates not to, (a) seek to enforce this Agreement
against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to
recover monetary damages from, any Financing Source or (b) seek to enforce the
commitments against, make any claims for breach of the Debt Commitment Letter
against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or otherwise sue, the
Financing Sources for any reason, including in connection with the Debt
Commitment Letter or the obligations of lenders thereunder. Nothing in this
_Section 11.04(g)_ shall in any way limit or qualify the liabilities of the
Financing Sources and the other parties to the Debt Financing (or the
definitive documents entered into pursuant thereto) to each other thereunder
or in connection therewith.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.05. _Disclosure Letter_. The Parties agree that any reference in a
particular Section of either the Company Disclosure Letter or the Parent
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the relevant Party that are contained in the
corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations and
warranties of such Party that are contained in this Agreement to the extent
that such disclosure is set forth with such specificity that it is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is applicable to
such Sections. The mere inclusion of an item in either the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or
warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item represents a material
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable.

 



 

Section 11.06. _Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment._

 



 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and assigns, and no
provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the
Parties and their respective successors and assigns, other than: (i) with
respect to the provisions of _Section 7.04_ which shall inure to the benefit
of the persons or entities benefiting therefrom who are intended to be third-
party beneficiaries thereof, (ii) at and after the Effective Time, the rights
of the holders of shares of Company Stock to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) at
and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Shares, Company Performance Shares, Company
Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Company Performance Stock Unit Awards, Company
Share Units and Deferred Stock Units to receive the payments contemplated by
the applicable provisions of _Section 2.05_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Financing Sources shall be express third-party beneficiaries of _Sections
10.01_ , _ 11.03(a)_, _11.04(e)_ , _11.04(f)_ , _11.04(g)_ , _11.07_ ,
_11.08_ , _11.09_ , _11.12_ and this _Section 11.06(a)_. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties.

 



 

(b) No Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other Parties;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to the Closing, Parent or Merger
Subsidiary may (i) assign all (but not less than all) of its rights or
obligations hereunder to a wholly-owned (direct or indirect) subsidiary of
Parent or Merger Subsidiary or any Affiliate of Parent or Merger Subsidiary,
provided that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of its
obligations hereunder, and (ii) collaterally assign any or all of its rights,
but not its obligations, under this Agreement to any Lender. Nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or otherwise impede the transfer or other assignment
of the equity interests in Parent or Merger Subsidiary (or both) to any
Affiliate thereof.

 



 

Section 11.07. _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to the conflicts of law rules of such state.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 11.08. _Jurisdiction._

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of,
or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (whether brought by any Party or any of
its Affiliates or against any Party or any of its Affiliates) shall be brought
exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such
court shall not have jurisdiction, exclusively in any federal court located in
the State of Delaware or other Delaware state court, and each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Proceeding and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Proceeding in any
such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such
court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
Proceeding may be served on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each Party agrees that service of process on such Party as provided in
_Section 11.01_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party irrevocably agrees and consents to
be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States District Court
of the Southern District of New York or any New York State court, in each
case, sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, and any appellate court therefrom
in any suit, action or proceeding against any Financing Source arising out of,
or relating to, the transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder.

 



 

(b) EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUBSIDIARY AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
DESIGNATES THE CORPORATION SERVICE COMPANY (IN SUCH CAPACITY, THE " **PROCESS
AGENT** "), WITH AN OFFICE AT 2711 CENTERVILLE ROAD, SUITE 400, CITY OF
WILMINGTON, COUNTY OF NEW CASTLE, DELAWARE 19808 AS ITS DESIGNEE, APPOINTEE
AND AGENT TO RECEIVE, FOR AND ON ITS BEHALF SERVICE OF PROCESS IN SUCH
JURISDICTION IN ANY PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
AGREEMENT EXECUTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AND SUCH SERVICE SHALL
BE DEEMED COMPLETE UPON DELIVERY THEREOF TO THE PROCESS AGENT; _PROVIDED_ THAT
IN THE CASE OF ANY SUCH SERVICE UPON THE PROCESS AGENT, THE PARTY EFFECTING
SUCH SERVICE SHALL ALSO DELIVER A COPY THEREOF TO EACH OTHER SUCH PARTY IN THE
MANNER PROVIDED IN _SECTION 11.01_ OF THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY SHALL TAKE
ALL SUCH ACTION AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO CONTINUE SAID APPOINTMENT IN FULL FORCE
AND EFFECT OR TO APPOINT ANOTHER AGENT SO THAT SUCH PARTY WILL AT ALL TIMES

 _ _

which they are entitled at law or in equity, and the Parties further waive any

set forth in _Sections 9.01_ and _9.02_ have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at or shortly before the
Closing (provided, such conditions would be satisfied if the Closing were to
occur on any relevant date during the pendency of such action for specific
performance) and those conditions that Parents breach of this Agreement or
the Commitment Letters has caused not to be satisfied), (ii) the Debt
Financing has been funded or would concurrently be funded in accordance with
the terms thereof at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing that if
specific performance or other equitable relief is granted and the Equity
