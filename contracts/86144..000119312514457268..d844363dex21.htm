Buyer being deemed to be the owner of the Transferred Assets transferred at
the Closing from and after the Cut-Off Time and being entitled to receive all
operating income of such Transferred Assets thereafter, and being obligated to
pay all expenses related to such Transferred Assets, with respect to
the Closing Date: __

(i) _Rent and Other Income._ Rent, and other amounts due and payable by
Tenants under any Leases shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the
Cut-Off Time; provided, however, that common area maintenance charges (" _CAM
Charges_ ") shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of December 31,
2014 (" _Year-End_ "), with Seller responsible for refund of any over-
collection of CAM Charges allocable to the period prior to Year-End. If any
arrearage exists or pre-Closing CAM Charges are unpaid under any Lease as of
the Cut-Off Time, any amounts collected on or after the Closing Date with
respect to such Lease shall be applied first to amounts then due and payable
under such Lease with respect to the period from and after the Cut-Off Time,
and thereafter to any amounts then due and payable under such Lease with
respect to the period prior to the Cut-Off Time. From and after Closing, Buyer
shall use Reasonable Efforts to collect all pre-Closing arrearages and CAM
Charges for the benefit of Seller; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Buyer shall
have no obligation to file any Action against Tenants in connection therewith.
Seller shall bear the tenant improvement allowances, brokerage commissions and
similar leasing costs consistent with past practice with respect to leases
and letters of intent for leases that commence or that are projected to
commence before January 1, 2015 as provided in Exhibit B, and Buyer shall bear
all other leasing costs with respect to the leasing of the Real
Property. Seller agrees that after the Closing Date Seller will not institute
litigation to collect arrearages in Rents or pre-Closing CAM Charges under a
Lease unless such Lease has been terminated and Buyer has not already
instituted litigation to collect such arrearages or pre-Closing CAM Charges,
as applicable. Seller shall indemnity, defend and hold harmless Buyer from and
against any and all claims, demands, losses and/or liabilities (including
reasonable attorneys fees and costs) arising as a result of claims by
Tenants for refunds owing to such Tenants allocable to the period prior to the
Year-End for reconciliation of CAM Charges to the extent that Seller has not
paid Buyer or given credit to Buyer for such refund amounts. Buyer shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from and against any and all
claims, demands, losses and/or liabilities (including reasonable attorneys
fees and costs) arising as a result of claims by Tenants for refunds owing to
such Tenants (i) allocable to the period prior to Year-End for reconciliation
of CAM Charges to the extent that Seller has paid Buyer or given credit to
Buyer for such refund amounts, and/or (ii) allocable to the period after Year-
End for reconciliation of CAM Charges.

 



-17- __(ii) _Security Deposits._ Buyer shall receive a credit for all
cash security deposits, if any, held by or for Seller under any Leases. Buyer
shall cause such amount to be maintained after the Closing as a security
deposit in accordance with the terms of the applicable Lease and applicable
Law and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller Indemnified Parties from all
Legal Proceedings of Tenants with respect thereto. In the event that Seller
holds any letters of credit as a security deposit under any Lease, then Seller
shall use Reasonable Efforts to cause such letters of credit to be
transferred to Buyer at the Closing or as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter (or, in the event that such letters of credit cannot be
transferred, to be replaced by equivalent letters of credit in favor of
Buyer). Buyer shall bear all costs and expenses required to transfer or
replace any such letters of credit. __

__(iii)  _Ground Leases._ All rent payable under the Ground Leases shall be
prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the Cut-Off Time on an accrual basis,
based on the actual number of days in the month (quarter, year or other
applicable period) during which the Closing Date occurs. Seller shall be
responsible for all rent payable under the Ground Leases attributable by
Seller to the period before the Cut-Off Time and Buyer shall be responsible
for all rent payable under the Ground Leases attributable to the period on
and after Cut-Off Time. In addition, Seller shall be paid by Buyer at the
Closing for then-balances, if any, of all impounds and reserves held under the
Ground Leases (and at the Closing, Buyer shall receive all rights of Seller
thereto). __

__(iv) _Assigned Contracts_. To the extent such amounts are not paid or
payable by Tenants and to the extent not paid or assumed by Buyer pursuant to
other provisions hereof, any amounts prepaid or payable under any Assigned
Contracts, and any advertising expenses, trade association dues and trade
subscriptions shall be prorated as of the Cut-Off Time with Seller obligated
for all sums accrued prior to the Cut-Off Time and Buyer obligated for all
sums accrued after the Cut-Off Time; provided, however, that all amounts
included in CAM expenses shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of
Year-End. All other amounts owed or owing under the Assigned Contracts to the
extent not paid or assumed by Buyer pursuant to other provisions hereof shall
be prorated between Seller and Buyer as of the Cut-Off Time. __

 

 __(v) _Tax Credit._ Buyer shall receive a credit for any accrued but unpaid
Property Taxes imposed in respect of the Shopping Centers, the Real Property
and the other Transferred Assets that are payable after the Closing and
attributable to the portion of the current year which has elapsed prior to the
Cut-Off Time (and to the extent unpaid, for prior years), and Seller shall be
paid by Buyer for any such Taxes in respect of the Shopping Centers, the Real
Property and the other Transferred Assets that are attributable to the portion
of the current year after the Cut-Off Time (and to the extent paid,
for future years) to the extent such Taxes have been paid prior to the Cut-
Off Time. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall be responsible for the
timely payment of any Property Taxes in respect of the Shopping Centers, the
Real Property and the other Transferred Assets due after the Cut-Off Time to
the applicable Tax Authority. If the amount of any __

 



-18-  such Taxes has not been determined as of the Closing, such amount shall be
calculated based on the most recent ascertainable Taxes. Any refunds of such
Taxes shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller based on the portion of the
year in which the Closing occurred that each of them owned (directly or
indirectly) the applicable Shopping Center, Real Property or other Transferred
Assets. In no event shall Seller be charged with or be responsible for any
increase in the Taxes on the Shopping Centers, Real Property or other
Transferred Assets resulting from the sale of the Shopping Centers, Real
Property or other Transferred Assets contemplated by this Agreement or from
any improvements made or leases entered into on or after the Closing Date. If
any assessments on the Shopping Centers, Real Property or other Transferred
Assets are payable in installments, then the installment allocable to the year
in which the Closing Date occurs shall be prorated (with Buyer being
allocated the obligation to pay any installments due after the Cut-Off Time).

 

 __(vi) _Tax Appeal._ Seller may appeal any Property Taxes imposed in respect
of the applicable Shopping Center, Real Property or other Transferred Assets
for any pre-Cut-Off Time period, and any contingency fee charged by any
consultant or other third party pursuing such Tax appeal shall be deducted on
a prorated basis from the refund payable to each of Seller and Buyer. If any
appeal of any Taxes is pending as of the Cut-Off Time with respect to any Tax
period that has closed prior to the Cut-Off Time, Seller shall be entitled to
receive any rebate or credit resulting from such appeal to the extent that
such amounts are not due to Tenants, and shall pay all expenses of
prosecuting such appeal. If any appeal of any Taxes is pending as of the Cut-
Off Time with respect to the period in which the Closing Date occurs ("
_Current Year Tax Appeal_ "), such Taxes shall be re-prorated between Seller
and Buyer as of the Cut-Off Time in accordance with the results of such
Current Year Tax Appeal. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in the prosecution
of each Current Year Tax Appeal. All third-party costs and fees incurred in
connection with any Current Year Tax Appeal, including legal fees and
expenses, shall be paid by Seller to the extent due and payable prior to the
Cut-Off Time, and shall be paid by Buyer to the extent due and payable on or
after the Cut-Off Time, but upon completion of the Current Year Tax Appeal,
all such costs and fees shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller in the same
proportion as they bear the applicable Taxes for such year. __

 

 __(vii) _Utilities._ To the extent such amounts are not paid directly by
Tenants, utilities and fuel, including steam, water, electricity, gas and oil
shall be prorated as of the Cut-Off Time (or for CAM expenses, as of Year-
End). Seller shall use Reasonable Efforts to cause the meters, if any, for
utilities to be read the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and to pay
the bills rendered on the basis of such readings. If any such meter reading
for any utility is not available, then, to the extent practicable, adjustment
therefor shall be made on the basis of the most recently issued bills
therefor which are based on meter readings no earlier than thirty (30) days
prior to the Closing Date, and such adjustment shall be prorated when the next
utility bills are received. Seller shall be paid by Buyer for all deposits
made by or on behalf of Seller as of the Cut-Off Time as security under any
Assigned Contract, utility, public service or other arrangement to the extent
the same remains on deposit for the benefit of Buyer. __

 



-19- __(viii) _Permits._ To the extent such amounts are not paid or payable by
Tenants, Seller shall be paid at Closing for any recurring fees for any Real
Propertys or any Shopping Centers Permits that have been paid by Seller
prior to the Cut-Off Time and relate to the period from and after the Cut-Off
Time, and Buyer shall receive a credit for any such fees which have not been
paid as of the Cut-Off Time and relate to the period prior to the Cut-Off
Time. __

 

 __(ix) _Miscellaneous._ Any other items of operating income or operating
expense which are customarily prorated between the parties in real estate
closings of comparable commercial properties in the metropolitan area where
the applicable Real Property is located shall be prorated between Seller and
Buyer as of the Cut-Off Time on an accrual basis, based on the actual number
of days in the month (quarter, year or other applicable period) during which
the Closing Date occurs. __

__(b) All of the Prorated Items that can be determined or estimated as of the
Cut-Off Time have been so determined or estimated by Seller in the Closing
Statement delivered by Seller to Buyer in respect of the Closing. The Closing
Statement shall include a reasonably detailed breakdown of the Prorated Items
(as applicable, by individual Real Property) and shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with the calculation principles and procedures set forth in Section
2.6(a). Within one-hundred twenty (120) days following the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller an updated proration report and
closing statement (the " _Final Proration Settlement Statement_ ") prepared in
a manner consistent with the calculation principles and procedures set forth
in Section 2.6(a), and proposing adjustments to those Prorated Items and other
items on the Closing Statement (A) that were not apportioned on the Closing
Statement because of the unavailability of information, (B) that were
apportioned on the Closing Statement based upon estimated, inaccurate or
incomplete information, or (C) for which manifest errors existed on the
Closing Statement. Buyer and Seller shall each have the right to have their
respective accountants review drafts of the Final Proration Settlement
Statement such that the Final Proration Settlement Statement accurately
reflects the operations of the applicable Shopping Centers on the
Closing Date, and Buyer shall provide Seller and its Representatives
reasonable access to the applicable Shopping Centers or Buyers principal
place of business where such books and records are maintained to review such
books and records to enable Seller to audit the same with respect to the
Final Proration Settlement Statement. The Parties shall meet to come to a
final determination of the accuracy of Final Proration Settlement Statement
within thirty (30) days (" _Final Proration Period_ ") after the Sellers
receipt of the Final Proration Settlement Statement. Unless any matters remain
in dispute upon the expiration of the Final Proration Period, then within five
(5) days of such expiration, Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall pay
to the other the amount as may be required by the Final Proration Settlement
Statement (the " _True-up Amount_ "), together with interest thereon at the
lesser of two percent (2%) over the "prime rate" (as announced from time to
time in the Wall Street Journal) per annum or the maximum rate allowed by Law,
from the date of demand to the date of payment if payment is not made within
ten (10) days after delivery of a written demand therefor. If any matters
remain in dispute (the " _Unresolved Items_ ") at the expiration of any Final
Proration Period, then KPMG (or, if at the time of such dispute KPMG is
performing audit or other services for either Seller or Buyer, then such
other independent accounting firm of recognized national standing which is not
providing such services to either Seller or Buyer at such time and is
otherwise mutually selected by Seller and Buyer) shall resolve
such Unresolved Items, acting __

 



-20-  as an expert and not an arbitrator, but in no case shall they review or
propose any resolution for any matters that are not Unresolved Items. If
neither KPMG nor any such mutually selected accounting firm is willing and
able to serve in such capacity, then Seller shall within ten (10) days deliver
to Buyer a listing of three other accounting firms of recognized national or
regional standing and Buyer shall within ten (10) days after receipt of such
list, select one of such three accounting firms, _provided_ that the firm
ultimately selected may not be performing audit or other services for either
Seller or Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates at such time (such firm
as is ultimately selected pursuant to the aforementioned procedures being the
" _True-up Accountant_ "). Buyer and Seller shall use their Reasonable Efforts
to cause the True-up Accountant to issue its written determination regarding
the Unresolved Items within thirty (30) days after such Unresolved Items are
submitted for review. The True-up Accountant shall make a determination with
respect to the Unresolved Items only and shall be limited to
those adjustments, if any, that need to be made in order for the Final
Proration Settlement Statement to comply with the standards referred to in
this Section 2.6. In no event shall the True-up Accountants determination of
any Unresolved Items be outside the range of Buyers and Sellers
disagreement. The determination of the True-up Accountant shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. Such amounts as finally
determined by the True-up Accountant shall be used to determine the True-up
Amount, which shall be paid by the applicable Party within five (5) days of
the True-up Accountants determination. Upon payment of the True-up Amount
pursuant to this Section 2.6(b), such True-up Amount shall be deemed final
and binding on the Parties and except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement there shall be no further adjustment between Seller and Buyer for
income and expenses.

 

(c) Buyer and Seller shall share the fees and expenses of the True-up
Accountant incurred under this Section 2.6 in inverse proportion to the
relative amounts of the Unresolved Items determined in favor of such Party, in
accordance with the following formulas: (i) Seller shall pay a portion of such
fees and expenses equal to the total fees and expenses multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the dollar amount of Unresolved Items
resolved in favor of Buyer and the denominator of which is the total dollar
amount of Unresolved Items and (ii) Buyer shall pay a portion of such fees and
expenses equal to the total fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the dollar amount of Unresolved Items resolved in favor
of Seller and the denominator of which is the total dollar amount of
Unresolved Items.

 

Section 2.7 Cost-to-Complete Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a) At the Closing Seller shall deliver an estimated calculation of the Cost-
to-Complete Adjustment Amount based on the information that can be determined
or estimated as of the Cut-Off Time (the " _Estimated Cost-to-Complete Report_
"), which shall include a schedule comparing the Baseline Cost-to-Complete
Budget and estimates of the other components of the Cost-to-
Complete Adjustment Amount. The Estimated Cost-to-Complete Report shall form
a part of the Closing Statement delivered by Seller to Buyer in respect of the
Closing. The Estimated Cost-to-Complete Report shall include a reasonably
detailed breakdown of the Cost-to-Complete Adjustment Amount (as applicable,
by individual Real Property). The Cost-to-Complete Adjustment Amount as set
forth on the Estimated Cost-to-Complete Report is referred to herein as the "
_Estimated Adjustment_." If the Estimated Adjustment is negative, such amount
shall be deducted from the Final Purchase Price paid at Closing. If the
Estimated Adjustment is positive, such amount shall increase the Final
Purchase Price paid at Closing.

 



-21- (b) In furtherance of, and not in limitation of the foregoing, within ninety
(90) days following the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Buyer a statement of the Development Costs actually paid by Seller from and
after the applicable Project Effective Date through December 31, 2014,
including any Cost Savings, but excluding any Development Costs paid by
Seller with respect to Pre-Closing Cost Overruns, the latter of which shall
remain Sellers sole liability (the " _Cost-to-Complete Settlement Statement_
"), which shall be in the same format as Exhibit B attached hereto and shall
include Sellers good faith calculation of the Cost-to-Complete Adjustment
Amount. Seller and Buyer shall each have the right to have their respective
accountants review drafts of the Cost-to-Complete Settlement Statement, and
Seller and Buyer shall each provide the other Party and its Representatives
reasonable access to the applicable Shopping Centers or place of business
where relevant books and records are maintained to review such books
and records to enable Seller to prepare, and Buyer to audit, the Cost-to-
Complete Settlement Statement.

(c) The Parties shall meet to come to a final determination of the accuracy
of Cost-to-Complete Settlement Statement within thirty (30) days after the
Buyers receipt of the Cost-to-Complete Settlement Statement. The final
determination of the Cost-to-Complete Adjustment Amount is referred to as the
" _Final Adjustment_." Unless any matters remain in dispute upon the
expiration of such 30-day period, then within five (5) days of such
expiration, either (i) if the Final Adjustment less the Estimated Adjustment
is negative, Seller shall pay to Buyer the absolute value of such amount, or
(ii) if the Final Adjustment less the Estimated Adjustment is positive, Buyer
shall pay to Seller such amount (either such payment, the " _Cost-to-Complete
Budget True-up Amount_ "). If any matters remain in dispute (the " _Unresolved
Cost-to-Complete Items_ ") at the expiration such 30-day period, then the
True-up Accountant shall resolve such Unresolved Cost-to-Complete Items,
acting as an expert and not an arbitrator, but in no case shall they review or
propose any resolution for any matters that are not Unresolved Cost-to-
Complete Items or relate to a dispute concerning whether Development
Costs constitute Pre-Closing Cost Overruns. Any disputes that are not within
the jurisdiction of the True-Up Accountant are to be decided by reference as
set forth in Section 7.11. The True-up Accountant shall make a determination
with respect to the Unresolved Cost-to-Complete Items only and shall be
limited to those adjustments, if any, that need to be made in order for the
Cost-to-Complete Settlement Statement to comply with the provisions of this
Section 2.7. In no event shall the True-up Accountants determination of any
Unresolved Cost-to-Complete Items be outside the range of Buyers and Sellers
disagreement. The determination of the True-up Accountant shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. Such amounts as finally
determined by the True-up Accountant shall be used to determine the Cost-to-
Complete Budget True-up Amount, which shall be paid by the applicable Party
within five (5) days of the True-up Accountants determination. Upon payment
of the True-up Amount pursuant to this Section 2.7(c), such Cost-to-Complete
Budget True-up Amount shall be deemed final and binding on the Parties and
except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement there shall be no
further adjustment in respect of any budgeted or actual Development Costs
remaining to be paid following the Closing.

 



-22- (d) Buyer and Seller shall share the fees and expenses of the True-up
Accountant incurred under this Section 2.7 in inverse proportion to the
relative amounts of the Unresolved Cost-to-Complete Items determined in favor
of such Party, in accordance with the following formulas: (i) Seller shall pay
a portion of such fees and expenses equal to the total fees and expenses
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the dollar amount of
Unresolved Cost-to-Complete Items resolved in favor of Buyer and the
denominator of which is the total dollar amount of Unresolved Cost-to-
Complete Items and (ii) Buyer shall pay a portion of such fees and expenses
equal to the total fees and expenses multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the dollar amount of Unresolved Cost-to-Complete Items resolved
in favor of Seller and the denominator of which is the total dollar amount of
Unresolved Cost-to-Complete Items.

Section 2.8 Closing Costs.

(a) In connection with the Closing, Seller shall bear the following costs,
fees and expenses: (i) the fees and disbursements of Sellers counsel, and
any other expenses incurred by Seller or its Representatives in closing the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) one-half of all escrow or
closing agent fees, (iii) the cost of the Title Policy premium charged by
Title Company (excluding premiums or other amounts in respect of any extended

modifications (whether for owners or lenders policies, including extended
coverage, but excluding endorsements that Seller is required to pay for
pursuant to Section 2.8(a)), (iv) the cost of conducting all diligence by
Buyer, including the cost of all new or updated property surveys,
environmental reports, property condition reports and other third-party

accordance with local custom, as set forth in Section 2.8(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

(c) At or prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller shall each pay one-half (1/2) of
all sales, use and similar Taxes (and any surtax, interest and penalties
thereon) (collectively, " _Sales Tax_ ") payable as a result of the sale to
Buyer of Furnishings and all other items for which Sales Tax is or may be
payable under applicable Law (collectively, the " _Closing Sales Tax_ "). In
connection with the Closing Sales Tax, Seller shall prepare or obtain all
applicable forms for filing with the appropriate governmental authorities
and/or that Seller determine are necessary or desirable in order to
accurately calculate the Closing Sales Tax, if available (collectively, the "
_Closing Sales Tax Forms_ "), provided that Buyer shall cooperate with Seller
to the extent necessary in connection with the preparation or obtaining of
the Closing Sales Tax Forms. Buyer

 



-23-  shall be responsible for paying the Closing Sales Tax and delivering the
Closing Sales Tax Forms to the appropriate taxing authorities. The term
"Closing Sales Tax Forms" includes, where applicable, such documentation
confirming that the transactions contemplated under this Agreement constitute
an "occasional sale" under applicable Law (with respect to each Shopping
Center, each an " _Occasional Sale Certificate_ "). Seller and Buyer each
agrees to cooperate reasonably in executing such Occasional Sale Certificates,
if necessary under applicable Law.

 

Section 2.9 Diligence; Title and Survey.

 

(a) The Parties expressly agree and acknowledge that prior to the date hereof,
Seller has made available to Buyer with respect to the Real Property and to
the extent in Sellers possession, copies of (i) the Leases and Ground Leases,
(ii) the title insurance commitments relating to each Real Property listed in
Section 2.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (including, in the case of Leased

Permitted Liens. In response to each Title Notice, Seller has notified Buyer
which exceptions to title Seller has cured or caused the Title Company to
insure over, and all other matters identified in the Title Notice that have
not been cured are deemed to constitute Permitted Liens.

 

Section 2.10 Non-Assignable Assets; Further Assurances. Buyer acknowledges
that a portion of the Real Property commonly known as "Lakeside at Canyon
Park" and located in the City of Bothell, Washington (the " _Bothell Property_
"), is subject to a right of first refusal in favor of a third party that
arises in certain circumstances. The portion of the Bothell Property subject
to the right of first refusal is referred to as the " _Bothell ROFR Property_
" and the remainder of the Bothell property is referred to as the " _Bothell

Bothell ROFR Property, the Bothell Property shall be included in the sale
without any modifications.

pre-Closing business or financial operations of Seller to the extent
reasonably necessary or appropriate to be included in any filing made by
Seller or its Affiliates with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission or (z) made in connection with the enforcement of any right or
remedy relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section
5.4(b), Seller and its Representatives shall be deemed to have satisfied their
obligations hereunder with respect to confidential or proprietary information
related to the Real Properties, the Development Assets, the Shopping Centers

(c) Each Party (in the context set forth in this Section 5.4(c), the "
_Receiving Party_ ") shall not, and shall cause its respective
Representatives not to, for a period of three (3) years after the Closing,

of this Section 5.4), (B) independently developed by the Receiving Party or
any of its Affiliates without reference to or use of any such
information disclosed by the Disclosing Party or (C) in the case of Buyer as
the Receiving Party, any information relating to any Transferred Asset which
is obtained by Buyer by virtue of the purchase and sale thereof or (ii)
prohibit any disclosure (x) required by Law so long as, to the extent legally
permissible and feasible, the Receiving Party provides the Disclosing Party
with reasonable prior written notice of such disclosure and a reasonable
opportunity to contest such disclosure or (y) made in

 



-32-  connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Section 5.4(c), the Receiving Party and its
Representatives shall be deemed to have satisfied their obligations hereunder
with respect to confidential or proprietary information of the Disclosing
Party if they exercise the same degree of care (but no less than a reasonable
degree of care) as they take to preserve confidentiality for their own similar
information.

 

Section 5.5 Employee Matters. Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense, bear
all responsibility and liability for Employees wages, vacation pay, paid
time off, expense reimbursements, bonus and incentive payments, severance

sole cost and expense) provide all notices and make all necessary
applications for, and shall thereafter diligently pursue and otherwise take

their Reasonable Efforts to obtain any third-party consents (i) necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (ii) that are
otherwise required to prevent either Buyer or Seller from being unable to

the generality of the foregoing, Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate
with each other to obtain any consents that may be required in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from the counterparties to
any Assigned Contract. In the event that either Party shall fail to obtain
any third-party consent described in the first sentence of this Section
5.7(b), such Party shall use its Reasonable Efforts, and shall take any such
actions reasonably requested by the other Party hereto, to mitigate any
adverse effect upon such other Party, their Affiliates, and their respective
businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, from the
failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party
shall be required to make payments to third parties hereunder in excess of
$100,000 in the aggregate or agree to any limitation on the conduct of its
business, in order to obtain any such consent.

Buyer at Closing, Buyer shall replace them as soon as practicable, but in any
event by January 15, 2015. After the Closing, Buyer will provide reasonable

(a) Subject to any prior payment or reimbursement of Development Costs and to
Section 5.10(b), Seller covenants to promptly pay when due or upon demand by
Buyer (if otherwise due and payable at the time of such demand) all
Development Costs arising on or before December 31, 2014, whether or not such
Development Costs are reflected in the Baseline Cost-to-Complete
Budget, including Pre-Closing Cost Overruns. Prior to the date hereof, Buyer
has received and approved the Development Plans and acknowledges and agrees

Contractor to correct or remedy any construction defects or other work
performed by such Contractor that is not found to be in accordance with its
Development Contract and/or the Development Plans (collectively, the "
_Development Defects_ "). Accordingly, Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees
that Seller shall have no obligation to remedy or correct, or to cause to be
remedied or corrected, any Development Defects from such Contractor, or to
pay for the cost of the remedy or correct any Development Defects of such
Contractor, and Buyer hereby forever and fully waives and releases any right
to make claim upon Seller for the same. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller
shall retain the right to pursue any Contractor for amounts Seller may be
entitled to recover from such Contractor and which relate to any indemnity
obligation Seller may have to Buyer hereunder. Buyer further acknowledges and
agrees that Buyer shall be solely responsible for payment of Development
Costs after December 31, 2014, unless subject to the Cost-to-Complete Purchase
Price Adjustment pursuant to Section 2.7 or attributable to Pre-Closing Cost
Overruns.

revision, amendment, modification or other change or Cost Overrun.

 

Section 5.11 Exchange Cooperation.

 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyer agrees to
cooperate in closing the purchase and sale of a portion of the Transferred
Assets as a deferred like-kind exchange by Seller pursuant to Section 1031 of
the Code by permitting Seller to assign to Stewart Institutional Exchange
Services, LLC or one or more Affiliates, each as a qualified 

 



-35-  intermediary (" _QI_ "), Sellers rights to transfer one or more of the
Transferred Assets and receive the sales proceeds allocable thereto. Prior to
Closing, Seller shall notify Buyer and Title Company of the Transferred
Assets that will be the subject of such exchange or exchanges (the "
_Exchanged Transferred Assets_ "). Immediately following execution of this
Agreement Seller shall provide to Buyer a copy of its assignment to each
party acting as QI and Buyer agrees to execute an acknowledgement of such
assignment or assignments, provided that in no event shall Seller be relieved
of any liability under this Agreement by reason of such assignments. Pursuant
to such assignment or assignments, Buyer shall direct the proceeds allocable
to purchase of the Exchanged Transferred Assets to each assigned QI, pursuant
to instructions to be given by each QI. However, Buyer shall not be required
to bear any escrow, title or other expense in excess of those Buyer would bear
if there were no exchange. Buyer shall not be required to execute any document
creating personal liability or to assume or be exposed to any liability
in connection with the exchange, nor shall the Closing Date be delayed to
consummate any such exchange without the written consent of both Parties. In
no event shall Buyer be required to take title to any property other than the
Transferred Assets and in no event shall Buyer be responsible for any tax
consequences to Seller or any other party in connection with any such
exchange.

(b) Seller agrees and covenants to defend, indemnify, protect and hold
harmless Buyer from any liability, damage, loss, cost and expense (including
reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of any such assignment or exchange,
including any claims by or on behalf of any QI.

Section 5.12 Chase LOI. Both prior to and after the Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be

reasonably practicable. If the Chase LOI is not obtained prior to Closing,

obligations of the Seller and Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall
survive the Closing until the earlier of (i) the delivery of the Chase LOI to
Buyer, and (ii) the date which is ninety (90) days following the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Closing shall
not be conditioned or contingent upon the occurrence of the delivery of the
Chase LOI. In the event the Chase LOI is delivered within ninety (90) days
after Closing, the Buyer shall pay via wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Seller an amount
equal to the Chase Payment within five (5) Business Days of such delivery;
provided, however, that if (x) the annual rent contemplated by the Chase LOI
is less than the annual rent contemplated by the Draft Chase LOI, then the
difference between such rent amounts shall be capitalized at a rate of eight
percent (8%) and the Chase Payment shall be reduced (but not below zero) by
such capitalized amount (i.e., reduced by the dollar difference in annual rent
divided by 0.08), or (y) the Chase Relocation Costs exceed $1,740,000 , the
Chase Payment shall be (1) reduced (but not below zero) by an amount equal to
the increased Chase Relocation Costs and (2) increased (but not in excess of
$2,500,000) by the quotient of the amount, if any, by which annual rent
contemplated by the Chase LOI exceeds the annual rent contemplated by the
Chase Draft LOI divided by 0.08.

Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Losses that Buyer Indemnified
Parties incur to the extent arising from or out of (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Seller in ARTICLE III, (ii) any breach of any
Specified Covenant of Seller in this Agreement, (iii) any breach by Seller of
any Transaction Documents other than this Agreement, (iv) any
Excluded Liability, or (v) any default by Seller alleged in the Required
Estoppels listed in Section 6.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule.

 



-37- (b) Subject to the provisions of this ARTICLE VI, from and after the Closing,
Buyer shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates, and its and their respective
equity holders, officers, directors, managers and employees (" _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Losses that Seller Indemnified
Parties incur to the extent arising from or out of (i) any breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer in ARTICLE IV, (ii) any breach by Buyer of
any of the Specified Covenants applicable to Buyer or (iii) any breach of any
Transaction Documents other than this Agreement or (iv) any Assumed
Liability.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Parties shall have a
duty to use Reasonable Efforts to mitigate any Loss arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.3 Indemnification Procedures. Claims for indemnification under this
Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows: 

(a) Any Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party claiming
indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") with
respect to any claim asserted against the Indemnified Party by a third party
(" _Third-Party Claim_ ") in respect of any matter that is subject to
indemnification under Section 6.2 shall promptly (i) notify the other Party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of the Third-Party Claim and (ii) transmit to
the Indemnifying Party a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Third-Party Claim, a copy of all papers
served with respect to such claim (if any) and the basis of the Indemnified
Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement. Subject to Section
6.1, failure to timely provide such Claim Notice shall not affect the right
of the Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder, except to the extent
(and only to the extent) that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates such failure
shall have caused the Losses (in whole or in part) for which the Indemnifying
Party is obligated to be greater than such Losses would have been had the
Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying Party timely notice.

 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against such Third-Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will notify the
Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) Business Days after having received any
Claim Notice with respect to whether or not it is exercising its right to
defend the Indemnified Party against the Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to defend such Third-Party Claim with counsel
selected by the Indemnifying Party, by all appropriate proceedings, to a
final conclusion or settlement at the discretion of the Indemnifying Party in
accordance with this Section 6.3(b). The Indemnifying Party shall have full
control of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or
settlement thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
not enter into any compromise or settlement of any Third-Party Claim without
the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a
complete and unconditional general release by the third party asserting the
claim to all Indemnified Parties affected by the

 



-38-  claim and (ii) the settlement agreement does not contain any sanction or
restriction upon the conduct of any business by the Indemnified Party or any
admission of guilt or culpability on its behalf. The Indemnified Party may
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party
Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 6.3(b),
and the Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect
to such participation.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party that the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
6.3(b) within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of any Claim Notice or
the Indemnifying Party does not otherwise have the right to defend such claim
pursuant to Section 6.3(b), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right
to defend, and be reimbursed for its reasonable cost and expense (but only if
the Indemnifying Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder) in
regard to the Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnified
Party, by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted
diligently by the Indemnified Party. In such circumstances, the Indemnified
Party shall defend any such Third-Party Claim in good faith and have full
control of such defense and proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Indemnified Party may not enter into any compromise or settlement of such
Third-Party Claim if indemnification is to be sought hereunder, without the
Indemnifying Partys consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying Party may participate in,
but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Section 6.3(c), and the Indemnifying Party shall bear
its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation.

 

(d) If requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (but only if the
Indemnified Party is actually entitled to indemnification hereunder), fully
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in contesting any Third-
Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, including
providing access to documents, records and information. In addition, the
Indemnified Party will make its personnel available at no cost to the
Indemnifying Party for conferences, discovery, proceedings, hearings, trials
or appeals as may be reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. The
Indemnified Party also shall fully cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and
its counsel in the making of any related counterclaim against the Person
asserting the Third-Party Claim or any cross complaint against any Person and
executing powers of attorney to the extent necessary.

(e) Subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE VI, a claim
for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be
asserted by notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought; such
notice describing in reasonable detail the nature of the claim, the amount of
the claim or a reasonably detailed estimate thereof, a copy of all papers
served with respect to such claim (if any), and the basis of the Indemnified
Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement. Subject to Section
6.1, failure to timely provide such notice shall not affect the right of the
Indemnified Partys indemnification hereunder except to the extent (and only
to the extent) that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates such failure shall
have caused the Losses (in whole or in part) for which the Indemnifying Party
is obligated to be greater than such Losses would have been had the
Indemnified Party given the Indemnifying Party timely notice.

 



-39- Section 6.4 Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein:

(a) The Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer for indemnifiable Losses under
_Section 6.2(a)_ until the aggregate amount of all Losses resulting
therefrom exceed $1,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), in which event Sellers
liability respecting any final judgment concerning such Losses shall be for
both (i) the entire amount of Buyers Losses and (ii) Buyers reasonable,
documented, out-of-pocket attorneys fees paid in connection with seeking
indemnification for such Losses; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the
Threshold shall not apply with respect to any indemnifiable Losses arising
from (x) a single event resulting in over $100,000 of Losses to Buyer, (y)
breaches of the covenant contained in Section 5.10 (the " _True-up Covenant_
") or (z) breaches of Sellers obligations under Sections 2.6 and 2.7 and (B)
none of such Losses described in the foregoing clause (A) shall count towards
the satisfaction of the Threshold;

 

(b) in no event shall Sellers aggregate liability arising out of or relating
to Section 6.2(a) exceed the Indemnity Escrow Amount; provided that (i)
Sellers liability with respect to Losses resulting from, arising out of or
relating to breaches of the True-up Covenant shall not be limited to the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, and (ii) any amounts paid to Buyer pursuant to
Section 6.8(b)(iii) or Section 6.8(b)(iv) shall not reduce the Indemnity
Escrow Amount;

(c) in no event shall Seller be liable under Section 6.2(a) for any Losses
arising from the negligence, strict liability of or violation of any Law by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates;

 

(d) the amount of any Loss for which an Indemnified Party claims
indemnification under this Agreement shall be reduced by: (i) any insurance
proceeds actually received by such Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to
such Loss; (ii) in the event such Buyer Indemnified Party failed to mitigate
its Losses in accordance with Section 6.2(c), the amount by which such
Loss would have been reduced had such Buyer Indemnified Party so mitigated
such Loss; and (iii) indemnification or reimbursement payments actually
received by such Buyer Indemnified Party from third parties with respect to
such Loss, _provided_  that such Buyer Indemnified Party shall use Reasonable
Efforts to obtain recoveries from insurers, including title insurers, and
other third parties in respect of this Section 6.4(d);

 

(e) if an Indemnified Party shall recover Losses in respect of a claim of
indemnification under this ARTICLE VI, no other Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover the same Losses in respect of a claim for indemnification;

(f) if the Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party
in respect of any Losses pursuant to Section 6.2 and the Indemnifying Party
could have recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party,
including any provider of insurance (a " _Potential Contributor_ ") based on
the underlying claim asserted against the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified
Party shall assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential
Contributor as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from
the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment;

 



-40- (g) in no event shall Seller be liable under Section 6.2(a) for any Losses
arising from any action or omission take or not taken by Seller at the
request of or with the consent of Buyer;

(h) Seller shall not be liable in respect of any claim for indemnification
under Section 6.2(a) if and to the extent that Buyer has Knowledge as of the
date of this Agreement of the fact, matter, event or circumstance which is the
subject of the claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
Section 6.4(h), Buyer shall be deemed to have Knowledge of the facts, matters,
events and circumstances set forth in the Data Room as of 5:00 P.M. California
time on December 12, 2014 and such other materials specifically disclosed to
Buyer after December 15, 2014 and set forth on the Disclosure Schedule.

Except with respect to (a) any Losses arising out of any breach of any express
representation, warranty, or agreement set forth in this Agreement or any

immaterial. BUYER, FOR ITSELF AND ON BEHALF OF EACH OF ITS AFFILIATES AND ITS
AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, SPECIFICALLY WAIVES THE PROVISIONS OF ANY LEGAL
REQUIREMENT, THE INTENT OF WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS:

OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

in effect notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional
or different Claims or facts, as to which Buyer expressly assumes the risk,
and (z) notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such additional or
different Claims or facts, it is nonetheless Buyers intention, for itself
and on behalf of each of its Affiliates and its and their Representatives, to
fully, finally and forever settle and

unsuspected, as to the Released Claims. Buyer, for itself and on behalf of

Section 6.6 Purchase Price Adjustment. The Parties agree to treat all payments
made pursuant to this ARTICLE VI as adjustments to the Final Purchase Price
for Tax purposes.

Section 6.7 Remedies; Limited Recourse; Limitations on Damages.

(a) The sole and exclusive remedies for breach of the terms and provisions of
this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth
herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be those remedies
available at law or in equity for breach of contract only (as such contractual
remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms
of this Agreement, including the indemnification provisions of this ARTICLE
VI), and the Parties hereby agree that neither Party hereto shall have any
remedies or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort) for any
statements, communications, disclosures, failures to disclose, representation
or warranties not set forth in this Agreement.

(b) Except as set forth in the second sentence of this Section 6.7(b), after
the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy for any and all claims, Losses or
other matters arising under, out of, or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be the rights of indemnification set
forth in this ARTICLE VI only (and in the case of indemnification sought
pursuant to Section 2.6(a)(ii), the rights of indemnification set forth
therein) and no Person will have any other entitlement, remedy or recourse,
whether in contract, tort, strict liability, equitable remedy or otherwise,
it being agreed that all of such other remedies, entitlements and recourse are
expressly waived and released by the Parties to the fullest extent permitted
by Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, the
immediately preceding sentence will not operate to interfere with or impede a
Partys right to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or
injunctive relief) for a breach or threatened breach of the Specified
Covenants, and the Parties expressly acknowledge that any breach or
threatened breach of any such Specified Covenant by the other Party or Parties
shall result in irreparable and continuing damage to the non-breaching Party
or Parties for which no adequate remedy at law 

 



-44-  will exist and that, in the event of any breach of any such covenant, the
non-breaching Party or Parties shall be entitled to injunctive relief,
including specific performance, and to such further and other relief as may
be necessary and proper to ensure compliance by the breaching Party or Parties
with this Agreement, and the Parties consent to the entry of such relief,
without necessity of posting bond or other security (any requirements
therefore being expressly waived). The Parties acknowledge that the provisions
of this Section 6.7(b) are reasonably necessary and commensurate with the need
to protect the Parties against irreparable harm and to protect
their legitimate business interests.

(c) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE,
OR OTHERWISE REQUIRED TO INDEMNIFY, FOR, AND THE DEFINITION OF LOSSES SHALL
NOT INCLUDE, ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST BENEFITS, LOSS OF
ENTERPRISE VALUE, DIMINUTION IN VALUE OR MULTIPLES OF EARNINGS OF ANY
BUSINESS, DAMAGE TO REPUTATION OR LOSS TO GOODWILL, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OTHER LAW OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR NOT ARISING FROM
ANY OTHER PARTYS SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR
OTHER FAULT EXCEPT, WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFINITION OF LOSSES, TO THE EXTENT
SUCH DAMAGES ARE ACTUALLY AWARDED TO A GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY OR ANOTHER THIRD
PARTY; PROVIDED THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATION SHALL NOT LIMIT SELLERS
RIGHT TO RECOVER THE DEPOSIT IN CONNECTION WITH BUYERS FAILURE TO CLOSE IN
VIOLATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

(d) All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or
in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement,
or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as
an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only against the
entities that are expressly named as Parties hereto. No Person that is not a
named party to this Agreement, including any past, present or future
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or Representative of any named party to this
Agreement (" _Non-Party Affiliate_ ") shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based on any theory that seeks
to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for
any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
this Agreement or its negotiation or execution, and each Party waives and
releases all such liabilities and claims against any such Non-Party
Affiliates.

 

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.7 were specifically bargained-for between
Seller and Buyer and were taken into account by Seller and Buyer in arriving
at the Initial Purchase Price. Each of Seller and Buyer specifically relied
upon the provisions of this Section 6.7 in agreeing to the Initial Purchase
Price and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties
set forth in ARTICLE III (in the case of Seller) and ARTICLE IV (in the case
of Buyer).

twelve (12) months after the Closing Date in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement, and on the date that is three
(3) Business Days after the twelve (12) month period commencing on the Closing

Indemnity Escrow Agreement.

waives any right (a) to require that any resort be had by Buyer against Seller
for any of Seller Guaranteed Obligations or (b) to sureties or guarantors

assert or take advantage of any such right. In connection with Seller
Guaranteed Obligations, Seller Parent hereby represents and warrants to Buyer
that the value of the consideration received, and to be received, by Seller
Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated under the Agreement is
worth at least as much as the liabilities and obligations of Seller Parent
under this Section 7.10(a), and that such liabilities and obligations are
expected to benefit Seller Parent either directly or indirectly.

 



-49- (b) Seller Parent waives Seller Parents or other suretys rights of
subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution and other
rights, benefits and defenses, if any, otherwise available to Seller Parent

2855, inclusive, 2899 or 3433 and any rights, benefits or defenses resulting
from alteration, impairment or suspension in any respect or by any means of
any of Sellers obligations under this Agreement or any of Buyers rights or
remedies under this Agreement without Seller Parents prior consent (subject
to the Guaranty Cap set forth above).

 

(c) Seller Parent represents and warrants that is has all requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform all its
obligations hereunder, that the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized and approved by all requisite action on the part of Seller,
that this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by
Seller Parent and constitutes a legally valid and binding obligation of Seller
Parent, enforceable against Seller Parent in accordance with its terms, in
each case, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting creditors
rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of
equity, and that no consent, waiver, approval, order, Permit or authorization
of, or declaration or filing with, or notification to, any Governmental
Authority is required on the part of Seller Parent in connection with the
execution and delivery by Seller Parent of this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

fees and costs, in conformance with Section 7.11(g). Each of the Parties
hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the California Superior Court in the

another and the Referee, and shall perform such acts as may be necessary to
obtain a prompt and expeditious resolution of the dispute in accordance with
the terms thereof.

costs incurred by the Referee in connection with the services rendered in the
