ARTICLE I.

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.01 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.01_, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
on or before the date that is ten (10) Business Days after the date of the
initial public announcement of this Agreement (but in no event earlier than
five (5) Business Days after the date of the initial public announcement of
this Agreement), commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the
Offer.

 

(b) The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub to,
accept for payment and pay for any Shares pursuant to the Offer is subject to
the terms and the satisfaction or waiver (as provided in _Section 1.01(c)_
below) of the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ ")
(without limiting the right of Merger Sub to terminate, extend or modify the
Offer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement). On the terms and
subject to the conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall,
and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Tendered Shares_ ") as soon as practicable after the Expiration Date (as
defined below) and in compliance with applicable Law (as defined below). The
acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to and subject to the conditions of
the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the
date and time at which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Acceptance Time_." Parent shall provide, or cause to be
provided, to Merger Sub on the date of the Offer Closing funds necessary to
purchase and pay for any and all Shares that Merger Sub becomes obligated to
accept for payment and purchase pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement.

(c) The Offer Conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub,
and Parent and Merger Sub may waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition
at any time and from time to time, in their sole and absolute discretion,
other than the Minimum Condition, which may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub
only with the prior written consent of the Company. Parent and Merger Sub
expressly reserve the right to waive any of the Offer Conditions, to increase
the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of
the Offer; _provided_ that, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or
previously approved by the Company in writing, Parent and Merger Sub shall
not: (i) decrease the Offer Price or change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, (ii) decrease the number of Shares sought to be purchased in
the Offer, (iii) impose conditions on the Offer in addition to the Offer
Conditions or amend any Offer Condition, (iv) waive or amend the Minimum
Condition, (v) amend any other term of the Offer in a manner that is adverse
to the holders of Shares, or (vi) extend the Expiration Date (as defined
below) except as required or permitted by _Section 1.01(e)_.

 



2 (d) On the date the Offer is commenced, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which Tender Offer Statement shall include an offer to purchase, letter
of transmittal, summary advertisement and other required ancillary offer
documents (such Schedule TO and the documents included therein pursuant to
which the Offer will be made, together with any supplements or amendments
thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ") and cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the holders of Shares as and to the extent required by
applicable Law. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion of the
recommendation of the Company Board that the Companys stockholders accept
the Offer and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer (the " _Company Board
Recommendation_ ") in the Offer Documents. Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, cause the Offer Documents to comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of applicable Law. The Company shall
promptly furnish to Parent and Merger Sub all information concerning the
Company and the holders of Shares that may be required to be set forth in the
Offer Documents or reasonably requested in connection with any action
contemplated by this _Section 1.01(d)_, including communication of the Offer
to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Each of the parties agrees to
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading
in any material respect, and Parent and Merger Sub further agree to take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Shares, in each case as and to the
extent required by applicable Law. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel in writing with any written comments (and shall
orally describe any oral comments) that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments. Prior to the filing
of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with
the SEC or dissemination thereof to the holders of Shares, or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide the Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such Offer Documents or response, and Parent and Merger Sub shall
give reasonable consideration to any comments provided by the Company. Parent
and Merger Sub shall use reasonable best efforts to respond promptly to any
such SEC comments.

(e) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, the
Offer shall remain open until midnight, New York City time, at the end of the
20th business day (for purposes of this _Section 1.01(e)_ calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) after the date that
the Offer is commenced (the " _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or, if the period
of time for which the Offer is open shall have been extended pursuant to, and
in accordance with, this _Section 1.01(e)_ or as may be required by
applicable Law, the time and date to which the Offer has been so extended
(the Initial Expiration Date or such later time and date to which the Offer
has been extended in accordance with this _Section 1.01(e)_, the "
_Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if, on the then-
effective Expiration Date, any of the Offer Conditions have not been satisfied
or waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the
Offer for successive periods of not more than ten (10) Business Days (as
defined below) (the length of such period to be determined by Merger Sub), or
for such longer period as the parties may agree, in order to permit the
satisfaction of the Offer Conditions (it being understood, for the avoidance
of doubt, that the Offer shall not be extended pursuant to this _clause (i)_
if all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived), and (ii) Merger Sub
shall, 

 



3  and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or its
staff applicable to the Offer or necessary to resolve any comments of the SEC
or its staff applicable to the Offer or the Offer Documents; _provided_ that,
in the case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , Merger Sub shall not in any event
be required to, and without the Companys prior written consent shall not,
extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date (as defined below). Nothing in this
_Section 1.01(e)_ shall be deemed to impair, limit or otherwise restrict in
any manner the right of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to the terms hereof, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day
of such termination) terminate the Offer. If the Offer is terminated or
withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.01_, prior to the acceptance for payment of Shares tendered in
the Offer, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, promptly
return, and shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to
return, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof.

 

Section 1.02 _Company Action_.

 

(a) The Company shall file with the SEC, as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC (and in any event within
five (5) Business Days after the Offer Documents are filed with the SEC), a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 pertaining to the
Offer (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the "
_Schedule 14D-9_ ") that contains the Company Board Recommendation, the
fairness opinions of the Companys financial advisors referenced in _Section
4.21_ and the notice and other information required by Section 262(d)(2) of
the Corporation Law, and shall promptly disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to the
holders of Shares as and to the extent required by applicable Law, including
by setting the Stockholder List Date (as defined below) as the record date for
the purpose of receiving the notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the
Corporation Law. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of applicable Law. Parent
and Merger Sub shall as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and Merger Sub
that may be required or reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in
the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the parties agrees to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and the
Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule
14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders
of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Law. The
Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel in writing with
any written comments (and shall orally describe any oral comments) that the
Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments.
Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (including any amendment or
supplement thereto) with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the holders of
Shares, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule
14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent and Merger Sub with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the
Company shall give reasonable consideration to any comments provided by Parent
or Merger Sub. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond
promptly to any such SEC comments.

 



4 (b) The Company shall reasonably promptly after the date hereof provide to
Parent, or cause to be provided to Parent, a list of the holders of Shares as
well as mailing labels and any available listing or computer file containing
the names and addresses of all record and beneficial holders of Shares and
lists of securities positions of Shares held in stock depositories, in each
case accurate and complete as of the most recent practicable date and shall
promptly furnish Merger Sub with such additional information and assistance
(including updated lists of the record and beneficial holders of Shares,
mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Merger Sub or its agents
may reasonably request in order to communicate the Offer to the holders of
Shares (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the
Offer Documents and Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _Stockholder
List Date_ "). Except as required by applicable Law, and except as necessary
to communicate regarding the Offer and the Merger with the holders of Shares,
Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective representatives) shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files,
shall use such information solely in connection with the Offer and the Merger,
and, if this Agreement is terminated or the Offer is otherwise terminated,
shall promptly deliver or cause to be delivered to the Company or destroy all
copies of such information, labels, listings and files then in their
possession or in the possession of their representatives.

(c) The Company shall register (and shall instruct its transfer agent to
register) the transfer of the Shares accepted for payment by Merger Sub
effective immediately after the Acceptance Time.

ARTICLE III.

 

CONSIDERATION; PAYMENT FOR SHARES, OPTIONS AND WARRANTS

 

Section 3.01 _Conversion of Shares; Cancellation of Treasury Shares and
Parent-Owned Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any
Subsidiary (as defined below) of Parent or held in the treasury of the
Company, and other than Dissenting Shares (as defined below), which shall have
only those rights set forth in _Section 3.09_) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the holders thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into the right to
receive in cash an amount per Share (subject to any applicable withholding
Tax) equal to the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), upon the
surrender of the Certificates (as defined below) or Book-Entry Shares (as
defined below), as applicable, in accordance with this _Article III_. At the
Effective Time all such Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
Certificates or Book Entry Shares (in each case representing such Shares)
shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as

 



6  provided herein. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is at such time owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any
Subsidiary of Parent or held in the treasury of the Company shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or the holders thereof, be canceled and shall cease to exist at the
Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

Section 3.02 _Conversion of Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common
stock, $0.01 par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders thereof,
be converted at the Effective Time into and become one (1) share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.03 _Payment for Shares_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, deposit, or cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") sufficient funds to make the aggregate payments of the
Merger Consideration due pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_ (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, in each case shall not include the Option Payoff Amount or
the Merger Consideration payable with respect to Restricted Stock Units) (such
amount being hereinafter referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Paying
Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, make the payments provided
for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund may be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation;  _provided_ , that (x) no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares
pursuant to this Agreement, (y) following any such losses that result in the
amount of funds in the Payment Fund being insufficient to promptly pay the
portion of the aggregate Merger Consideration that remains unpaid, Parent
shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent to the extent of
such insufficiency, and (z) such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investment shall be paid solely to Parent. The Payment Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within three (3)
Business Days, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, was the record holder of Shares whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section 3.01_: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the "
_Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to
the Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or non-certificated
Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") in exchange for the
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares. Following surrender to the Paying Agent of
a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, together with such letter of transmittal
duly executed, and such other documents as may be required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry 

 



7  Shares shall be paid in exchange therefor cash in an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding Tax) equal to the product of the number of Shares
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares multiplied by the Merger
Consideration, and such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall forthwith be
canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If
payment is to be made to a Person (as defined below) other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or otherwise in proper form for transfer. From and after the Effective Time
and until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
3.03_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Shares (other than Certificates and
Book-Entry Shares representing any Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all
purposes solely the right to receive, in accordance with the terms hereof, the
Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares evidenced by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, without any interest thereon.

(c) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly
represented thereby.

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares for six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of
Certificates and/or Book-Entry Shares who have not complied with this _Section
3.03_ prior to the end of such six (6) month period shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) but only as general creditors thereof for payment of their
claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. None of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be
liable to any holder of Shares for any amounts (whether in respect of such
Shares or otherwise) delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. If any Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered
prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, any such Merger
Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such time become the property of Parent, free and clear of all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(e) All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with the terms of this  _Article III_ shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 



8 Section 3.04 _Closing of the Company s Transfer Books_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer
of Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided
in this _Article III_.

Section 3.05 _Company Options and Restricted Stock Units_.

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding and unexercised stock option to purchase Shares (collectively,
the " _Company Options_ ") granted pursuant to the Companys 2004 Equity
Incentive Award Plan or the 2010 Amendment and Restatement of the Companys
2006 Equity Incentive Award Plan (together, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "),
shall (i) vest in full, and (ii) automatically be canceled and terminated as
of the Effective Time (to the extent not exercised prior to the Effective
Time), and the holder thereof shall become entitled to receive an amount of
cash, if any, from the Surviving Corporation equal to the product of (A) the
total number of Shares underlying such Company Option multiplied by (B) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share
of such Company Option without interest and subject to any applicable
withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be withheld in
accordance with _Section 3.07_ (the " _Option Payoff Amount_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price per Share of any Company Option,
whether vested or unvested as of the Effective Time, is equal to or greater
than the Merger Consideration, then by virtue of the occurrence of
the Effective Time and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the holders thereof, the Company
Option will automatically terminate and be canceled without payment of any
consideration to the holder thereof.

(b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each then-
outstanding restricted stock unit awarded pursuant to any Company Stock Plan
(collectively, the " _Restricted Stock Units_ ") other than any Restricted
Stock Unit issued or awarded on or after January 1, 2014 (such Restricted
Stock Units collectively, the " _Specified Restricted Stock Units_ ") shall
automatically become fully vested and the restrictions thereon shall lapse,
and each such Restricted Stock Unit shall be canceled and converted into the
right to receive an amount in cash from the Surviving Corporation equal to
the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of
Shares subject to such Restricted Stock Unit, without interest and subject to
any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to be
withheld in accordance with _Section 3.07_.

(c) At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding Specified Restricted Stock
Unit shall be canceled and converted into an award (a " _Converted Award_ ")
representing the right to receive an amount in cash from the Surviving
Corporation equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration multiplied
by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Specified Restricted Stock Unit.
The Converted Award shall continue to vest and be settled in cash in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Specified Restricted Stock Unit
award agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that any unvested portion of the
Converted Award shall vest in full if, following the Effective Time, the
employment of the holder of such Converted Award is terminated in a manner
giving rise to severance benefits under the severance plan or agreement
applicable to such holder, each as in effect on the date of grant.

 



9 (d) Parent shall (i) cause the Surviving Corporation to make payments of the
Option Payoff Amounts and Merger Consideration payable with respect to
Restricted Stock Units to all holders of Company Options and Restricted Stock
Units, as applicable, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,
and in any event, within five (5) Business Days thereafter, and (ii) provide,
or cause to be provided, to the Surviving Corporation sufficient funds to make
such payments.

 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, and in any
event prior to the Initial Expiration Date, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to terminate
each of the Company Stock Plans and to effectuate all of the actions
contemplated by this  _Section 3.05_, contingent on the Closing of the
Merger.

Section 3.06 _Company Warrants_. As soon as reasonably practicable following
the date hereof, and in any event at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Initial Expiration Date, the Company shall (a) provide a written notice of a
request (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent) pursuant to
Section 1.6.2 of each of the unexercised and unexpired warrants to purchase
Shares under the warrant agreements entered into by the Company and the
warrant holders party thereto (collectively, the " _Company Warrants_ "),
such that any Warrant that is not exercised shall expire pursuant to its terms
prior to the Closing, and (b) provide copies of all such written requests to
Parent at the time they are provided to such holders.

 

Section 3.07 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, such
amounts as are required to be withheld under the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any applicable provision of state,
local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. 

Section 3.08 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, during the
period between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the number of
outstanding Shares shall be changed into a different number of Shares or a
different class as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend, recapitalization or other
similar transaction, then the Offer Price and the Merger Consideration shall
be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to reflect such change; _provided_
, that in any case, nothing in this _Section 3.08_ shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 3.09 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and that are held by stockholders who are properly
demanding appraisal rights pursuant to, and who are complying in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the Corporation Law (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be converted into the right to
receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to the holders of
Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the Corporation Law, unless and
until such holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal under Section 262 of
the Corporation Law.

 



10  Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the
Corporation Law. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal, such holders Shares
shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right
to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right
to appraisal shall have been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give
Parent and Merger Sub (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal
of any Shares (or written threats thereof), withdrawals of such demands and
any other instruments served pursuant to the Corporation Law and received by
the Company relating to rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting
Shares, and (b) the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the Corporation Law.
The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisals of capital stock of the Company, offer to settle or settle any
such demands, approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

 

Section 3.10 _Subsequent Actions_. The parties agree to take all necessary
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable
following the Offer Closing without a meeting of the Companys stockholders,
as provided in Section 251(h) of the Corporation Law. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be
advised that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise the Surviving Corporations right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties, privileges,
franchises or assets of the Company as a result of, or in connection with, the
Merger, or otherwise to carry out the intent of this Agreement, the officers
and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company, all such deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of the Company or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under such rights, properties,
privileges, franchises or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to
carry out the intent of this Agreement.

Except (a) as set forth in the section or subsection, as applicable, of
Article IV of the disclosure letter dated the date hereof and delivered by
the Company to Parent with respect to this Agreement prior to the execution
hereof (the " _Disclosure Letter_ ") that specifically corresponds to such
Section or subsection, as applicable, of this _Article IV_ (or in any other
section of _Article IV_ of the Disclosure Letter if the applicability of such
disclosure to such Section or subsection, as applicable, of this Article IV is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure) or (b) as disclosed in
the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by the
Company with the SEC or furnished by the Company to the SEC (including items
incorporated by reference therein) since January 1, 2013 and publicly

any disclosures contained under the captions "Risk Factors" or "Forward
Looking Statements" or similarly titled captions and any other 

 



11  disclosures contained therein that are cautionary or forward-looking in
nature (provided that this _clause (b)_ shall not be applicable to _Section
4.02_ and  _Section 4.03(a)))_, the Company represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Sub that the following are true and correct:

 

Section 4.01 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company is a duly organized
and validly existing corporation in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware, with all corporate power and authority to own its properties and
conduct its business as currently conducted. The Company is duly qualified or
licensed to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation
authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in which the character
of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the nature of the
business transacted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except to the extent the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the
Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws (and all amendments thereto)
as currently in effect. The Company does not, directly or indirectly, own any
interest in any other Person.

 

Section 4.02 _Capitalization_. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share

pursuant to outstanding Company Warrants. Except as set forth in the
preceding sentence, at the close of business on the Capitalization Date, no

the Company were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. From and after
the Capitalization Date until and including the date hereof, the Company has
not issued any shares of its capital stock, has not granted any options,
restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, warrants
or rights or entered into any other agreements or commitments to issue any
shares of its capital stock, or granted any other awards in respect of any
shares of its capital stock and has not split, combined or reclassified any of
its shares of capital stock. All of the outstanding Shares are, and all
Shares that may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be, when issued,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not subject
to preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible
into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters
on which holders of Common Stock may vote (the " _Voting Company Debt_ "). 
_Section 4.02_ of the Disclosure Letter contains a true, correct and complete

Restricted Stock Unit, and (ii) the name of each holder of Company Warrants,
the number of Shares such holder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of
each Company Warrant and the corresponding exercise price and the expiration
date of each Company Warrant. The Company has provided to Parent prior to the
date hereof true, accurate and complete copies of each Company Warrant. Except
for the Company Options, the Restricted Stock Units and the Company Warrants
and for changes since the Capitalization Date resulting from (x) the exercise
of Company Options outstanding on such date or issued after such date as and
to the extent permitted by _Section 6.01_ or the exercise of Company Warrants
outstanding on such date, and (y) the vesting and settlement of the
Restricted Stock Units outstanding on such date or issued after such date as

the Company to issue, or other obligations of the Company to issue, any

the economic equivalent thereof), (C) obligations of the Company to grant,
extend or enter into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or
exchangeable security or other similar agreement or commitment relating to
any capital stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in the

shares or units, contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or

collectively as " _Company Securities_ "). There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company to purchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any Company Securities. There are no voting trusts or other agreements

of capital stock of the Company. All outstanding securities of the Company
have been offered and issued in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable securities Laws, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the " _Securities Act_ ") and "blue sky" Laws.

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority, and has taken
all corporate action necessary, to execute, deliver and perform its

use any Company Material IP, (iii) all agreements that contain covenants not
to sue with respect to any Company Material IP, and (iv) a list of all
Registered IP, including current ownership information and
application/registration number, which is the subject of Third-Party IP
Licenses or agreements described in _clauses (ii)_ through _(iv)_ of this
_Section 4.14(b)_.

(c) As of the date hereof, no cancellation, interference, opposition,
reissue, reexamination or other similar proceeding is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, in which the validity, enforceability,
scope or ownership of any Company Registered IP, or to the Knowledge of the
Company, any Exclusively Licensed Registered IP, is being contested or
challenged (other than office actions or similar communications issued by any
Governmental Entity in the ordinary course of prosecution of any pending
applications for registration of any such Company Registered IP). To the
Knowledge of the Company, each of the patents and patent applications included
in the Company Registered IP and the Exclusively Licensed Registered IP
claiming the Key Product identifies by name each inventor of the claims
thereof as determined in accordance with applicable Law of the jurisdiction in
which such patent is issued or such patent application is pending. As of the
date hereof, (i) all registration, renewal, maintenance and other
similar payments that are or have become due with respect to (A) any Company
Registered IP, (B) any Exclusively Licensed Registered IP, to the extent the
Company is responsible for the prosecution or maintenance of such Exclusively
Licensed Registered IP or the costs thereof (together with the Company
Registered IP, the " _Company Managed IP_ "), and (C) to the Knowledge of the
Company, any Key Patents, in each case have been timely paid by or on behalf
of the Company or, in the case of _clause (C)_ , the applicable patent
holder, as applicable, and (ii) the Company Managed IP which is owned by the
Company and the Exclusively Licensed Registered IP is, and to the Knowledge of
the Company the other Company Managed IP which is exclusively licensed by the
Company is, subsisting and is valid and enforceable and in full force and
effect and has not lapsed (except for any patents within the Company Managed
IP having lapsed or expired at the end of their statutory term), been
abandoned, been disclaimed, been cancelled or been forfeited, except in each
case of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ for such exceptions as have not resulted
in, or would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse impact (commercial
or otherwise) on the Key Product.

 

(d) The Company solely and exclusively owns all right, title and interest in
and to the Owned Company IP and holds a valid and enforceable written license
to use all Licensed Company IP, in each case, free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens) and, immediately following the Effective Time,
the Company will have the same rights thereto as it had prior to the
Effective Time, except, in each case, as individually or in the aggregate,
has not resulted in and would not reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse impact (commercial or otherwise)
on the Key Product;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing is not a
representation of non-infringement, non-misappropriation or other non-
violation of the Intellectual Property of another Person, which representation
is solely set forth in 

 



23   _Section 4.14(f)_ below. Since January 1, 2012, the Company has not
received a written notice from any third party (including any employee or
consultant) pursuant to which such third party claims to own or have any
right or interest in or to (other than any inalienable moral right or any
other inalienable right or interest retained pursuant to applicable Law), or
to have any right to receive any royalty or other material payment for the
Companys use or exploitation of, any Company Material IP. The Company owns,
or holds a valid and enforceable written license or other right to use, all
Intellectual Property necessary for, used in or held for use in the
conduct of the Companys business as currently conducted, except for such
exceptions as have not resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a
material adverse impact (commercial or otherwise) on the Key Product;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing is not a representation of non-
infringement, non-misappropriation or other non-violation of the Intellectual
Property of another person, which representation is solely set forth in
_Section 4.14(f)_ below. To the Knowledge of the Company, all assignments
made to the Company for any Company Material IP are valid and enforceable and
have been recorded in compliance with applicable Law.

(e) None of the Company Material IP which is owned or purported to be owned by
the Company or Exclusively Licensed Registered IP, and to the Knowledge of
Company none of the other Company Material IP which is licensed pursuant to
any Third Party IP Licenses, is subject to any pending or outstanding
injunction, directive, order, decree, award, settlement, judgment or
other disposition of dispute that would reasonably be expected to adversely
restrict the use, transfer, registration or licensing of any such Company
Material IP by the Company or any of its Affiliates (or Parent and its
Affiliates from and after the Effective Time), or otherwise would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the validity, enforceability or scope of any
such Company Material IP, except in for such exceptions as have not resulted
in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse impact (commercial
or otherwise) on the Key Product. The Company has not received notice from any
Person requesting the Company to (nor does the Company have any reason to
believe that it will be required to) indemnify, defend or hold harmless such
Person with respect to any losses resulting from or arising from the Company
Material IP.

 

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, during the last six (6) years, the
operation of the business of the Company as it has been conducted has not
and, as currently conducted, does not, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise
violate any Intellectual Property owned by another Person, except as has not
resulted in and would not reasonably be expected to result in, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse impact
(commercial or otherwise) on the Key Product. During the last six (6) years,
(i) no Legal Proceeding has been asserted or pending or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened against the Company relating to any infringement,
misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual Property of another Person
by the Company except as has not resulted in and would not reasonably be
expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect or a material adverse impact (commercial or otherwise) on the Key
Product and (ii) the Company has not received any written notice (including
any written offers to license) alleging any infringement, misappropriation or
violation of any Intellectual Property of another Person by the Company except
as has not resulted in and would not reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a
material adverse impact (commercial or otherwise) on the Key Product. To the
Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company Material IP is subject to any
pending or outstanding injunction, directive, order, decree, award, settlement
or judgment that would reasonably be expected to restrict the ownership, use,
validity, enforceability or scope of any such Intellectual Property.

 



24 (g) To the Knowledge of the Company, no other Person has, since December 31,
2007, infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated any Company Material
IP, except as has not resulted in and would not reasonably be expected to
result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a
material adverse impact (commercial or otherwise) on the Key Product.

(h) Each Person (including employees, consultants and third parties) who is or
was involved in the creation or development of any Company Material IP which
is owned or purported to be owned by the Company has signed a valid,
enforceable agreement containing an assignment of the applicable Intellectual
Property to the Company and reasonable confidentiality provisions protecting
such Company Material IP which, to the Knowledge of the Company, has not been
breached by such Person. The Company has taken commercially reasonable actions
to maintain the confidentiality of the information held by the Company or the
applicable licensor, or purported to be held by the Company, which it deems a
Trade Secret. To the Knowledge of the Company, no Trade Secrets included in
the Company Material IP have been disclosed to or used by any Person except
pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement which, to the Knowledge of the Company,
has not been breached by any such Person.

(i) To the Knowledge of the Company, no funding, facilities or personnel of
any Governmental Entity or any university, college, research institute or
other educational institution has been used to create any Company Material IP,
except for any such funding or use of facilities or personnel that has not
resulted in such Governmental Entity or institution obtaining any rights of
ownership or use of such Company Material IP.

 

(j) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not (i) result in the loss of, or otherwise adversely affect, any rights of
the Company in any Intellectual Property, (ii) grant or require the Company to
grant to any Person any rights with respect to any Company Material IP, (iii)
subject the Company to any increase in royalties or other payments in respect
of any Intellectual Property, (iv) by the terms of any agreement to which the
Company is a party, diminish any royalties or other payments the Company would
otherwise be entitled to in respect of any Intellectual Property or (v)
result in the breach or, by the terms of such agreement, termination of any
agreement relating to Intellectual Property, except in each case as would not
reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse impact (commercial or
otherwise) on the Key Product.

(k) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company holds valid
and enforceable written licenses to use the Key Patents free and clear of all
Liens and the license agreements with respect to the Key Patents are in full
force and effect and the Company has not taken any action, or omitted to take
any action, which would constitute a breach of those license agreements.
Immediately following the Effective Time, the Key Patents will be available
for use by the Surviving Corporation and the Surviving Corporation will have
the same rights to the Key Patents as the Company had prior to Effective
Time. To the Knowledge of the Company, the

 



25  Key Patents are subsisting and valid and enforceable and in full force and
effect and have not lapsed and there is no information, materials, facts or
circumstances, including any information or fact which would constitute prior
art to any of the Key Patents, or that would render any of the Key Patents not
subsisting or invalid or unenforceable or not in full force and effect or that
would result in the lapsing of any of the Key Patents. To the Knowledge of
the Company, with respect to any currently pending or filed reexamination
proceeding at the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to the
Key Patents, all relevant material information for such reexamination
proceeding, including but not limited to prior art, litigation documents,
testing data, and the like, has been or will be timely submitted to the United
States Patent and Trademark Office, except in each case for such exceptions as
have not resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or a material
adverse impact (commercial or otherwise) on the Key Product.

Shares (other than Dissenting Shares, Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or

Section 4.22 _State Takeover Statutes Inapplicable; Rights Agreement_. The
Company Board has taken all action necessary so that (assuming the accuracy of

transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate or similar action
on the part of each of Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate or

and delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub nor the consummation of

with any provisions herein will (a) violate, contravene or conflict with or
result in any breach of any provision of the respective Certificate of

give rise to any such right) under any of the terms, conditions or provisions
of any note, license, agreement, contract, indenture or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective assets may be bound, or (d) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or by which any of their respective assets are bound,
except in the case of _clauses (b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
No vote of Parents stockholders is necessary to approve this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



34 Section 5.05 _Litigation_. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, as of the date hereof
(a) there is no Legal Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against or relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and (b)
neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding
order, writ, injunction or decree.

 

Section 5.06 _Interested Stockholder_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has been at any time during the period commencing three (3)
years prior to the date that the Company Board approved this Agreement through
the date hereof, an "interested stockholder" of the Company, as such term is
defined in Section 203 of the Corporation Law. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
own any Shares as of the date hereof.

Section 5.07 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a correct and complete copy of (i) an
executed commitment letter, dated as of the date hereof (as amended,
modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time after the date
hereof in compliance with _Section 6.13_, the " _Commitment Letter_ "), from
the lenders party thereto (including any lenders who become party thereto by
joinder) (collectively, the " _Lenders_ ") and other arrangers party thereto,
pursuant to which the Lenders have agreed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to provide the debt amounts set forth therein (the debt financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, together with any permitted Alternative
Debt Financing, is collectively referred to herein as the " _Debt Financing_
") and (ii) the fee letter referred to in the Commitment Letter (with only
fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic terms redacted (none of which
would adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing)) (as
amended, modified, supplemented, replaced or extended from time to time
after the date hereof in compliance with _Section 6.13_, the " _Fee Letter_
").

(b) Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter (or in the
unredacted portions of the Fee Letter) delivered to the Company, as of the
date hereof, there are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the
Lenders to provide the Debt Financing or any contingencies that would permit
the Lenders to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing. There are no
other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Debt Financing
to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the date hereof
which would impose conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the
full amount of the Debt Financing, other than those set forth in the
Commitment Letter (or in the unredacted portions of the Fee Letter). As of the
date hereof, Parent does not have any reason to believe that it will be
unable to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to be satisfied by it in
the Commitment Letter or the Fee Letter at the time it is required to
consummate the Merger Closing hereunder, nor does Parent have Knowledge, as
of the date hereof, that any of the Lenders will not perform their respective
funding obligations under the Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms
and conditions.

 



35 (c) Each of the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter is a valid, binding and
enforceable obligation of Parent and Merger Sub and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto, is in full force and effect, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy Laws, other similar Laws affecting
creditors rights and general principles of equity affecting the availability
of specific performance and other equitable remedies. As of the date hereof,
no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both,
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure
to satisfy a condition precedent on the part of Parent or Merger Sub or, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto under the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letter or under the Fee Letter. Parent has paid
in full any and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant
to the terms of the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter on or before the date
hereof, and will pay in full any such amounts due on or before the Closing
Date. The Commitment Letter and Fee Letter have not been modified, altered or
amended on or prior to the date hereof. None of the commitments under the
Commitment Letter have been withdrawn or rescinded prior to the date hereof.

 

(d) The proceeds of the Debt Financing, if funded, together with available
cash of Parent and Merger Sub, shall constitute sufficient funds for the
satisfaction of all of Parents and Merger Subs obligations under this
Agreement on the Closing Date, including the payment of the Offer Price in
respect of each Share validly tendered and accepted in the Offer, the
Merger Consideration and all other amounts to be paid pursuant to this
Agreement and the payment of all associated costs and expenses of the Offer
and the Merger to be paid on the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.08 _Solvency_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is entering into this
Agreement with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or
future creditors. Immediately after giving effect to all of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including the Debt Financing), the payment of
the aggregate Merger Consideration and any other repayment or refinancing
of debt that may be contemplated, and payment of all related fees and
expenses, assuming (w) the accuracy of the Companys representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, (x) the satisfaction of the conditions
to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Offer and the
Merger, (y) the performance by the Company of its obligations hereunder in all
material respects, and (z) the most recent financial forecasts of the
Company made available to Parent prior to the date hereof have been prepared
in good faith based on assumptions that were and continue to be reasonable,
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will be Solvent on the Closing
Date. For purposes of this  _Section 5.08_, the term " _Solvent_ " with
respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, means that, as of
any date of determination, (a) the amount of the fair saleable value of the
assets of Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, exceeds, as of such
date, the amount that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on its existing debts
(including a reasonable estimate of contingent liabilities), (b) Parent and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the business in
which it is engaged on such date, and (c) Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, will be able to pay its liabilities as they mature.

Section 5.09 _Brokers_. The Company will not be responsible for any
brokerage, finders, financial advisors or other fee or commission payable to
any broker, finder or investment banker in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by and on behalf
of Parent and Merger Sub.

 



36 Section 5.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, neither Parent
nor any other Person on behalf of Parent makes any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or with respect to any other information provided to the Company in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.11 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_. Parent and
Merger Sub each acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations
and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement (a) the Company is not
making and has not made any representations or warranties relating to itself
or its business or otherwise in connection with the Merger and Parent and
Merger Sub are not relying on any representation or warranty of the Company
except for those expressly set forth in this Agreement, (b) no Person
has been authorized by the Company to make any representation or warranty
relating to the Company or its business, and if made, such representation or
warranty must not be relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub as having been
authorized by the Company, and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions,
data, financial information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials
or information provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or include
representations or warranties unless any such materials or information are the
subject of any express representation or warranty set forth in this Agreement.

the Company or its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore furnished by

its representatives in accordance with the terms of such confidentiality

Parents prior written consent, any standstill or similar provision in any

 



40  confidentiality, standstill or other agreement with such Person; _provided_

necessary to permit a Person or group to make, on a confidential basis to the
Company Board, a Takeover Proposal, conditioned upon such Person agreeing to
disclosure of such Takeover Proposal to Parent, in each case as contemplated
by this S _ection 6.02_ ( _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company may only
take such action if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure of the Company
Board to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law). The Company shall
not enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof
which prohibits the Company from providing to Parent the information required
to be provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.02_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company and its
Representatives may in any event (A) seek to clarify and understand the terms
and conditions of any inquiry or proposal made by such Person or group solely
to determine whether such inquiry or proposal constitutes or could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and (B) inform a Person or group
that has made or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is considering making a
Takeover Proposal of the provisions of this _Section 6.02_.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company has received a
_bona fide_ , written Takeover Proposal from any Person or group that did not
result from a material breach of this _Section 6.02_, and (ii) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and that the failure
to take such action described in _clause (A)_ or  _(B)_ below would be
reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, then the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to
the Company to the Person or group making such Takeover Proposal pursuant to
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ _,_ that (x) the Company
shall substantially concurrently provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company that is provided to (or given access to) any Person or
group and which was not previously provided to Parent and (y) the Company
shall take reasonable steps to safeguard any commercially sensitive non-public
information of the Company, in a manner reasonably consistent with
the Companys past practices in dealing with the disclosure of such
information in the context of considering Takeover Proposals, or (B) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Takeover Proposal
regarding such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to or
concurrently with the Company taking such actions as described in _clauses
(A)_ and/or _(B)_ above, the Company shall provide written notice to Parent
of such determination of the Company Board as provided for in _clause (ii)_
above, together with the identity of the Person or group making such Takeover
Proposal.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify Parent orally and in writing in the event that the Company, its
directors, officers or employees or, to the Companys Knowledge, any of its
other Representatives, receives any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to any Takeover Proposal,
or any initial request for non-public information concerning the Company from
any Person or group who has made or would reasonably be expected to make any
Takeover Proposal, or any initial request for discussions or negotiations
related to any Takeover Proposal,

 



41  and, in connection with such notice, provide the material terms and
conditions thereof and the nature of such request, and thereafter the Company
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of the
status and material details of discussions with respect thereto, including any
material changes to the terms thereof. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four
(24) hours) provide Parent with copies of all written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed agreements, and oral summaries of any oral
requests, proposals or offers, received by the Company or that the Company
delivers to any Person or group making an Alternative Proposal.

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw
or rescind (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger
Sub), or publicly propose to withdraw or rescind (or modify or qualify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), the Company Board Recommendation or
the findings or conclusions of the Company Board referred to in Section
4.03(b), (ii) approve or recommend the adoption of, or publicly propose to
approve, declare the advisability of or recommend the adoption of, any
Takeover Proposal, (iii) cause or permit the Company to execute or enter
into, any Acquisition Agreement, (iv) publicly propose or announce an
intention to take any of the foregoing actions, (v) following the date any
Takeover Proposal or any material modification thereto is first made public
or sent or given to the stockholders of the Company, fail to issue a press
release stating that the Company Board Recommendation has not changed within
three (3) Business Days following Parents written request to do so (which
request may only be made once with respect to any such Takeover Proposal and
each material modification thereto), or (vi) fail to include the Company Board
Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 when disseminated to the Companys
stockholders (any action described in _clause (i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_
, _(v)_ or _(vi)_ being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_
").

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may, subject to compliance
with the other provisions of this _Section 6.02_, (1) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Proposal or (2) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event (as defined
below); _provided_ , that (w) the Company Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (x) in the case of clause (1), the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors) that the applicable Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and that it intends to accept or recommend
such Superior Proposal, (y) the Company shall have provided prior written
notice to Parent, at least three (3) Business Days prior to taking the
applicable action referred to in _clause (1)_ or _(2)_ of its intent to
take such action and specifying the reasons therefor (a " _Notice of Intended
Recommendation Change_ "), and (z) the Company has complied with the following
additional covenants: 

(i) if such Adverse Recommendation Change is being made pursuant to _clause
(1)_ above, and if desired by Parent, after providing any such Notice of
Intended Recommendation Change, the Company shall, and shall cause its
directors, officers and employees to and shall direct and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its other Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in
good faith during any such three (3) Business Day period regarding any
proposal by Parent to amend the terms and conditions of this

 



42  Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby and at the end of
such three (3) Business Day period (as it may be extended pursuant to the
following proviso) the Company Board again makes the determinations described
in _clauses (w)_ and _(x)_ with respect to such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ that in the event that there is any material amendment to the terms
of any such Superior Proposal (including any revision in the amount, form or
mix of consideration the Companys stockholders would receive as a result of
the Superior Proposal), the Company shall notify Parent of such material
revision in compliance with _Section 6.02(c)_ and the period during which
the Company shall, and shall cause its directors, officers and employees to
and shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent shall be
extended until at least two (2) Business Days after the time the Company
provides such notification to Parent of any such material revision and the
Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change prior to the end
of any such period as so extended; and

(ii) if such Adverse Recommendation Change is being made pursuant to _clause
(2)_ above:

 

(1) such Adverse Recommendation Change is being made as a result of an event,
fact, development or occurrence that materially affects the business, assets
or operations of the Company (other than any event or circumstance resulting
from a material breach of this Agreement by the Company) that was not known to
the Company Board as of the date hereof and becomes known to the Company
Board after the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time (an "
_Intervening Event_ "); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the receipt, existence
or terms of a Takeover Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence
thereof shall not constitute an Intervening Event; and

(2) during any such three (3) Business Day period, if desired by Parent, the
Company shall, and shall cause its directors, officers and employees to and
shall direct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Representatives to, negotiate with Parent in good faith during any such
three (3) Business Day period regarding any proposal by Parent to amend the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated
hereby and at the end of such three (3) Business Day period the Company Board
again makes the determinations described in _clause (w)_ with respect to
such Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this  _Section 6.02_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position with respect to a tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules
14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the judgment of
the Company Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel) failure to
do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the exercise of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or otherwise violate its obligations
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Adverse Recommendation
Change may be made unless the Company shall have first complied with its
obligations in _Section 6.02(e)_.

 



43 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Takeover Proposal_ " means
any proposal or offer from any Person or group providing for (A) any direct
or indirect acquisition, purchase or license, in a single transaction or a
series of related transactions, of (1) 20% or more of the assets (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, Intellectual Property) of the Company, or (2)
Shares or any other Company Securities, which together with any other Shares
or other Company Securities beneficially owned by such Person or group, would
represent 20% or more of the outstanding Shares, (B) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group
owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the outstanding Shares, (C) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange or similar
transaction involving the Company pursuant to which any Person or group (or
the shareholders of any Person) would own, directly or indirectly, 20% or more
of the aggregate voting power of the Company or of the surviving entity in a
merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such
surviving entity or 20% or more of the assets (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, Intellectual Property) of the Company, or (D) any reorganization,
recapitalization, extraordinary dividend, liquidation, dissolution or any
other similar transaction involving the Company, other than, in each case, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ "
means any _bona fide_ , written Takeover Proposal received after the date
hereof that if consummated would result in a Person or group owning, directly
or indirectly, (A) more than 50% of the outstanding Shares or (B) more than
50% of the assets of the Company, taken as a whole, in either case which the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) (x) is reasonably likely to be consummated
in accordance with its terms, and (y) if consummated, would be more favorable
to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the
Offer and the Merger, in each case taking into account the
consideration, terms, conditions, timing, financing terms and all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such Takeover Proposal (including the
Person or group making the Takeover Proposal) and of this Agreement (including
any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent pursuant to
_Section 6.02(e))_.

Section 6.03 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement, subject to the requirements of
applicable Law, the Company will (i) give Parent and Merger Sub and their
authorized officers, employees, accountants, investment bankers, counsel and
other representatives reasonable access (during regular business hours upon
reasonable notice) to such employees, plants, offices, warehouses and
other facilities at reasonable times and to such books, contracts,
commitments and records (including Tax Returns) of the Company as Parent may
reasonably request and instruct the Companys independent public accountants
to provide access to their work papers and such other information as Parent
or Merger Sub may reasonably request, (ii) permit Parent and Merger Sub to
make such inspections as they may reasonably require, (iii) furnish Parent and
Merger Sub with such financial and operating data and other information with
respect to the business, properties and personnel of the Company as Parent or
Merger Sub may from time to time reasonably request, (iv) furnish promptly to
Parent and Merger Sub a copy of each report, schedule and other document
filed or received by the Company during such period pursuant to the
requirements of the federal or state securities Laws, and (v) use its
reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining reasonable
physical access to the Manufacturing Facility in order for Parent to make
such inspections as it may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company shall not be obligated to provide such access, inspections, data
or other information 

 



44  to the extent that to do so (A) could reasonably be expected to jeopardize
an attorney-client privilege or attorney work product protection, or (B) would
violate an existing confidentiality obligation to any Person; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of _clause (A)_ and _(B)_ , the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any required consents to
provide such access, inspections, data or other information and take such
other action (such as the redaction of identifying or confidential
information, entry into a joint defense agreement or other agreement or by
providing such access, inspections, data or other information solely to
outside counsel to avoid the loss of attorney client privilege) as is
necessary to provide such access, inspections, data or other information to
Parent and Merger Sub in compliance with applicable Law, and otherwise
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to institute appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances.

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, and provided that
the Company will have final authority over the form and content of all
submissions to and communications with the FDA, the Company shall, subject to
its compliance with any confidentiality obligations to third parties, (i)
promptly notify Parent in writing of any significant data relating to the
safety or effectiveness of the Companys product OFIRMEV® (acetaminophen)
injection (the " _Key Product_ "), including any information that could lead
to a recall of or material labeling change to the Key Product in the United
States, (ii) reasonably consult with Parent in connection with any proposed
meeting with the FDA relating to the Key Product, (iii) promptly inform Parent
of, and provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review, any material
filing, correspondence, or communication proposed to be submitted to the FDA
relating to the Key Product, (iv) promptly inform Parent of any material oral
or written communication from or to the FDA relating to the Key Product, and
(v) promptly inform Parent of, and provide Parent with a reasonable
opportunity to comment on, any material change to the Key Product that would
affect its regulatory approval status, including material changes to the
manufacturing plan or process and marketing of the Key Product.

(c) All information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this
_Section 6.03_ shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Section 6.04  _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms
and subject to the conditions hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, (i)
each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall file within five (5) Business
Days any required submissions under the HSR Act, and use its reasonable best
efforts (A) to furnish information required in connection with such
submissions under the HSR Act (including responding to any "second request"
for additional information or documentary material under the HSR Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable), (B) to obtain early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act, (C) to keep the other parties reasonably
informed with respect to the status of any such submissions under the HSR Act,
including with respect to: (1) the receipt of any non-action, action,
clearance, consent, approval or waiver, (2) the expiration of any waiting
period, (3) the commencement or proposed or threatened commencement of any
investigation, litigation or administrative or judicial action or proceeding
under the HSR Act, the Federal Trade

 



45  Commission Act, as amended (the " _FTC Act_ "), the Clayton Act of 1914, as
amended (the " _Clayton Act_ "), or the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as
amended (the " _Sherman Act_ ") and (4) the nature and status of any
objections raised or proposed or threatened to be raised under the HSR Act,
the FTC Act, the Clayton Act or the Sherman Act with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
hereby and (D) to obtain all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers,
consents, clearances and approvals from any Governmental Entity and (ii) the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with one another: (A) in
promptly determining whether any filings are required to be or should be made
or any consents, approvals or waivers are required to be or should be obtained
from other parties to loan agreements or other Contracts or instruments that
the Company is a party to or related to the Companys business in connection
with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby and (B) in promptly making any such filings, furnishing
information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain timely any
such consents, permits, approvals or waivers.

 

(b) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall: (i) promptly notify the others
of, and if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of
oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any communication
to such Person from a Governmental Entity and permit the others to review and
discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by
the others in relation to) any proposed written communication to a
Governmental Entity and (ii) keep the others reasonably informed of any
developments, requests for meetings or discussions with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry concerning the
Offer or the Merger. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree not to
participate in any meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone,
with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed transaction
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by Law, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate where appropriate and advisable under
the circumstances. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of _Section
1.01(d)_ and _Section 1.02(a)_, not this _Section 6.04(b)_, shall govern the
matters covered therein.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
hereby agree and acknowledge that nothing in this Agreement shall require, or
be construed to require, Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of Parents
Subsidiaries, in order to obtain any required approval from any Governmental
Entity or any third party, to: (i) sell, lease, license, transfer, dispose
of, divest or otherwise encumber, or hold separate pending any such action, or
(ii) propose, negotiate or offer to effect, or consent or commit to, any such
sale, leasing, licensing, transfer, disposal, or divestiture, or
holding separate, before or after the Acceptance Time or the Effective Time,
of any assets, licenses, operations, rights, product lines, businesses or
interests therein of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
Parents Subsidiaries;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub
shall be required to agree or consent to conduct of business restrictions with
respect to their operations or businesses as may be required in order to
obtain any required approval from any Governmental Entity or any third party,
only to the extent that such conduct of business restrictions would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have an adverse
effect on the business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets or results
of operations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the Company, which, if
measured relative to Parents active pharmaceutical ingredients business,
would constitute a material adverse effect on such business, regardless
of whether such restrictions would be imposed on Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or the Company.

 



46 (d) In the event that any litigation or other administrative or judicial
action is commenced challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby
and such litigation, action or proceeding seeks to prevent, impede or delay
the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall cooperate with each other and use its respective reasonable best efforts
to contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order that may result from such litigation, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
unless, by mutual agreement, Parent and the Company decide that litigation is
not in their respective best interests. Each party hereto shall keep the other
parties hereto reasonably informed, but only to the extent that doing so would
not, in the reasonable judgment of such party, jeopardize any privilege of
the party with respect thereto regarding any such litigation, action or
proceeding, it being agreed that each party will also cooperate with the other
parties to permit such inspection of or to disclose such information on a
basis that does not compromise or waive such privilege with respect thereto.
The Company shall cooperate fully with Parent (and shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause its representatives to cooperate fully with Parent) in
connection with, and shall consult with and permit Parent and its
representatives to participate in, the defense of any such litigation, action
or proceeding and the Company shall give due consideration to Parents advice
with respect to such litigation, action or proceeding; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Company shall not be allowed to settle or enter into any
negotiations or settlement of any such litigation, action or proceeding
without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

(e) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall Parent permit its
Subsidiaries to, acquire or agree to acquire any business, Person or division
thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets (except in each
case pursuant to any agreement in effect on the date hereof), if the entering
into of a definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such
acquisition, would reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of
not obtaining the applicable consent, clearance, approval, authorization or
waiver under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and
use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do
or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on
its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the NASDAQ
Global Market to cause the delisting of the Shares from the NASDAQ Global
Market by the Surviving Corporation as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act as
promptly as practicable after such delisting.

 



47 Section 6.05 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or
former directors and officers of the Company (each an " _Indemnified Person_
") as provided in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or
under any agreement filed as an exhibit to the Filed SEC Documents filed
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date hereof or listed on _Section
4.16_ of the Disclosure Letter, in each case as in effect as of the date
hereof with respect to matters occurring prior to or at the Effective Time
shall survive the Offer Closing and the Merger and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will cause
to be maintained in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective
Time, policies of directors and officers liability insurance (which may
take the form of an extended reporting period, endorsement or policy) covering
the Persons currently covered by the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance policies in an amount and scope at least as
favorable as the Companys policies existing on the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be
required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such insurance policies in
excess of 300% of the annual premium paid by the Company for coverage for its
last full fiscal year for such insurance (which amount is set forth in
_Section 6.05(b)_ of the Disclosure Letter); _provided_ , _further_ , that
if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, if and
to the extent available commercially, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Parent or the Surviving Corporation may purchase, in lieu
of the insurance contemplated by the preceding sentence, a six-year "tail"
prepaid policy on the directors and officers liability insurance policies on
terms and conditions no less favorable than the directors and officers
liability insurance policies in effect on the date hereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the maximum aggregate annual premium for such insurance
policies for any such year shall not be in excess of the maximum aggregate
annual premium contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence. 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified Person
notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time that a Legal Proceeding (whether arising before, at or
after the Effective Time) has been commenced against such Indemnified Person
in respect of which such Person expects to seek indemnification pursuant
to this _Section 6.05_, the provisions of this _Section 6.05_ shall
continue in effect with respect to such Legal Proceeding until the final
disposition of such Legal Proceeding.

 

(d) This _Section 6.05_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Persons and
their respective heirs and legal representatives.

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.05_.

 



48 Section 6.06 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to assume, honor and
fulfill all of the Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement or as subsequently amended in
accordance with this Agreement.

(b) Parent hereby agrees that, for a period of at least twelve (12) months
following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of termination of the
applicable Continuing Employee), it shall, or it shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, (i) provide each employee of the Company who continues as of
the Effective Time to be employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of Parent (each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") with at least the
same level of base salary or hourly wage rate, as the case may be, and
incentive compensation targets (excluding equity compensation) that were
provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and (ii) provide the Continuing Employee with other compensation and employee
benefits (excluding equity compensation) that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than those provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time.

 

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting, and benefit accrual (solely for the
purposes of determining accrual of vacation and paid time off) under the
employee benefit plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation providing benefits to any Continuing
Employee following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Parent
Benefit Plans_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, cause service rendered by each Continuing Employee to the Company prior to
the Effective Time to be credited for all purposes (other than for purposes of
determining an accrued benefit under any defined benefit pension plan) to the
same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, prior to the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Plan; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event shall Continuing Employees be entitled to
service credit to the extent such service credit would result in a duplication
of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(d) In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i)
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time,
in any and all Parent Benefit Plans to the extent coverage under such Parent
Benefit Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately before the Effective Time; and
(ii) for purposes of each Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee from and
after the Effective Time, (A) Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause all pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting
periods and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Benefit Plan to be
waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to the
extent such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, waiting periods or
actively-at-work requirements were waived or satisfied under the comparable
Plan and (B) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize,
or cause to be recognized, any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents under a Plan during the portion of
the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken into account under such
Parent Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, co-insurance,
co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Parent Benefit
Plan.

 



49 (e) Within ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver or make available to Parent the documents or
information listed on _Section 6.06(e)_ of the Disclosure Letter.

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this _Section 6.06_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto,
and that nothing in this _Section 6.06_, whether express or implied, (i)
shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (A) in any other
Person, including any employees or former employees of the Company or any
Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (B) to continued employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation), (ii) shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any Plan or Parent Benefit Plan, or (iii) shall limit the right of Parent or
its Subsidiaries (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Plan or Parent
Benefit Plan.

 

Section 6.07 _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, the Support Agreement, the
Offer or the Merger, including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then the Company and the
Company Board, as applicable, shall take all action necessary to ensure that
the Offer, the Merger, the Support Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of such
Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, the Support Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated hereby. No Adverse Recommendation
Change shall change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing
any Takeover Law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 6.08 _Security Holder Litigation_. In the event that any
litigation related to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby is brought by any stockholder or other holder
of any Company Securities (whether directly or on behalf of the Company or
otherwise) against the Company and/or its directors or officers, the Company
shall promptly notify Parent of such litigation and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense of any such litigation,
and the Company shall give due consideration to Parents advice with respect
to such litigation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the Company shall not settle or enter into any negotiations or settlement of
any such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

 

Section 6.09 _Press Releases_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable U.S. or
non-U.S. securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the
relevant party is subject or submits, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow
each other party reasonable time to comment on such

 



50  release or announcement in advance of such issuance, it being understood
that the final form and content of any such release or announcement, to the
extent so required, shall be at the final discretion of the disclosing party.
The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (a) to the extent the content
of any press release or other announcement has been made in accordance with
this _Section 6.09_, no separate approval shall be required in respect of
such content to the extent replicated in whole or in part in any subsequent
press release or other announcement, and (b) each party may, without complying
with the foregoing obligations, make any public statement regarding
the transactions contemplated hereby in response to questions from the press,
analysts, investors or those attending industry conferences, make internal
announcements to employees, to the extent that such statements are not
inconsistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made jointly by the parties and otherwise in compliance with this
_Section 6.09_ and do not reveal material nonpublic information regarding
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.09_ shall not apply
to any release or announcement made or proposed to be made by the Company in
connection with and related to an Adverse Recommendation Change, so long as
any public statement in connection with an Adverse Recommendation Change is
made in compliance with _Section 6.02_.

 

Section 6.10 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all reasonable steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of Company
equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 6.11 _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall not, from and after the date hereof and until the
Effective Time, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any current or
former director, manager, officer, employee or independent contractor of the
Company, unless prior to such entry into, establishment, amendment or
modification, the compensation committee of the Company Board (each member of
which the Company Board determined is an "independent director" within the
meaning of the applicable NASDAQ rules and shall be an "independent director"
in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange
Act at the time of any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may
reasonably be necessary to (a) approve as an Employment Compensation
Arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (b) satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or
arrangement; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 6.11_ shall be
construed to permit the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

Section 6.12 _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall deliver to Parent, at
the earlier of the Acceptance Time and the Closing Date, a properly completed
and executed certificate to the effect that the Shares are not a U.S. real
property interest (such certificate to be in the form required by Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3)).

 



51 Section 6.13 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Debt Financing and obtain the proceeds
of the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment
Letter and Fee Letter, including using reasonable best efforts to (i)
maintain in effect and enforce the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter in
accordance with their terms, (ii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the " _Definitive Agreements_
") consistent with the terms and conditions contained therein (including, as
necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter), (iii) satisfy
(or, if deemed advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis
all conditions in the Commitment Letter, Fee Letter and the Definitive
Agreements and comply with its obligations thereunder, and (iv) draw a
sufficient amount of the Debt Financing to enable Parent to consummate the
Offer and the Merger, in the event that all closing conditions contained in
_Section 7.01_ and _Annex I_ shall be satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, _provided_
that such conditions are capable of being satisfied as of such day assuming
the Closing was to occur on such day). Parent shall provide the Company with
prompt notice of any material breach or repudiation by any party to the
Commitment Letter or Fee Letter of which the Parent becomes aware. In the
event that all conditions contained in the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter
have been satisfied and Parent and Merger Sub are required to consummate the
Closing pursuant to _Section 2.02_, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause each Lender to fund its respective committed portion of the Debt
Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date. Parent
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, permit any
amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision (including any
remedy) under, or voluntarily replace (it being understood that any
Alternative Debt Financing shall not be deemed a voluntary replacement for
purposes of this sentence), the Commitment Letter or Fee Letter if such
amendment, modification, or waiver or voluntary replacement (w) adds new (or
adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation of the
Debt Financing as compared to those in the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter
as in effect on the date hereof, (x) adversely affects the ability of Parent
to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment Letter, Fee
Letter or the Definitive Agreements as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against such other parties to the Commitment Letter and Fee Letter as in
effect on the date hereof or in the Definitive Agreements, (y) reduces the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing, or (z) would otherwise reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that for the
avoidance of doubt no consent from the Company shall be required for: (A) any
amendment, replacement, supplement or modification of the Commitment Letter
that is limited to adding lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of
the date hereof (including in replacement of a Lender), (B) implementation or
exercise of any "flex" provisions provided in the Fee Letter as in effect as
of the date hereof, or (C) any amendment, replacement, supplement or
modification to the Commitment Letter or Definitive Agreements so long as such
action would not be prohibited by the foregoing _clauses_   _(w)_ through
_(z)_. Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such
amendment, modification or replacement of the Commitment Letter or the Fee
Letter.

 



52 (b) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to
satisfy its obligations under this _Section 6.13_, the Commitment Letter or
Fee Letter (or any Definitive Agreements relating thereto) expires or is
terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason,
including as a result of a breach or repudiation or if any portion of the
Debt Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason
therefor (other than a breach by the Company of this Agreement which prevents
or renders impracticable the consummation of the Debt Financing) Parent will
(1) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain alternative debt financing (the
" _Alternative Debt Financing_ ") (in an amount sufficient, when taken
together with available cash on hand, and any then-available Debt Financing
pursuant to any then-existing Commitment Letter, to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to pay related fees and
expenses earned, due and payable as of the Closing Date) on terms not
less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than those contained in the
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter that the alternative financing would
replace (taking into account any flex provisions) from the same or other
sources and which do not include any incremental conditionality to the
consummation of such alternative debt financing that are more onerous to
Parent or the Company (in the aggregate) than the conditions set forth in the
Commitment Letter in effect as of the date hereof and (2) promptly notify the
Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor.

(c) For purposes of the foregoing  _Section 6.13(a)_ and _Section 6.13(b)_,
(i) the term "Commitment Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment
letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative debt financing
arranged in compliance herewith (and any Commitment Letters remaining in
effect at the time in question), (ii) the term "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to
include any fee letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative
debt financing arranged in compliance with this Section 6.13, and (iii) the
term "Lenders" shall be deemed to include any lenders providing the
alternative debt financing arranged in compliance herewith.

 

Section 6.14 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its officers, employees, consultants and advisors,
including legal and accounting advisors, to, provide to Parent such
cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with
obtaining the Debt Financing, including, (i) making senior management and
advisors of the Company available to participate in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, and due diligence sessions with proposed lenders or
placement agents, and in sessions with rating agencies, in each case at such
times as coordinated reasonably in advance thereof, (ii) assisting Parent
with Parents preparation of pro forma financial information and pro forma
financial statements and other materials for rating agency presentations, bank
information memoranda, financial projections and similar documents used in
connection with the Debt Financing and providing customary estimates and other
forward-looking financial information regarding the future performance of the
business of the Company to the extent reasonably requested by the Debt
Financing sources, and providing customary authorization and representation
letters in connection therewith, (iii) executing and delivering definitive
financing documents, including pledge and security documents, and
certificates, management representation letters and other documents, to the
extent reasonably requested by Parent, and otherwise reasonably facilitating
the pledging of collateral (provided that, in each case, to the extent
provided in clause (iii) of the first sentence of _Section 6.14(b)_, such
documents shall be

 



53  subject to the Closing and shall only be effective at or after the Effective
Time), (iv) requesting and cooperating in obtaining customary lien
terminations and instruments of discharge (the effectiveness of which shall
be subject to the Closing and the occurrence of the Effective Time), relating
to any indebtedness of the Company (it being understood and agreed that the
Companys obligations to provide payoff letters in respect of the Existing
Loan Agreement are as set forth in _Section 6.14(c)_ below), (v) providing
reasonable access by Parent and any Debt Financing sources, and their
respective officers, employees, consultants and advisors (including
legal, valuation, and accounting advisors) to the books and records,
properties, officers, directors, agents and representatives of the Company,
(vi) assisting with due diligence activities relating to the Companys
financial and other information during normal business hours upon reasonable
advance notice, (vii) furnishing to Parent and its Debt Financing sources all
pertinent and customary financial and other information regarding the Company
reasonably requested by Parent as promptly as practicable following such
request (it being agreed that the fiscal year 2013 audited financial
statements described in the immediately following clause (1) shall be
furnished as soon as they become available and in any event no later than 75
days after December 31, 2013), including (1) the Companys fiscal year 2013,
2012 and 2011 audited financial statements and (2) the Company unaudited
consolidated balance sheets and related statements of income and cash flows
for each fiscal quarter ended after the close of its fiscal year 2013 and at
least 40 days prior to the Closing Date (viii) taking all actions reasonably
requested to (A) permit the prospective lenders and placement agents involved
in the Debt Financing to evaluate the Companys assets, business, cash
management and accounting systems, policies and procedures relating thereto,
including inventory appraisals and field audits, for the purpose of
establishing collateral arrangements and (B) establish bank and other
accounts and blocked account contracts and lock box arrangements in connection
with the foregoing after the Acceptance Time, (ix) providing at least four (4)
Business Days prior to the Acceptance Time all documentation and other
information about the Company required by applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations including the USA Patriot Act to
the extent requested at least eight (8) calendar days prior to the
anticipated Acceptance Time and (x) subject to the occurrence of the
Acceptance Time, taking all corporate actions necessary to permit consummation
of the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that nothing herein shall require (1)
such cooperation to the extent it would interfere materially and unreasonably
with the business or operations of the Company, (2) delivery of (A) any other
financial information in a form not customarily prepared by the Company or
(B) any financial information with respect to a fiscal period that has not yet
ended, or (C) any financial statement with respect to any fiscal quarter
(other than the fourth quarter) prior to the date that is 40 days after the
end of the applicable fiscal quarter, unless, except in the case of clauses
(A) and (C), such information is earlier reasonably available to the Company
and reasonably requested by Parent, or (3) the taking of any action that
would conflict with or violate (x) the Company Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws, in each case that are not contingent upon the earlier of the
Acceptance Time and the Effective Time or (y) any applicable Laws. The
Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in connection with the Debt
Financing; _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its logos and on such other
customary terms and conditions as the Company shall reasonably impose, and
Parent and its representatives shall cease all such use on the date of
termination of this Agreement in the event that this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with _Section 8.01_.

 



54 (b) Nothing in this _Section 6.14_ shall require the Company to (i) bear
any out-of-pocket cost or expense that is not reimbursed pursuant to this
_Section 6.14(b)_ or pay any fee in connection with the Debt Financing, (ii)
incur any liability (or cause their respective directors, officers or
employees to incur any liability) under the Debt Financing prior to the
Effective Time or (iii) enter into any definitive agreement or commitment that
would be effective prior to the Effective Time (other than such management
representation letters and authorization letters with respect to information
memoranda, authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders
and placement agents and containing customary representations that such
information does not contain a material misstatement or omission, and that
the public-side versions of such documents, if any, do not include material
non-public information with respect to the Company or its securities for
purposes of federal securities laws). Furthermore, Parent shall, promptly
upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company and its
representatives in connection with their respective obligations pursuant to
this  _Section 6.14_. Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
its Affiliates and its representatives (collectively, the " _Financing
Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs
or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the Debt
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than any
information provided in writing specifically for use by or on behalf of the
Company), in each case other than to the extent any of the foregoing arises
from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or breach of
this Agreement by a Financing Indemnitee (the obligations in this sentence,
the " _Financing Cooperation Indemnity_ "). The obligations of Parent in the
foregoing sentence shall survive the consummation of the Merger and any
termination of this Agreement. After the Effective Time, the Financing
Cooperation Indemnity only may be amended or waived in respect of any
Financing Indemnitee with the consent of such Financing Indemnitee.

(c) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent and
Merger Sub at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Acceptance Time, but
in no event later than two (2) Business Days before the Acceptance Time, a
payoff letter with respect to the Second Amended and Restated Loan and
Security Agreement dated December 22, 2011 by and among the Company and Oxford
Finance LLC, Silicon Valley Bank and General Electric Capital Corporation (as
amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, the "
_Existing Loan Agreement_ "), which payoff letter shall substantially provide
(subject to customary exceptions) (x) that upon receipt of the payoff amount
set forth in the payoff letter at or prior to the Effective Time,
the respective indebtedness incurred thereunder and related instruments shall
be terminated and (y) that all Liens (and guarantees), if any, in connection
therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties of the Company
securing such Indebtedness, shall be, upon the payment of the amount set
forth in the payoff letter at or prior to the Effective Time (and, if
applicable, providing for letters of credit or cash collateral) be released
and terminated. At or prior to the Effective Time (but subject to the
Effective Time occurring), the Company shall pay off all amounts outstanding
(including related fees and expenses) under the Existing Loan Agreement (up to
the extent of cash available to the Company at such time).

 



55 Section 6.15 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of (i) any
written notice or other communication received by such party from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the Offer or the Merger, if the failure to obtain such consent would
reasonably be expected to materially affect the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger and (ii) any Legal Proceedings commenced or, to such partys
Knowledge, threatened against, the Company or Parent or any of Parents
Subsidiaries, that purport to materially impede or delay the consummation of
the Offer or the Merger, or that make allegations that, if true, would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of (i) any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of the Company contained herein in any material
respect at any time during the term hereof and (ii) any failure of the Company
to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in each case if and only to
the extent that such inaccuracy, or such failure, would reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby set forth in _paragraph
(c)(iii)_ or  _paragraph (c)(iv)_ of _Annex I_ to fail to be satisfied at the
then scheduled expiration of the Offer. For the avoidance of doubt, the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.15(b)_ shall not affect or
be deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth
in this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and
Acquisition Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the remedies available to the parties hereunder.

(c) Parent shall promptly notify the Company of (i) any inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained herein in any
material respect at any time during the term hereof and (ii) any failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, in
each case if and only to the extent that such inaccuracy, or such failure,
would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger) or the ability of Parent and
Merger Sub to fully perform their respective covenants and obligations under
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this  _Section 6.15(c)_ shall not affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the remedies available to
the parties hereunder.

ARTICLE VII.

ARTICLE VIII.

 

TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

 

Section 8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and
the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time (with
any termination by Parent also being an effective termination by Merger Sub):

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if prior to the Acceptance Time any court
of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued an
order, injunction or decree, or taken any other action, in each case the
effect of which is to make illegal or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
Offer or the Merger and such order, injunction, decree or other action shall
have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , that the party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall have
complied with its obligations under _Section 6.04_ to contest, appeal and
remove such order, injunction, decree or action; _provided further_ ,
_however_ , that the right to terminate under this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall
not be available to any party whose failure to perform in any material
respect any covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement
has primarily caused such order, injunction, decree or action.

 

(c) by either the Company or Parent, if the Acceptance Time shall not have
occurred on or before June 10, 2014 (such date, as it may be extended
pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)_, the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the right to terminate under this _Section 8.01(c)_
shall not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill in any material
respect any covenants and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement
has resulted in the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur on or before the
Outside Date, _provided_ , _further_ , however, that in the event that the
Acceptance Time would have occurred by the Outside Date but for the failure to
satisfy the Offer Condition set forth in item (b) of _Annex I_ as of such
time, then (A) the Company or Parent may extend the Outside Date to a date no
later than August 10, 2014, and (B) the Company and Parent may, by mutual
agreement, further extend the Outside Date to a date no later than September
10, 2014; _provided_ that both parties agree to act reasonably in making such
mutual determination to extend, provided it is reasonably likely that the
Offer Condition set forth in item (b) of Annex I will be satisfied by
September 10, 2014;

 

(d) by Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if there shall be any
breach of or inaccuracy in any of the Companys representations or warranties
set forth herein or the Company has failed to perform any of its covenants or
agreements set forth herein, which inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform
(i) would give rise to the failure of any Offer Condition set forth in
_clauses (iii)_ or _(iv)_ of _paragraph (c)_ of _Annex I_ , and (ii) (A) is
not capable of being cured prior to the Outside Date or (B) is not cured
within twenty (20) Business Days following

 



57  Parents delivery of written notice to the Company of such breach or failure
to perform; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 8.01(d)_ if Parent or Merger Sub is
then in material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements hereunder such that the Company has the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 8.01(e)_;

(e) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if there shall
be any breach or inaccuracy in any of Parents or Merger Subs
representations or warranties set forth herein or Parent or Merger Sub has
failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements set forth herein, which
inaccuracy, breach or failure to perform (i) would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the ability of
Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Offer and the Merger), and (ii) (A) is not capable
of being cured prior to the Outside Date or (B) is not cured within twenty
(20) Business Days following the Companys delivery of written notice to
Parent of such breach or failure to perform;  _provided_ that the Company
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.01(e)_ if the Company is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements hereunder such that
Parent has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.01(d)_;

(f) by Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, in the event that
any of the following shall have occurred: (i) an Adverse Recommendation
Change; (ii) a tender or exchange offer relating to securities of the Company
shall have been commenced and the Company shall not have publicly announced,
within five (5) Business Days after the commencement of such tender or
exchange offer, that the Company recommends rejection of such tender or
exchange offer; or (iii) a material breach of the provisions of  _Section
6.02_;

(g) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company
Board is permitted to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.02(e)_, in order to enter
into an Acquisition Agreement providing for such Superior Proposal immediately
following or concurrently with such termination; _provided_ _,_ _however_ ,
that concurrent payment of the Fee pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)_ shall be a
condition to the right of the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this  _Section 8.01(g)_; or

(h) by the Company, if Merger Sub shall have failed to commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer within the time
period specified in _Section 1.01(a)_.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _clause_ _(b)_ ,
_(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(e)_ , _(f)_ , _(g)_ or _(h)_ of this _Section 8.01_ shall
give written notice of such termination to the other party in accordance
with  _Section 9.05_, specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant
to which such termination is effected.

Section 8.02  _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and
the Offer and the Merger are abandoned pursuant to _Section 8.01_, this
Agreement, except for the provisions of the last sentence of _Section
1.02(b)_,  _Section 6.03(c)_, the Financing Cooperation Indemnity, this
_Section 8.02_, _Section 8.03_ and _Article IX_ (other than _Section
9.03_), shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability
on the part of any party or any of

 



58  its respective directors, officers, stockholders, employees, agents,
consultants or representatives or any lender or other provider of Debt
Financing to Parent. Nothing in this Agreement (including _Section 8.03(c)_)
shall relieve any party to this Agreement of liability for fraud or any
Willful Breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement prior to such termination. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Willful Breach_ " means an intentional and
willful material breach, or an intentional and willful material failure to
perform, in each case that is the consequence of an act or omission by a party
with the actual knowledge that the taking of such act or failure to take such
act would cause a breach of this Agreement.

Section 8.03  _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as otherwise specifically
provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses.

 

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent the Fee if this Agreement is terminated as
follows:

 

(i) if (i) after the date hereof, a Takeover Proposal shall have become
publicly known, (ii) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent
or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.01(c)_, or (B) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)_, and (iii) within nine (9) months of such termination, the
Company Board approves or recommends any Takeover Proposal (regardless of
when made), the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into any acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or other definitive agreement that provides for
any Takeover Proposal, or any Takeover Proposal is consummated, then, in any
such case, the Company shall pay to Parent (or a person designated by Parent
in writing) the Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2) Business
Days of the earliest of the date any such Company Board approval or
recommendation is made, any such acquisition agreement, merger agreement or
other definitive agreement is entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the date any such transaction is consummated. Solely
for purposes of this _Section 8.03(b)(i)_, the term " _Takeover Proposal_ "
shall have the meaning assigned to such term in _Section 6.02(g)_, except
that all references to "20%" therein shall be deemed to be references to
"50%";

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.01(f)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Fee by wire transfer of
same-day funds within one (1) Business Day following the date of such
termination of this Agreement; or

 

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
8.01(g)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent the Fee by wire transfer of
same-day funds prior to or simultaneously with (and as a condition to the
effectiveness of) such termination.

 

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and that, without these
agreements, the parties would not have

 



59  entered into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Fee shall be
payable only once and not in duplication even though the Fee may be payable
under one or more provisions hereof. Subject to _Section 8.02_, in the event
Parent shall receive the Fee, the receipt thereof shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (and the termination thereof or any matter
forming the basis for such termination), and neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other Legal
Proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of this
Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming
the basis for such termination. If the Company fails promptly to pay the Fee
when due and payable pursuant to this _Section 8.03_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences an action or other proceeding that
results in an award against the Company for such Fee, the Company shall pay
Parents costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such action or proceeding, together with interest
on the amount of the Fee from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

Section 8.04  _Amendment_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub, at any time
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that following the Offer Closing, this
Agreement may not be amended in any manner that causes the Merger
Consideration to differ from the Offer Price; _provided_ , _further_ , that
_Section 9.04(b)_ and _Section 9.04(c)_ may not be amended without the
consent of the Lenders and  _Section 8.02_ may not be amended in a manner
adverse to the Lenders without the consent of such Lenders. This Agreement may
not be amended, changed, supplemented or otherwise modified except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of all of the parties.

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver; Remedies_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, each party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein by any
other applicable party or in any document, certificate or writing delivered
pursuant hereto by any other applicable party or (c) waive compliance by any
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement
on the part of any party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only
if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

ARTICLE IX.

designations of approved financing sources in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement solely for purposes of permitting the Offer and the Merger and any
other action contemplated hereby. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any
party (including by operation of law, by merger or otherwise) without

relating to or in connection with this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving

shall be required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act, pay for any Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn, if:

(a) there shall not have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn that

outstanding (such condition in this _clause (a)_ , the " _Minimum Condition_

under the HSR Act shall not have been terminated or shall not have expired

Governmental Entity (other than the application of the waiting period

Offer or the Merger;

(ii) the Company and Parent shall have reached an agreement that the Offer or
the Agreement be terminated, or the Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms;

 

(iii) (A) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth

Action) or _Section 4.06(a)_ (Absence of Certain Changes) of the Agreement

set forth in _Section 4.02_ (Capitalization) of the Agreement shall not be
true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of the
Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),
except where the failure to be so true and correct has not resulted and would
not reasonably be expected to result in additional cost to the
Company, Parent and their Affiliates, individually or in the aggregate, of
more than $1.5 million, (C) any of the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in _Section 4.08_ (Brokers; Certain Expenses), _Section

and correct in all material respects as of the date of the Agreement and as of
the Expiration Date as though made on and as of such date (except to the
extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier
date) or (D) any representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
the Agreement (other than those listed in the preceding _clauses (c)(iii)(A)_
, _(c)(iii)(B)_ and _(c)(iii)(C)_ ) shall not be true and correct (without
giving effect to any limitation on any representation or warranty indicated by
the words "Material Adverse Effect," "in all material respects," "in any
material respect," "material," "materially" or words of similar import set
forth therein) as of the date of the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date
as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent expressly made as
of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date), except, in the
case of this _clause (c)(iii)(D)_ , where the failure of any such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct has not had and
would not be reasonably expected to result in, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

 

(iv) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply with in any material
respect any obligation, agreement or covenant required to be performed or
complied with by it under the Agreement on or prior to the Expiration Date;

(v) since the date of the Agreement, there shall have occurred any change,
state of facts, condition, event, circumstance, effect, occurrence or
development that has had or would reasonably be expected to result in,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect;

(vi) the Company shall not have furnished to Parent (i) audited consolidated

pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The foregoing conditions are for the
sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, may be asserted by Parent or Merger Sub
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to any such conditions, and may
be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from
time to time in their sole and absolute discretion (except for the Minimum
Condition), in each case, subject to the terms of the Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or Merger
Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.

 



I-2 For purposes of determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied,
Parent and Merger Sub shall have the right to include or exclude for purposes
of their determination thereof Shares tendered in the Offer pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures.
