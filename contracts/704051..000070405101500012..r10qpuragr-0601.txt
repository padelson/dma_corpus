net asset value of the relevant account on the fifth Business Day prior to the
date of this Agreement (after adjusting for the actual amount of any additions
and withdrawals occurring after the fifth Business Day prior to the date of this
Agreement and prior to the date of the withdrawal in question) and the
denominator of which is the net asset value of such account, prior to giving
effect to such withdrawal, on the date of such withdrawal; and provided further,

		  PURCHASE AND SALE; CLOSING; RELATED MATTERS

     Section 2.1 Purchase and Sale. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
		 -----------------
of this Agreement, each of the Sellers hereby agrees to sell to Buyer, free and
clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, and Buyer hereby
agrees to purchase from each of the Sellers, the Equity Interests of each of PCM
and CCC set forth opposite such Seller's name on Annex I hereto, and the Buyer
agrees to pay the Sellers therefor the aggregate consideration set forth in
Section 2.2. The Equity Interests being purchased by Buyer hereunder shall be
100% of the issued and outstanding Equity Interests of PCM and CCC and Buyer
shall not be obligated to purchase any Equity Interests unless it is obligated
to purchase all such Equity Interests.

     Section 2.2 Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall consist of the sum of
		 --------------
the following:

	     (a)     SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-TWO MILLION DOLLARS
($682,000,000.00) subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 2.12 hereof,
payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds at the Closing (the
"Initial Payment").

	     (b)     On a date no later than 60 days after the third anniversary
of the Closing, Buyer shall pay the Sellers by wire transfer of immediately
available funds a payment (the "First Earnout Payment," which shall be
accompanied by a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the calculation of
such payment) equal to the amount by which (i) the product of (A) 75% of Gross
Revenues for the twelve months ending on the last day of the calendar month
ending immediately prior to the month in which the third anniversary of the
Closing occurs times (B) ten exceeds (ii) the Initial Payment; provided,
however, that the aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 2.2(a) and this
Section 2.2(b) shall in no event exceed ONE BILLION EIGHTY-TWO MILLION DOLLARS
($1,082,000,000.00).

	     (c)     On a date no later than 60 days after the fifth anniversary
of the Closing, Buyer shall deliver the Claw-Back Amount, if any, to the Escrow
Account in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof and pay the Sellers by wire
transfer of immediately available funds the amount, if any, by which the Second
Earnout Payment (as hereinafter defined) exceeds THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS
($300,000,000), with the Second Earnout Payment being equal to the amount by
which (i) the product of (A) 75% of Year Five Gross Revenues times (B) nine
exceeds (ii) the sum of the Initial Payment plus the First Earnout Payment (the
"Second Earnout Payment," which shall be accompanied by a statement setting
forth in reasonable detail the calculation of such payment); provided, however,
that the aggregate amount payable pursuant to Sections 2.2(a) and (b) and this
Section 2.2(c) shall in no event exceed ONE BILLION THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY-TWO
MILLION DOLLARS ($1,382,000,000.00).

<PAGE>

	     (d)     If either Representative desires to dispute the calculation
of the Initial Payment, the First Earnout Payment, the Second Earnout Payment or
any payment under Section 2.15 (a "Payment Dispute"), then not later than 30
days following the relevant payment date, such Representative shall deliver to
Buyer and the other Representative a notice (the "Payment Dispute Notice")
describing in reasonable detail such Representative's objections to the
calculation of the disputed payment. Buyer and the Representatives shall in good
faith attempt to resolve any such Payment Dispute within 30 days following
delivery to Buyer of the Payment Dispute Notice. In the event that Buyer and the
Representatives are unable to resolve any such Payment Dispute within such 30
day period, such Payment Dispute shall be submitted for resolution to a
certified public accounting firm of national standing (an "Accounting Firm")
mutually acceptable to Buyer and the disputing Representative(s) or, if Buyer
and such Representative(s) are unable to agree on a single Accounting Firm, the
Buyer, on the one hand, and the disputing Representative(s), on the other hand,
shall select an Accounting Firm and such Accounting Firms shall, by mutual
agreement, select a third Accounting Firm to which such Payment Dispute shall be
submitted for resolution. Buyer and the Representative(s) shall use reasonable
efforts to cause the designated Accounting Firm to resolve such Payment Dispute
as soon as practicable after the designation of such Accounting Firm, and such
Accounting Firm's resolution of such Payment Dispute shall be final and binding.
The fees and expenses of such Accounting Firm(s) shall be shared equally by the
Sellers participating in the referral to the Accounting Firm, on the one hand,
and Buyer, on the other hand. If such determination results in an increase in a
payment to Sellers or a decrease in a payment to Buyer, Buyer shall promptly pay
such amount to the Sellers, together with interest thereon from the relevant
payment date at the rate of LIBOR plus 1%, to each Seller in accordance with the
Earnout Payment allocation provisions of Annex II hereto. If such determination
results in a decrease in a payment previously made to the Sellers, the Sellers
shall promptly pay such amount to Buyer, together with interest thereon from the
relevant payment date at the rate of LIBOR plus 1%, in accordance with the
Earnout Payment allocation provisions of Annex II hereto.

     Section 2.3 Purchase Price Percentages. The first ONE HUNDRED THREE MILLION
		 --------------------------
EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS ($103,890,209) shall be
paid to each Seller in the amount set forth opposite such Seller's name on the
Annex II hereto under the heading "Specific Initial Payment Amount". The
remaining portion of the Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date or any other
date to any Seller or into the Escrow Account for the account of any Seller
shall be the product of the percentage set forth opposite such Seller's name
under the column of the heading "Purchase Price Percentage" corresponding to
such payment on the schedule furnished by the Sellers and attached as Annex II
hereto (each a "Purchase Price Percentage" and collectively the "Purchase Price
Percentages") times the aggregate amount (less, in the case of the Initial
	      -----
Payment, without double-counting the amount paid in accordance with the
preceding sentence) of the portion of the Purchase Price payable on such date.

     Section 2.4 Payment Instructions. Each payment to a Seller under this

		 -----------
Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, One World Trade Center, New York, New York 10048

later than three Business Days) after the later of July 1, 2001 and the date on
which the last of the conditions set forth in Article VI hereof shall be
fulfilled or waived in accordance herewith (other than any conditions which can
only be fulfilled at the Closing) (the later of such dates, the "First Available
Date"); provided, however, that, if as of the First Available Date Buyer
determines, based on the advice of any of Buyer's placement agents or
underwriters, as applicable, that the then current conditions in the convertible
debt or debt capital markets are such as to make it advisable for Buyer to defer
the closing of any sale of its debt or convertible debt securities for up to ten
Business Days, Buyer may advise the Sellers in writing on or prior to the First
Available Date that it has decided to postpone the Closing for a period
specified in such notice (in no event to exceed 10 Business Days after the First
Available Date) and the Sellers hereby agree to any such postponement or (ii) at
such other time and place and/or on such other date as Buyer and the
Representatives may agree.

     Section 2.6 Further Assurances. The Sellers shall, from time to time after
		 ------------------
the Closing, at the request of Buyer and without further consideration, execute
and deliver further instruments of transfer and assignment and take such other
action as Buyer may reasonably require to more effectively transfer and assign
to, and vest in, Buyer the Equity Interests in PCM and CCC purchased by Buyer
hereunder. The Sellers and Buyer shall, from time to time after the Closing, at
the request of any party and without further consideration, take such other
action as may be required to fully implement the provisions of this Agreement
required to be implemented at that time. Any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
any of the Sellers or Buyer in the course of complying with this Section 2.6
shall be shared equally by the Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand.

     Section 2.7 Transfer Taxes. All sales, use, transfer, recording, ad
		 --------------
valorem, privilege, documentary, gains, stamp, duties or similar Taxes and fees
(collectively, the "Transfer Taxes"), arising out of, in connection with or
attributable to the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement shall be
borne and paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by the Sellers. The Person having
primary legal responsibility for the payment of any particular Transfer Tax (the
"Payor") shall prepare and timely file all relevant Tax Returns required to be
filed in respect of such Transfer Tax, pay the Transfer Tax shown on such Tax
Return, and notify the other parties in writing of the Transfer Tax shown on
such Tax Return and how such Transfer Tax was calculated.

		 ------------

Buyer under this Article II, each of which shall thereupon be treated as Buyer
for all purposes under this Article II (other than the definitions of Gross
Revenues and PCM Holdings) and the term "Buyer" shall thereafter be deemed to
refer to each such Wholly Owned Subsidiary and to Buyer, or to any one or more
of them individually or any two or more of them collectively, as the context may

				   ARTICLE III

			REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF
				   THE SELLERS

     Except as set forth in writing in a Schedule referencing the appropriate
section, subsection or clause of this Article III and delivered to Buyer on or
prior to the date hereof, each Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as
follows:

     Section 3.1 Organization of the Companies and Related Matters;
		 --------------------------------------------------
Capitalization. (a) Each of the Companies, ICMI, PCLG, and each of the Funds has
--------------
been duly organized as a corporation, limited liability company or limited
partnership, as the case may be, and is validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Companies, ICMI,
PCLG and each of the Funds has full corporate or other power and authority to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted, to own, lease and operate
all of its properties and assets, and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or
operated by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. The
organizational documents and operating or partnership agreements of each of PCM,
CCC, ICMI, PCLG and each of the Funds and any amendments thereto, complete and
correct copies of each of which as in effect on the date hereof have heretofore
been made available to Buyer, have been filed with or notified to all applicable
Governmental Authorities to the extent required by Applicable Law.

				      18
<PAGE>

	     (b)     All of the Equity Interests in each of PCM and CCC are duly
and validly authorized, issued, outstanding, fully paid, nonassessable (other
than the general partner interest in PCM) and owned of record and beneficially
by such Seller on the date of this Agreement as set forth on Annex I hereto free
and clear of any Encumbrances. All of the Equity Interests in ICMI are duly and
validly authorized, issued, outstanding, fully paid, nonassessable and owned of
record and beneficially by MCC free and clear of any Encumbrances. All of the
Equity Interests in PCLG are duly and validly authorized, issued, outstanding,
fully paid, nonassessable and owned of record and beneficially by PCM free and
clear of any Encumbrances. Upon the transfer of the Equity Interests in ICMI to
PCM Holdings immediately after the Closing, PCM Holdings will have good and
valid title to such Equity Interests in ICMI free and clear of any Encumbrances
other than Permitted Encumbrances. None of PCM, CCC or ICMI is subject to any
obligation, contingent or otherwise, to issue any Equity Interests to any
Person, there are no Equity Interests in PCM or CCC reserved for issuance for
any purpose and there are no outstanding bonds, notes or other indebtedness
having the right to vote on any matters on which Sellers may vote their Equity
Interests in PCM or CCC. Neither PCM nor CCC has any subsidiaries. Neither PCM
nor CCC owns any Equity Interests other than Equity Interests issued by the
Funds or by a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of such Company or short-term high quality
money market securities. None of the Equity Interests in PCM or CCC have been
issued in violation of any Applicable Law. Upon its admission as the sole
general partner and/or special limited partner, as the case may be, of each of
the Funds in substitution for PVEP, CFSI, SPSM or MCC, as applicable, PCM or a
Wholly Owned Subsidiary of PCM will have good and valid title to such Equity
Interests in such Funds, free and clear of any Encumbrances. Upon the delivery
of and payment for a Seller's Equity Interests in PCM and/or CCC, as the case
may be, at the Closing, as provided for in this Agreement, Buyer will acquire

consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly and validly approved by all requisite action on the part of each of
PCM, CCC and such Seller, as applicable, and no other proceedings on the part of
any of PCM, CCC or such Seller, as applicable, are necessary to approve this
Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement
has been duly executed and delivered by each of PCM, CCC and such Seller. The
Persons who executed this Agreement on behalf of PCM, CCC and such Seller, as
applicable, have been duly authorized to do so. Assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by Buyer, this Agreement constitutes

and by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium
and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally.

	     (b)     Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by any of PCM, CCC or such Seller nor the consummation by them of the
transactions contemplated hereby, will (i) violate, conflict with, or result in
a breach of any provisions of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in
the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a
right of termination or acceleration (which has not been expressly waived)
under, or the creation of any Encumbrance upon any of the Assets of PCM or CCC
or the Equity Interests in the Funds (other than Permitted Encumbrances) or any

PCM, CCC or such Seller is a party or by or to which it or any of its properties
may be bound or subject; or (ii) violate any Applicable Law except, in the case
of clauses (i)(y) and (ii) above, solely with respect to the Assets of PCM or
CCC or the Equity Interests in the Funds, for such violations, conflicts,
breaches, defaults, terminations or accelerations or Encumbrances that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

	     (c)     No material notice to, filing with, authorization of,
exemption by, or consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority that has not
been obtained or made is necessary for the consummation by the Companies or such
Seller of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     Section 3.3 Books and Records; Financial Statements; Liabilities. (a) Each
		 ----------------------------------------------------
of the Companies and each of the Funds has at all times since December 31, 1998
or its date of formation, whichever is later, maintained Records which
accurately reflect all its material transactions in reasonable detail.

	     (b)     The Sellers have previously delivered or caused to be
delivered to Buyer copies of balance sheets and income statements of PCM as of
December 31, 2000 compiled from the records of PCM and its predecessors (the
balance sheets and income statements above being referred to collectively as the
"Financial Statements" and the December 31, 2000 balance sheets as the "Balance
Sheets"). The balance sheets referred to in the previous sentence fairly present
in all material respects the financial position of PCM as of the date thereof,
and the other Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects the
results of the operations of PCM for the respective periods therein set forth.
The Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis. The Sellers have previously delivered or caused to be
delivered to Buyer copies of audited balance sheets and income statements for
CCC as of and for the periods ended December 31, 1998, 1999 and 2000 compiled
from the records of CCC (the balance sheets and income statements above being
referred to collectively as the "CCC Financial Statements" and the balance
sheets as the "CCC

				      20
<PAGE>

Balance Sheets"). The CCC Balance Sheets referred to in the previous sentence
fairly present in all material respects the financial position of CCC as of the
dates thereof, and the other CCC Financial Statements fairly present in all
material respects the results of the operations of CCC for the respective
periods therein set forth. The CCC Financial Statements have been prepared in
conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis.

	     (c)     Except for (i) liabilities that are fully reflected or
reserved against in the Balance Sheets or the CCC Balance Sheets, (ii)
liabilities incurred since the date of the Balance Sheets in the case of PCM or
the CCC Balance Sheets in the case of CCC which are recurrent in the Ordinary
Course of Business or which are not in the aggregate material to the business or
operations of PCM and CCC and (iii) liabilities the incurrence of which is
expressly permitted by this Agreement or authorized by Buyer in writing, neither
PCM and CCC has any material liabilities, whether absolute, accrued, contingent
or otherwise.

     Section 3.4 Compliance with Applicable Law. (a) Each of the Companies, each
		 ------------------------------
of the Funds, each employee of each of them and such Seller holds, and has at
all pertinent times held, all licenses, registrations, franchises, permits,
qualifications and authorizations (collectively, "Permits") necessary for the
lawful ownership and use of the respective properties and assets of such
Companies and the Funds and the conduct of their respective businesses under and
pursuant to every, and is in compliance with each, and are not in default under
any, Applicable Law relating to any of them or any of their respective assets,
properties or operations except for those licenses, franchises, permits,
qualifications and authorizations, the absence of which, and except for those
non-compliances and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
have a Seller Material Adverse Effect, and such Seller does not know of any
violations of any of the above and has not received notice asserting any such
violation. All such Permits are valid and in good standing and are not subject
to any proceeding for the suspension, modification or revocation thereof or
proceedings related thereto.

	     (b)     Except for normal examinations conducted by any
Governmental Authority in the regular course of the business of PCM, CCC and the
Funds, no Governmental Authority has at any time during the past five years
initiated or, to such Seller's knowledge, threatened any proceeding or
investigation into the business or operations of any of them with respect to the
business of PCM, CCC and the Funds or any of their officers, directors,
employees, shareholders or partners in their capacity as such. There is no
unresolved violation, deficiency, or exception by any Governmental Authority
with respect to any examination of PCM, CCC or the Funds.

	     (c)     PCM has and, to the extent any such agreement to which PCM
is a party was assigned to PCM by an Affiliate of PCM, each such Affiliate has,
at all times since December 31, 1996, rendered investment advisory services to
its investment advisory clients with whom it is or was a party to an investment
advisory agreement or similar arrangement in material compliance with all
applicable requirements as to portfolio composition and portfolio management
including, but not limited to, the terms of such investment advisory agreements,
written

				      21
<PAGE>

instructions from such investment advisory clients pursuant to such agreements,
the limited partnership agreements of the Funds, private placement memoranda or
other offering materials and Applicable Law. The assignment of investment
advisory agreements by MCC-PCM to PCM in 2000 was not an assignment for purposes
of the Advisers Act by reason of Rule 202(a)(1)-1 thereunder.

			   (d)      CCC has at all times since December 31,
1996, rendered brokerage services to its clients with whom it is or was a party
to a brokerage agreement or similar arrangement in material compliance with the
terms of such agreements and Applicable Law. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, CCC is duly registered with the SEC and all 50 states, the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and The District of Columbia as a broker-dealer.

			   (e)      PCM, CCC and each of the Funds timely has
filed all reports, registration statements and other documents, together with
any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to
file with any Governmental Authority (including, without limitation, on Forms
X-17A-5,U-4, BD and ADV), in a form which was accurate in all material respects
and appropriately responsive in all material respects to the requirements of
Applicable Law and has paid all fees and assessments due and payable in
connection therewith except failures to so file or pay which, individually or in
the aggregate, would not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. CCC's most
recent Form X-17A-5, as filed with the NASD, accurately sets forth CCC's net
capital on the date reported. CCC is not subject to any restriction on its
activities (other than those restrictions provided for generally in the Exchange
Act or the rules and regulations of the NASD).

			   (f)      As of their respective dates, the
Governmental Documents of PCM, CCC and the Funds complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Laws applicable to such
Governmental Documents. The Sellers have previously made available to Buyer a
complete copy of each Governmental Document filed by any of the foregoing
entities since December 31, 1996 and prior to the date hereof.

		  Section 3.5 Ineligible Persons. None of PCM, CCC, such Seller
			      ------------------
or any of the officers, directors or employees of or any person associated (as
such term is defined in Section 3(a)(18) of the Exchange Act) with PCM or CCC
has had imposed or, to the knowledge of such Seller, is threatened by the SEC or
the NASD with, any (A) censure, (B) limitation on otherwise authorized
activities, functions, or operations, (C) suspension or (D) revocation, in each
case pursuant to Section 203 of the Advisers Act or Section 15(b)(4) of the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations of the NASD, as the case may be. None
of PCM, CCC, such Seller or any of the officers, directors or employees of PCM
or CCC is (A) a person described in Section 9(a)(1), (2) or (3) of the
Investment Company Act, or (B) subject to a statutory disqualification (as such
term is defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act).

				      22
<PAGE>

		  Section 3.6 Assets Under Management. The aggregate amount of
			      -----------------------
assets under management by the Companies as of March 31, 2001, the amount of
assets under management by the Companies for each account and for each of the
Funds, together with the Revenue Run Rate for each such account or Fund as of
the fifth Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement, and any material fee
adjustments or waivers ($25,000 or more on an annualized basis) are accurately
set forth in Schedule 3.6 hereto. There are no agreements or understandings in
effect pursuant to which any of the Companies has capped, waived or reimbursed
or will under any circumstances cap, waive or reimburse any or all fees, profit
allocations or charges payable by or allocable from any of their clients
(including the Funds) or any limited partners in the Funds in excess of $10,000
per client or limited partner and $500,000 in the aggregate on an annualized
basis. No current client of PCM for which it manages more than $10 million or
current limited partner of any of the Funds whose capital account exceeds $10
million has expressed an intention since June 30, 2000 and prior to the
execution of this Agreement to terminate or substantially reduce its
relationship with PCM or make substantial withdrawals from its capital account,
no current client or limited partner has expressed such an intention in writing
during such period and on the date hereof such Seller has no reason to believe
any such client or limited partner will terminate or substantially reduce its
relationship with the Companies or make substantial withdrawals from its capital
account, as the case may be.

		  Section 3.7 Title. Neither PCM nor CCC owns any real property.
			      -----
Each of PCM and CCC has good and marketable title to, or the right to use, all
of its Assets which are necessary, and such Assets are sufficient, to conduct
its business as conducted currently and CCC has good and insurable leasehold
interests in all of the Leased Properties, in each case free and clear of all
Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. The only Operating Sites are
the Leased Properties.

		  Section 3.8 Company Contracts. Schedule 3.8 lists under
			      -----------------
separate headings, and the Sellers have made available to Buyer copies of: (a)
each Company Contract that is not cancellable without penalty by the Company
party thereto upon 90 days or less notice or that involves the receipt or
payment by such Company in the prior fiscal year (or is reasonably likely to
involve the receipt or payment by such Company in the current fiscal year) of an
amount in excess of $250,000 or (b) each Company Contract (other than investment
advisory agreements, the limited partnership agreements of the Funds and
agreements for the provision of brokerage services) with one or more of the
Sellers or members of their Immediate Families or entities in which any of them
has greater than a 5% equity interest, and (c) each other Company Contract
material to the business, governance, operations or financial condition of PCM
and CCC, taken as a whole. The Sellers have made available to Buyer copies of
all sales, marketing and account solicitation agreements and marketing
arrangements in use by the Companies with respect to their investment advisory
businesses and the Funds. Each of PCM, CCC and, to the knowledge of such Seller,
each other party to such Company Contracts has performed all its material
obligations under each Company Contract listed on Schedule 3.8, in each case, to
the extent that such obligations have accrued; and no breach or default, alleged
breach or default, or event which constitutes or would (with the passage of
time, notice or both) constitute a breach or

				      23
<PAGE>

default thereunder, or would permit termination or acceleration thereof by any
party thereto, has occurred, or, as a result of this Agreement or the
performance by such Company of any of its covenants or obligations hereunder,
will occur except for those failures to perform or those actual or alleged
breaches or defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company Contracts limits the freedom
of PCM or CCC to compete in any line of business or with any Person and none of
PCM or CCC is subject to any requirement of exclusive dealing with any other
Person anywhere in the world or with respect to any product. Each Company
Contract has been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by the
Company which is a party thereto and, assuming the due authorization, execution
and delivery of such Company Contract by the other party or parties thereto,
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of each such other party
thereto, enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, except
as enforcement thereof may be limited by general principles of equity whether
applied in a court of law or a court of equity and by bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting
creditors' rights and remedies generally.

		  Section 3.9 Technology and Intellectual Property.
			      ------------------------------------

			   (a)      The electronic data processing, information,
recordkeeping, communications, telecommunications, portfolio trading and
computer systems and Intellectual Property (including Software) which are used
by PCM or CCC in their respective businesses (collectively, the "Technology
Systems") are adequate for their intended use and for the operation of such
businesses as currently operated. One or more of PCM or CCC owns or has the
right to use all components of the Technology Systems that are reasonably
necessary to the normal operations of their respective businesses as currently
conducted by them. There has not been any material malfunction with respect to
any of the Technology Systems since December 31, 1996 that has not been remedied
or replaced in all material respects. The completion of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not materially alter or impair the ownership
or right of PCM or CCC to use the components of the Technology Systems. No trade
secret, know how, model, process, formula, database or Software created by any
of PCM or CCC included in the Intellectual Property of PCM or CCC has been
disclosed or authorized to be disclosed to any third-party other than for use in
connection with the businesses of PCM and CCC or pursuant to a confidentiality
or non-disclosure agreement that reasonably protects the interest of PCM and CCC
in and to such matters.

			   (b)      All Intellectual Property registrations
owned by PCM or CCC are valid and subsisting, are held in the name of PCM or CCC
and validly maintained. No Intellectual Property application or registration
owned by PCM or CCC is the subject of any pending, existing or threatened
opposition, interference, cancellation proceeding or other legal or governmental
proceeding before any registration authority in any jurisdiction. The conduct of
the businesses of PCM and CCC does not infringe upon any intellectual property
right owned or controlled by any third-party. There are no claims, proceedings
or actions pending or, to the best of such Seller's knowledge, threatened, and
none of PCM or CCC has received any notice of any

				      24
<PAGE>

claim or suit (i) alleging that their respective activities infringe upon or
constitute the unauthorized use of the proprietary rights of any third-party or
(ii) challenging the ownership, use, validity or enforceability of any
Intellectual Property owned or controlled by any of PCM or CCC, nor is there, to
the best of such Seller's knowledge, a valid basis for any such claim or suit.
To the best of such Seller's knowledge no third-party is infringing upon any
Intellectual Property owned by PCM or CCC, and no such claims have been made by
PCM or CCC.

Companies is a party to any, and there are no, legal, administrative, arbitral
or other proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory
investigations of any nature pending or, to such Seller's knowledge, threatened
against any of them or any of their respective properties or assets relating to
the business of PCM, CCC or the Funds, or that challenges the validity or
legality of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or which
seeks to prevent the consummation of such transactions and there is no

of them or any of their respective properties, Assets, partners, members,
managers, directors, officers or employees relating to the business of PCM, CCC
or the Funds.

amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under all Applicable Laws.

			       ---------
with reputable insurers such worker's compensation, comprehensive property and
casualty, liability, errors and omissions, fidelity and other insurance as is
described on Schedule 3.12 hereto, which insurance is, in the reasonable opinion
of the Sellers, sufficient for the operation of the business of PCM and CCC as
currently conducted. All such policies are in full force and effect, all
premiums due and payable have been paid, and no notice of cancellation or
termination has been received with respect to any such policy.

		  Section 3.13 Labor and Employment Matters.

material respect in payments to any of its current or former officers,

of termination of the employment of any employee of any of PCM or CCC, none of
PCM or CCC will be liable to any such employee under any agreement in effect at
the Closing for so-called "severance pay," incentive pay, liquidated damages or
any other payments or benefits, including, without limitation, post-employment
health care, pension or insurance benefits.

employment with it for discrimination or harassment on account of sex, race or
other characteristic protected by law and there are no such proceedings pending

or CCC or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below) for the benefit of any employee
or former employee of PCM or CCC (the "Plans"). For purposes of this Agreement,
"ERISA Affiliate" means any trade or business, whether or not incorporated,
that, together with any of PCM or CCC would be deemed a "single employer" within
the meaning of section 4001(b) of ERISA. With respect to each Plan, the Sellers
have heretofore delivered or made available to Buyer true and complete copies of
each of the following documents: (i) a copy of the Plan and any amendments

Service Form 5500; (iii) a copy of the most recent Summary Plan Description

trust or other funding agreement and the latest financial statements thereof and
all related agreements; and (v) the most recent determination letter or pending

ERISA.

			   (b)      None of PCM or CCC or any ERISA Affiliate
(i) has ever maintained any Plan which has been subject to Section 412 of the
Code, Title IV of ERISA or any similar law of any other jurisdiction or (ii) has
ever provided or agreed to provide health care or any other welfare benefits (as

Section 419 of the Code.

			   (d)      Each Plan has been operated in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and applicable law, including but not

within the meaning of Code section 401(a) is so qualified and has received a
favorable determination letter to such effect, and no event has occurred and no
condition exists that could reasonably be expected to cause or result in the
revocation of such

				      27
<PAGE>

determination letter. No non-exempt prohibited transaction (within the meaning

matter pending with respect to any of the Plans before any Governmental

employee or beneficiary covered thereunder, or otherwise involving any such Plan
(other than routine claims for benefits).

			       ---------
fees shall be paid by the Sellers, no broker, finder or similar intermediary
has acted for or on behalf of any of the Companies or such Seller, or is
entitled to any broker's, finder's or similar fee or other commission from any
of the Companies or such Seller in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

		  Section 3.16 Absence of Changes. Since December 31, 2000, the
			       ------------------
Companies have not suffered any Seller Material Adverse Effect and, except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, none of the Companies or any of the

			       ----------------------------------------------

			   (a)      Except with respect to the Funds, none of
the Companies acts or during the past five years has acted as the sponsor,
general partner, managing member, trustee, investment manager or investment
adviser, or in any capacity similar to any of the foregoing, with respect to any
vehicle for collective investment (in whatever form of organization, including,
without limitation, in the form of a corporation, limited liability company,
partnership (limited or general), association, trust or other entity and

such vehicle for collective investment as to which any of them has acted or acts
solely in a subadvisory capacity).

offering documents, subscription agreements, administrative services agreements,
distribution agreements, solicitation agreements and custody agreements, as
applicable, or any similar agreements, in any case pertaining to the Funds and

documents did not, at any time such offering documents were made available to
investors or prospective investors in the Funds, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

				      28

			   (c)      True, correct and complete copies of the
audited financial statements of each of the Funds for the fiscal years completed
on or after December 31, 1998 or its inception, whichever is later, through its
most recent fiscal year ended on or prior to March 31, 2001 have been made
available to Buyer. Each of such financial statements is consistent with the
books and records of the applicable Fund and presents fairly the consolidated
financial position of such Fund in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis (except as otherwise noted therein) at the respective date of such
financial statements and the results of operations, changes in partners' equity
and cash flows for the respective periods indicated.

			   (d)      Since inception,  each of the Funds has been
excluded from the definition of an investment company under the Investment
Company Act by virtue of Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) thereof.

			   (e)      All limited partner interests in each of the
Funds were sold pursuant to a valid exemption from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act and other applicable Securities Laws.

more of the Funds) by PCM and brokerage accounts with CCC, after the Closing
neither any Seller nor any of its Affiliates will have any interest in any
property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) or contract used in or
pertaining to the business of PCM or CCC, nor, other than pursuant to Section

deducting all goodwill on its balance sheet, (a) be insolvent (either because
its financial condition

Date. For purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Sellers contained in Article III in order to determine the
fulfillment of the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) and in order to
determine whether Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Article VII,
the Schedules delivered by the Sellers shall be deemed to include only that
information contained therein on the date of this Agreement and shall be

				      34
<PAGE>

deemed to exclude any information contained in any subsequent supplement or
amendment thereto.

	     (c)     The Sellers shall prepare and deliver or cause to be

     Section 5.2 Advisory Contract Consents; The Funds.
		 -------------------------------------

	     (a)     As soon as reasonably practicable, PCM shall inform, in
compliance with Applicable Law, its investment advisory clients of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall request such clients'
written consent to the assignment of their investment advisory agreements
resulting from the change in control of PCM and CCC contemplated hereby and use
all reasonable efforts to obtain such consent or, in the case of agreements
which prohibit assignment or a change in control or state by their terms that
they terminate upon assignment or a change in control, new agreements (and any
required director and investor approvals) with the relevant Company, effective
upon Closing. Buyer agrees that, except as set forth in the last sentence of
this Section 5.2(a), PCM may obtain sufficient consent for purposes of this
Agreement by (a) requesting written consent as aforesaid, (b) if such client has

requesting written consent again as aforesaid and informing such client of (i)
the intention to assign such investment advisory agreement by completing the

advisory services pursuant to the existing investment advisory agreement with
such client after the Closing Date if such client does not terminate such
investment advisory agreement prior to the Closing Date, and (iii) that the
consent of such client will be implied if such client continues to accept such
advisory services for at least 30 days after receipt of such notice without
termination and (c) not receiving prior to the Closing an oral or written
indication of an intent to terminate such investment advisory agreement or
otherwise withhold consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
less than twenty (20) of the twenty-five (25) largest accounts (excluding, at

prior to the date of this Agreement) of PCM (including the Funds) measured by
the amount in U.S. dollars of assets under management in such account as of the
close of business on the fifth Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement

Day prior to the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of the
investment advisory agreement applicable to such account) have provided written
consent (including by written confirmation by PCM copied to Buyer of actual
consent communicated to PCM by the client) as of a scheduled Closing Date, the
Buyer shall not be required to acknowledge that consents have been received from
such accounts that have failed to provide such written consent and may require
that such accounts be treated as having been

				      35
<PAGE>

terminated for purposes of calculation of the Aggregate Revenue Run Rate as of
the fifth Business Day prior to the Closing solely for purposes of the condition
set forth in Section 6.2(c).

	     (b) The Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
PCM or a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of PCM to be admitted as the sole general
partner and/or special limited partner, as the case may be, of each of the Funds
in substitution for PVEP, CFSI, SPSM or MCC, as applicable.

     Section 5.3 Confidentiality and Announcements.

Buyer's historical results and future plans, shall disclose publicly any of the
contents hereof.

		 --------
with the required HSR filings. Except as provided elsewhere herein, the Sellers

Affiliates, incurred in connection with the negotiation and preparation of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

		 ------------------
Agreement and continuing through the Closing Date, except with the prior written
consent of the Sellers, Buyer shall not take any action, or fail to take any
action, that would, or could reasonably be expected to, (i) result in any of
Buyer's representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement being or
becoming untrue in any material respect; (ii) result in a material violation of
any provision of this Agreement; (iii) adversely affect or materially delay the
receipt of any requisite consents, regulatory approvals or the Closing; or (iv)

investigations shall be conducted in a manner which does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations, clients and employee relations of any of
the Companies. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall cause the officers and
employees of the Companies to furnish to Buyer and its officers, employees,
representatives, counsel and accountants such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to the business, properties and assets of the
Companies as Buyer or any such Person shall from time to time reasonably
request, and shall cause each Company and its respective directors, partners,

Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer agrees that any meetings between
Buyer and Company personnel shall be arranged in advance by the Chief Executive
Officer of PCM or his designee. No investigation pursuant to this Section 5.6 or
otherwise shall affect or limit the representations and warranties of the
Sellers set forth herein.

     Section 5.7 Regulatory Matters; Third Party Consents. (a) The Sellers, on

use all reasonable efforts promptly to prepare and file all necessary

obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities and to satisfy
all conditions to the obligations of any party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If any required consent of or waiver by any
third party (excluding any Governmental Authority and consents of clients under
investment advisory agreements) is not obtained prior to the Closing, the
Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be, each without cost, expense or liability to
the other, shall cooperate in good faith to seek an alternative arrangement to
achieve the economic results intended.

	     (b)     Buyer and the Sellers will have the right to review in
advance, and will consult with the other on, in each case subject to Applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to
Buyer or the Companies or the Funds, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Affiliates, which appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided,
								 --------
however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to provide any party with
-------
a right to review any information provided to any Governmental Authority on a
confidential basis in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The
parties hereto agree that they will consult with each other with respect to the

				      37
<PAGE>

obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third
parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated herein. The party responsible for a filing shall promptly deliver
to the other parties evidence of the filing of all applications, filings,
registrations and notifications relating thereto, and any supplement, amendment
or item of additional information in connection therewith. The party responsible
for a filing shall also promptly deliver to the other parties a copy of each
material notice, order, opinion and other item of correspondence received by
such filing party from any Governmental Authority in respect of any such
application (except for any confidential portions thereof).

     Section 5.8 Notification of Certain Matters. At all times prior to the
		 -------------------------------
Closing, the Sellers and Buyer shall each give prompt notice to the other of (i)
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event or existence of any condition
that has caused or could reasonably be expected to cause any representations or
warranties made by it in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect at any time after the date of this Agreement, up to and
including the Closing Date, and (ii) any failure on its part to comply with or
satisfy, in any material respect, any of its covenants or agreements in this

Company, each of the Sellers agrees that damages at law will be an insufficient
remedy to the Company in the event that such Seller violates any of the terms of
Section 5.13 and that the Company may apply for and is entitled to injunctive
relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the breach or
threatened breach of, or otherwise to specifically enforce, any of the covenants
of such Section, in each case without proof of actual damages. Buyer hereby
expressly acknowledges and agrees that no violation of this Section 5.13 by any

				 INDEMNIFICATION

     Section 7.1 Obligations of the Sellers. From and after the Closing Date,
		 --------------------------
the Sellers hereby agree severally (and not jointly) to indemnify and hold Buyer
and its Affiliates and Persons (other than Bruce S. Sherman and Gregg J. Powers)
serving as officers, directors, partners, stockholders or employees thereof
(each individually a "Buyer Indemnified Party" and collectively the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against any and all Losses which any of
them may suffer, incur or sustain arising out of, or attributable to, or
resulting from any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or
warranties of the Sellers (which representations and warranties shall not be
deemed to be qualified by references to materiality (or variations thereof)
contained therein for purposes of this Section 7.1 and any breaches thereof
shall be determined without regard to whether such breaches were material or
constituted a Seller Material Adverse Effect for purposes of this Section 7.1),
or any nonperformance of any covenant or agreement of the Sellers or the
Companies, made in or pursuant to this Agreement or in any Schedule attached
hereto or in any other agreement, document, instrument or certificate delivered
by the Sellers to Buyer at the Closing pursuant to this Agreement. Each Seller
shall be solely and fully responsible, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 7.7, for any Loss arising out of, attributable to or resulting from any
inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty or nonperformance of
any covenant or agreement made solely by such Seller, it being understood and
agreed that any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by "such
Seller" or by a Seller by name shall be considered to be made solely by each
Seller with respect to himself only or solely by the named Seller (any such
Losses, "Direct Seller Losses"). With respect to any other Loss for which the
Sellers are responsible hereunder, each Seller shall, subject to the limitations
set forth in Section 7.7, be responsible for each such Loss pro rata in
proportion to such Seller's Purchase Price Percentage with respect to the
Earnout Payments.

     Section 7.2 Obligations of Buyer. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer
		 --------------------
hereby agrees to be liable for, and to indemnify and hold each Seller and each
Person serving as an officer, director, partner, stockholder or employee
thereof, as applicable, or of the Companies (each individually a "Seller
Indemnified Party" and collectively the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and

arising out of, or attributable to, or resulting from any inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer (which
representations and warranties shall not be deemed to be qualified by references

Section 7.2 and any breaches thereof shall be determined without regard to
whether such breaches were material or constituted a Buyer Material Adverse
Effect for purposes of this Section 7.2), or any nonperformance of any covenant

     Section 7.3 Procedure. (a) Notice of Third Party Claims. Any Indemnified
		 ---------      ----------------------------
Party seeking indemnification for any Loss or potential Loss arising from a
claim asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party (each, a "Third
Party Claim") shall give written notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party within
10 days after its receipt of a written assertion of liability from the third
party; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not be foreclosed
       --------  -------
from seeking indemnification pursuant to this Article VII as a result of any
failure to provide timely notice of the existence of a Third Party Claim to the
Indemnifying Party except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has
been materially damaged or prejudiced as a result of such delay. Such notice
shall summarize the bases for such Third Party Claim. Within twenty (20) days
after receiving such notice the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to
the Indemnified Party stating whether it disputes its obligation to provide
indemnification hereunder or the validity or amount of such Third Party Claim
and whether it will defend against such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party fails to give notice that it disputes either its obligation hereunder with
respect to such claim or the validity or amount thereof within twenty (20) days
after receipt of such notice, it shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to
such Third Party Claim, which shall become immediately due and payable subject
to the limitations set forth herein. If the Indemnifying Party fails to give
notice that it disputes its obligation to provide indemnification hereunder but
disputes the validity or amount of such Third Party Claim, it shall be deemed to
have accepted responsibility for such Third Party Claim subject to the
limitations set forth herein (a "Covered Third Party Claim"). If the
Indemnifying Party provides notice that it disputes its obligation to provide
indemnification hereunder, such Third Party Claim shall not be subject to
indemnification hereunder unless the Indemnified Party obtains a determination
in accordance with Section 9.1 that such Third Party Claim is subject to
indemnification hereunder, in which case it shall be treated as a Covered Third
Party Claim.

	     (b)     Defense. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
		     -------
Indemnifying Party may elect to compromise or defend, at such Indemnifying
Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own counsel (which counsel
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), any Third Party
Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to compromise or defend such Third Party
Claim, it shall, within 30 days after receiving notice of the Third Party Claim,
notify the Indemnified Party of its intent to do so, and the Indemnified Party
shall cooperate, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party, in the compromise of,
or defense against, such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects not
to compromise or defend against the Third Party Claim, or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party of its election to do so as herein provided, or otherwise
abandons the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may pay
(without prejudice of any of its rights as against the Indemnifying Party),
compromise or defend such Third Party Claim including the costs and expenses of
the Indemnified Party incurred in connection therewith. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, in connection with any Third Party Claim in
which the Indemnified Party shall reasonably conclude, based upon the written
advice of its counsel, that (x) there is a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of
such Third Party Claim, or (y) there are specific defenses available to the
Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party and which could be materially

				      49
<PAGE>

adverse to the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to be represented by counsel selected by it. In such an event, the
reasonable fees and disbursements of a single counsel to the Indemnified Party
shall be included in the loss suffered by the Indemnified Party in respect of
such Third Party Claim. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed
the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party
Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnifying Party shall have
assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to
any settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third Party Claim which the
Indemnifying Party may recommend and which by its terms obligates the
Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with
such Third Party Claim, which releases the Indemnified Party completely in
connection with such Third Party Claim and which would not otherwise adversely
affect the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any
claim, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party any
personnel or any books, records or other documents within its control that are
reasonably necessary or appropriate for such defense, subject to the receipt of
appropriate confidentiality agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
incurred by the Indemnified Party in defending such Third Party Claim) if the
Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other equitable relief or relief
for other than money damages against the Indemnified Party which the Indemnified
Party reasonably determines, based on the opinion of its outside counsel, cannot
be separated form any related claim for money damages. If such equitable relief
or other relief portion of the Third Party Claim can be so separated from that
for money damages, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the
defense of the portion relating to money damages.

	     (c)     Miscellaneous. The procedures set forth in this Section 7.3
		     -------------
shall apply solely with respect to Third Party Claims and shall not be deemed to
apply to, or otherwise affect or limit, an Indemnified Party's rights under this
Agreement with respect to any claim other than a Third Party Claim.

     Section 7.4 Notice of Non-Third Party Claims. Any Indemnified Party seeking

indemnification for any Loss or potential Loss arising from a claim asserted by
any party to this Agreement (a "Non-Third Party Claim") shall give written
notice to the Indemnifying Party. Written notice to the Indemnifying Party of
the existence of a Non-Third Party Claim shall be given by the Indemnified Party
promptly after discovery of the potential claim; provided, however, that the
						 --------  -------
Indemnified Party shall not be foreclosed from seeking indemnification pursuant
to this Article VII by any failure to provide timely notice of the existence of
a Non-Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying Party except and only to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party has been materially damaged or prejudiced as a
result of such delay. Such notice shall summarize the bases for such Non-Third
Party Claim. Within twenty (20) days after receiving such notice the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party stating
whether it disputes its obligation to provide indemnification hereunder or the
validity or amount

				      50
<PAGE>

of such Non-Third Party Claim and whether it will defend against such Non-Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party fails to give notice that it disputes
either its obligation hereunder with respect to such claim or the validity or
amount thereof within twenty (20) days after receipt of such notice, it shall be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to such Non-Third Party Claim, which shall
become immediately due and payable subject to the limitations set forth herein.
If the Indemnifying Party fails to give notice that it disputes its obligation
to provide indemnification hereunder but disputes the validity or amount of such
Non-Third Party Claim, it shall be deemed to have accepted responsibility for
such Non-Third Party Claim subject to the limitations set forth herein (a
"Covered Non-Third Party Claim"). If the Indemnifying Party provides notice that
it disputes its obligation to provide indemnification hereunder the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a
resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such
dispute shall be resolved in accordance with Section 9.1 hereof.

     Section 7.5 Handling of Claims. If, with respect to any claim seeking
		 ------------------
indemnification, the Indemnifying Party is more than one of the Sellers, all
decisions relating to such claim made by the Sellers constituting the
Indemnifying Party shall be made by the Representatives or, if such claim is
against only one Seller, by the Representative of such Seller.

     Section 7.6 Survival of Indemnity. Any matter as to which a claim has been
		 ---------------------
specifically asserted in writing that is pending or unresolved at the end of any
applicable limitation period set forth in Section 8.3 hereof shall continue to
be covered by this Article VII notwithstanding any applicable statute of
limitations (which the parties hereby waive) until such matter is finally
terminated or otherwise resolved in accordance with this Agreement and any
amounts payable hereunder are finally determined and paid.

     Section 7.7 Limitation on Indemnification. No Seller shall be required to
		 -----------------------------
provide any indemnification under the provisions of this Article VII (a) unless
and until the aggregate Losses of the Buyer Indemnified Parties hereunder exceed
$15 million whereupon the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled only to
indemnification from such Seller in an amount (i), in the case of Direct Seller
Losses, equal to the amount by which such Losses exceed $15 million and (ii), in
the case of all other Losses, an amount equal to the product of the aggregate
cumulative amount of all such Losses in excess of $15 million multiplied by such
Seller's Purchase Price Percentage with respect to the Earnout Payments or (b)
after such Seller has made aggregate indemnification payments hereunder in an
amount, in the case of Direct Seller Losses, equal to $500 million minus the
aggregate amount of all indemnification payments made by the Sellers hereunder
and, in the case of all other Losses, an amount equal to the product of $500
million multiplied times such Seller's Purchase Price Percentage with respect to
the Earnout Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in the
preceding sentence or in Section 7.1, (i) Losses incurred by Buyer as a result
of any failure of any Seller's representations with respect to such Seller's
title to the Equity Interests in the Companies set forth in Section 3.1(b) or
with respect to Taxes or ERISA matters set forth in Sections 3.11 or 3.14 to be
true at the date hereof or on the Closing Date shall not be subject to the
limitations set forth in this Section 7.7, (ii)

				      51
<PAGE>

Direct Seller Losses relating to any of the Companies or PCM GP as opposed to
the capacity, title, qualification or compliance of, or action or inaction by, a
Seller who is an individual acting in his individual capacity shall not be
treated as Direct Seller Losses but as all other Losses and (iii) if the amount
of Loss and Direct Seller Loss payable by a particular Seller pursuant to this
Article VII (other than clause (b)(i) above) would exceed the portion of the
Purchase Price paid to such Seller, such Seller shall not be responsible for the
amount of any further Losses or Direct Seller Losses in excess of the portion of
the Purchase Price paid to such Seller pursuant to this Article VII (other than
clause (b)(i) above) and the remaining Sellers shall, subject to their
limitations, be responsible for any such excess Losses or Direct Seller Losses
in the proportion that their Purchase Price Percentage with respect to the
Earnout Payments bears to the sum of the Purchase Price Percentages with respect
to the Earnout Payments of such remaining Sellers. Buyer shall not be required
to provide any indemnification under the provisions of this Article VII (x)
unless and until the aggregate Losses of the Seller Indemnified Parties exceed
$15 million whereupon the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be entitled only to
indemnification for the aggregate cumulative amount of all such Losses in excess
of $15 million or (y) after Buyer has made aggregate indemnification payments
hereunder of not less than $500 million. To the extent Buyer waives or fails to
pursue its rights to indemnification from or against any Management Seller with
respect to any particular claim, it shall also waive its right to
indemnification with respect to such claim from any Collier Seller. For purposes
of the foregoing sentence, a good faith settlement shall not be treated as a
waiver or failure to perform if made available to each Collier Seller.

     Section 7.8 Indemnity Payments and Interest. All amounts payable to an
Indemnified Party under this Article VII shall be paid in immediately available
funds within 5 Business Days after the later of written demand for payment by
the Indemnified Party or final determination of the amount of such Loss by a
court or agreement of the Indemnifying Party. All such payments shall be made to
the accounts and in the manner specified in writing by the Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnifying Party fails to pay any indemnifiable Loss suffered by an
Indemnified Party within such 5 Business Day period, then the indemnification
payment hereunder shall include interest at LIBOR plus 1% from such 5th Business
Day or date of final determination until the date of payment.

			      TERMINATION/SURVIVAL

     Section 8.1 Termination. (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time
		 -----------
prior to the Closing as follows:

		     (i)     by the mutual written consent of Buyer and the
Representatives;

		     (ii)    by either Representative if it has become
reasonably certain that any of the conditions to the Sellers' obligation, or by
Buyer if it has become reasonably

				      52
<PAGE>

certain that any of the conditions to Buyer's obligation, to close the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement will not be satisfied in all material
respects on or prior to the date set forth in Section 8.1(a)(v) below;

		     (iii)   by either Representative on behalf of the Sellers,
on the one hand, or by Buyer, on the other hand, if there shall have been a
breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement
on the part of the other, which breach would, under Section 6.2(a) (in the case
of a breach of representation or warranty by any of the Sellers) or Section
6.3(a) (in the case of a breach of representation or warranty by Buyer), entitle
the party receiving such representations and warranties not to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and which breach by its nature cannot be cured
prior to the date set forth in Section 8.1(a)(v) below;

		     (iv)    by either Representative on behalf of the Sellers,
on the one hand, or by Buyer, on the other hand, if there shall have been a
material breach of any of the covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement on the part of Buyer (in the case of termination by a Representative)
or on the part of any of the Sellers or the Companies (in the case of
termination by Buyer), which breach shall not have been cured within 20 Business
Days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice of such breach
from the other;

		     (v)     at the election of Buyer or either Representative,
if the Closing Date shall not be on or before the end of the fifth month after
the month of signing of this Agreement; and

		     (vi)    by either Representative or by Buyer if an order,
injunction or decree shall have been issued by any Governmental Authority or any
statute, rule or regulation shall have been enacted, promulgated or enforced by
any Governmental Authority, in either case which permanently prohibits or makes
illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and is not
subject to appeal.

     Notwithstanding Section 8.1(a)(ii) - (v) hereof, a party who is in material
breach of any of its obligations or representations and warranties hereunder
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(a)(ii) - (v).

	     (b)     The termination of this Agreement shall be effectuated by
the delivery by the party terminating this Agreement to the other party or
parties of a written notice of such termination. If this Agreement so
terminates, it shall become null and void and have no further force or effect,
except as provided in Section 8.2.

				      53
<PAGE>

     Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
		 ---------------------
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement (other than Sections 5.3
and 5.4) shall forthwith become void and have no effect except that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no party
shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.

     Section 8.3 Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants.
		 --------------------------------------------------------
Except as provided in Section 7.6, the respective representations and warranties
of the Sellers and Buyer contained herein and in the certificates of the Sellers
and Buyer to be delivered at the Closing, and the right of any Person to
initiate a claim under Article VII hereof with respect to such representations
and warranties (or any other matter hereunder), shall expire and be terminated
and extinguished on the earlier of the 30th day after the completion of the
second audit of the Companies to occur after the Closing Date or June 30, 2003
(other than the representation with respect to a Seller's title to the Equity
Interests in the Companies set forth in Section 3.1(b), which shall survive in
perpetuity, and the representations with respect to Taxes set forth in Sections
3.11 and 3.14, which shall survive until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations). Thereafter, except as provided in Section 7.6, no party
shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to any such referenced
representation or warranty (or any other matter hereunder to be performed prior
to Closing). Each of the covenants which by its terms contemplates performance
after the Closing (including, without limitation, Sections 5.11 and 5.14) shall
remain in full force and effect after the Closing Date.

				   ARTICLE IX

				  MISCELLANEOUS

     Section 9.1 Disputes. Except for requests for pre-arbitral injunctive
		 --------
relief or enforcement of the award of an arbitrator, all disputes arising in
connection with this Agreement that cannot be resolved by the parties shall be
resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with the applicable rules of the
American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), which shall be the sole and exclusive
method of resolving any such dispute. The arbitration shall be conducted and the
award shall be rendered in the City of New York or such other place as the
parties to the arbitration agree before a panel of arbitrators comprised of one
arbitrator selected by the Representatives (or, if the dispute involves only one
or more Collier Seller, the Collier Representative or, if the dispute involves
only one or more of the Management Sellers, the Management Representative) and
one arbitrator selected by Buyer who shall jointly select a third arbitrator who
shall chair the tribunal, and such arbitration shall otherwise be conducted in
accordance with such association's Commercial Arbitration Rules. Each arbitrator
shall be a retired judge or a practicing attorney with no less than fifteen
years of experience as such and shall be experienced in arbitration and in the
investment advisory industry. The arbitrators shall be required to follow the
law of the state of New York. The arbitrators are not empowered to award damages
in excess of compensatory damages, and each party hereby irrevocably waives any
right to recover punitive, exemplary or similar damages with respect to any
dispute. The award of such arbitrators shall be enforceable in any court having
jurisdiction over the parties to such arbitration.

     The expenses of arbitration (including fees and expenses of counsel) shall
be borne by the party against whom the decision is rendered, or apportioned in
accordance with the decision of the arbitrators in the event of a compromise
decision. The arbitral award shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgment
upon any award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. All
notices relating to any arbitration hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
effective if given in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.7. The
arbitration provisions set forth herein shall be governed by the Federal
Arbitration Act, Title 9, United States Code.

     By agreeing to arbitration, the parties do not intend to deprive any court
of its jurisdiction to issue a pre-arbitral injunction, pre-arbitral attachment,
or other order in aid of arbitration proceedings and the enforcement of any
award. Without prejudice to such provisional remedies as may be available under
the jurisdiction of a court, the arbitral tribunal shall have full authority to
grant provisional remedies or modify or vacate any temporary or preliminary
relief issued by a court, and to award damages for the failure of any party to
respect the arbitral tribunal's orders to that effect. Each party understands
and agrees that the other parties will be irreparably damaged in the event its
obligations under this Agreement are not specifically enforceable. Each party,
therefore, agrees that in the event of a breach of any material provision of
this Agreement, the aggrieved party may elect to institute and proceed as
provided above.

				      55
<PAGE>

     Section 9.2 Representatives. Each Management Seller hereby authorizes
		 ---------------
Bruce S. Sherman and each Collier Seller hereby authorizes Miles C. Collier (in
such capacity, together with any successor in such capacity, the "Management
Representative," the "Collier Representative," respectively, and collectively,
the "Representatives,") to make any determinations or take any actions on behalf
of any or all of the Management Sellers or the Collier Sellers, respectively,
that are authorized in this Agreement to be made or taken by the
Representatives. Either Representative may resign at any time provided, however,
that immediately prior to any such resignation, such Representative has
appointed a successor or substitute to serve as a Representative and such
appointee has accepted such appointment. In the event of the incapacity or death
of either Representative without having resigned and appointed a successor, a
successor Representative shall be appointed by the estate or representative of
the deceased or incapacitated Representative.

     Section 9.3 Exclusive Remedy. After the Closing the sole and exclusive
		 ----------------
remedy of any party for any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, or any
breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation made in connection with this
Agreement and required to be performed prior to the Closing shall, subject to
Section 8.3, be the indemnification contained in Article VII of this Agreement.
Without limiting the scope of the foregoing, Buyer shall have no right to assert
any liability against any Seller by reason of such Seller having been a partner,
director, officer or employee of any of the Companies or any of the limited
partnership agreements or operating agreements thereof but only in such Seller's
capacity as a Seller under this Agreement.

     Section 9.4 Amendments; Waiver. Subject to compliance with Applicable Law,
		 ------------------
this Agreement may be amended, altered or modified by written instrument
executed by Buyer and the Representatives; provided, however, that the
Representatives may waive in writing on behalf of all the Sellers the
performance by Buyer of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
other agreements and that Buyer may waive in writing the performance by any of
the Sellers or the Companies of any of their respective representations,
warranties covenants or other agreements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
amendment, alteration or modification of Article II, Article III or Article VII
of this Agreement or of this Section 9.4 that adversely affects the rights of
any Seller shall be effective as to such Seller without the written consent of
such Seller and no amendment, alteration or modification of this Agreement shall
impose any material obligation on any Seller without the written consent of such
Seller.

     Section 9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Employment Agreements,
		 ----------------
the Revenue Sharing Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Schedules and
Annexes hereto constitute the entire understanding and agreement of the Buyer,
on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, except as provided herein,
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, written and oral, among
the Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, with respect to
the subject matter hereof.

     Section 9.6 Interpretation. When a reference is made in this
		 --------------
Agreement to a Section, Annex or Schedule, such reference shall be to a Section

     Section 9.7 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is
		 ------------
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so
broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so
broad as is enforceable.

		   REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT
				BY AND AMONG
			      LEGG MASON, INC.
			     PCM HOLDINGS, INC.
		      PRIVATE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P.
			CARNES CAPITAL CORPORATION
				   AND
		     THE PRINCIPAL OFFICERS NAMED BELOW


     THIS REVENUE SHARING AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made and entered
into as of May 30, 2001, by and among LEGG MASON, INC., a Maryland
corporation ("Legg Mason"); PCM HOLDINGS, INC., a Maryland corporation
("PCM Holdings"); CARNES CAPITAL CORPORATION, a Florida corporation
("CCC"), PRIVATE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership ("PCM"), and Bruce S. Sherman and Gregg J. Powers, who are
the principal officers of PCM Holdings and PCM (collectively, the
"Principal Officers"). PCM Holdings, PCM and all other existing and any
future direct or indirect subsidiaries of PCM Holdings are each referred
to in this Agreement as a "Company," and collectively as the "Companies."

WHEREAS, pursuant to a Purchase Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the
"Acquisition Agreement"), by and among Legg Mason, PCM, the Principal
Officers and the other related parties named therein, PCM Holdings is
acquiring all of the equity interests of PCM and CCC;

<Page> 2

and WHEREAS, the parties desire to afford the management of the Companies
discretion with respect to the day-to-day operations of the Companies in
light of existing management's demonstrated ability to manage PCM and CCC
profitably;

and WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire to enter into certain
agreements regarding revenues, expenses and management of the Companies
deemed necessary by the parties to foster the continued growth and
expansion of the Companies' business;and

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual premises herein contained
and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, agree as follows:

1. Revenues.
     (a)  Definition of Gross Revenues. The term "Gross Revenues" shall
mean all revenues of the Companies during the term of this Agreement,
from whatever source derived, calculated on an accrual basis, beginning on
the date of this Agreement, in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied ("GAAP"), reduced by any
writeoffs of uncollectible receivables which are earned after the closing
under the Acquisition Agreement.  This Agreement relates solely to
operating revenues of the Companies and nothing in this Agreement
is intended to deal, directly or indirectly, with all or any portion of
any proceeds of a sale of all or any part of the Companies or of any
sale of the Companies' assets effected in connection with the sale of all
or part of the Companies' business hereunder or the gain arising from
the sale of assets of the Company in the ordinary course, all of which
proceeds or gain shall be distributed to Legg Mason.

<PAGE> 3

      (b)  Allocation of Gross Revenues. For each fiscal year of PCM
Holdings during the term of this Agreement and , on a pro rata basis,
quarterly during each such fiscal year:

	     (i)     PCM Holdings shall distribute or cause to be
distributed to its immediate parent company 80% of the combined Gross
Revenues of all Companies for each fiscal year or portion thereof in the
period commencing on the Closing Date (as defined in the Acquisition
Agreement) and ending on the last day of the month containing the third
anniversary of the Closing Date and 75% of the combined Gross Revenues of
all Companies during each fiscal year or portion thereof thereafter
(the "Legg Mason Distribution"); and

	     (ii)    the Companies shall retain for application as provided
in this Agreement 20% of the combined Gross Revenues of all Companies for
each fiscal year or portion thereof in the period commencing on the
Closing Date and ending on the last day of the month containing the third
anniversary of the Closing Date, and 25% of the combined Gross Revenues
of all Companies for each fiscal year or portion thereof thereafter
(the "Retained Operating Revenues").

	     (iii)   PCM Holdings shall make distributions of the
Legg Mason Distribution within five (5) business days after the
determination of the amount of the Legg Mason Distribution pursuant to
Section 1(e) below. PCM, CCC and any other subsidiaries of PCM Holdings
shall timely make any distributions to PCM Holdings which are required
for PCM Holdings to make distributions of the Legg Mason Distribution.
The Companies shall have the same fiscal year-end as Legg Mason during
the period that they are direct or indirect subsidiaries of Legg Mason.

<PAGE> 4
     (c)  Retained Operating Revenues.

	     (i)     Retained Operating Revenues shall be applied by the
Companies to pay and provide for all of the Companies' expenses and
expenditures, which, except as provided herein, shall be determined in
accordance with GAAP ("Company Expenditures"), including, without
limitation: (A) all salaries and employee benefits of their employees
other than the compensation component of any stock options provided by
Legg Mason or any of its subsidiaries other than PCM Holdings and its
subsidiaries; (B) all liabilities of the Companies to third parties;
(C) all intercompany liabilities from the Companies to Legg Mason or its
subsidiaries, other than the Companies (Legg Mason and its subsidiaries
other than the Companies are individually referred to as a "Legg Entity,"
and collectively as "Legg Entities") including, without limitation,
expenses incurred by Legg Entities on behalf of the Companies upon
authorization by the Principal Officers; (D) all liabilities of the
Companies for federal, state or local taxes (and any interest or penalties
in respect thereof), licenses or registration fees pertaining to the
operations of the Companies after the closing under the Acquisition
Agreement (except for any foreign and federal, state or local taxes on
income of the Companies and the Legg Entities (and any interest or
penalties in respect thereof), which shall be the responsibility of Legg
Mason and shall not be treated as an expense of the Companies); (E)
depreciation and amortization (other than amortization of PCM Holdings
resulting from PCM Holding's acquisition of the ownership interest in
PCM and CCC under the Acquisition Agreement); (F) minor capital
expenditures (which shall be expensed and not capitalized); and (G)
interest payments to Legg Mason pursuant to this Agreement. For purposes
of this Agreement, a "minor capital expenditure" shall mean any single
expenditure for real or personal property in the amount of $1,000 or less
and any other capital expenditures paid for in the year of incurrence
out of Retained Operating Revenues.  The Principal Officers will use their

<PAGE> 5

best efforts to cause the Companies to not incur expenses or obligations
that exceed the Companies' ability to pay or provide for them when due
out of Retained Operating Revenues.

	     (ii)    If the Companies expect to request the funding of
non-minor capital expenditures by Legg Mason, such funding shall be
discussed in advance by the parties. If Legg Mason agrees to fund a
non-minor capital expenditure, such expenditure shall be amortized on
the books and records of the Companies over a period of time determined
in accordance with Legg Mason's practice current at the time of the
expenditure consistent with GAAP, and Legg Mason's funding of such
expenditure shall be repaid to Legg Mason in accordance with the
amortization schedule, together with interest at the rate specified in
Section 1(f)(C) hereof or such other rate agreed to by the parties.
Legg Mason shall be under no obligation to agree to fund
any capital expenditure, and any failure of Legg Mason to so agree shall
not constitute a breach of this Agreement.

      (d)  Incentive Pool. To provide an incentive to the Principal
Officers and other key employees of the Companies, the Companies shall
establish an incentive compensation pool ("Incentive Pool") from which
they will authorize distributions of bonuses to such employees ("Bonus
Distributions"). The Incentive Pool shall be equal to the balance (if any)
of the Retained Operating Revenues remaining after subtraction of all
Company Expenditures other than Bonus Distributions with respect to a
year. The Chief Executive Officer of PCM Holdings (the "CEO") shall
recommend to the Management Committee of PCM Holdings pursuant to Section
2(b) (the "Management Committee") the recipients and amounts of all Bonus
Distributions. Bonus Distributions in any given year shall be paid annually
upon, and subject in all respects to, approval by the PCM Holdings Board,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Bonus

<PAGE> 6

Distributions shall not be paid in excess of the sum of (i) the current
Incentive Pool and (ii) to the extent the Company has not distributed all
or part of the Incentive Pool for a prior fiscal year, all or part of such
previously undistributed Incentive Pool amounts. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, no Bonus Distributions shall be paid
or committed to any employee of any of the Companies unless and until PCM
Holdings is current with respect to its required distributions of the Legg
Mason Distribution, including the payment in full of principal of and
interest on all working capital loans made pursuant to Section 2(f).
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall establish or be deemed to
constitute an obligation of the Companies to any particular employee of
any of the Companies to pay bonuses or other compensation to such employee,
or restrict the right of the Companies to terminate the employment of
any employee at any time, with or without cause.

      (e)  Determination of Amounts. The amount of Gross Revenues, the
Legg Mason Distribution, Retained Operating Revenues, Company Expenditures
and the Incentive Pool shall be determined in accordance with this
Agreement by the Principal Officers, subject to approval by the PCM Holdings
Board, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed: (i)
within 30 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters
in a fiscal year based on the most recent unaudited consolidated quarterly
financial statements of the Companies; and (ii) within 40 days after the
end of the last fiscal quarter based on the audited annual financial
statements. Any adjustments to the Legg Mason Distribution, Retained
Operating Revenues or the Incentive Pool which are required as a result of
the year-end audit of the annual financial statements shall be made by
appropriate adjustment to the quarterly distribution for such last
fiscal quarter.

<PAGE> 7

      (f)  Conversion to Working Capital Loan. If PCM Holdings fails to
distribute to its immediate parent company all or a portion of the Legg
Mason Distribution for any fiscal quarter as required under Section 1(b),
Legg Mason may, in its sole and absolute discretion and in lieu of
treating such failure as a default under this Agreement, elect to convert
PCM Holdings' obligation to make such distribution into a working capital
loan from Legg Mason which: (A) has an original principal amount equal to
the undistributed portion of the Legg Mason Distribution; (B) is payable
on demand; (C) bears interest at the rate of one-half of one percent
(0.5%) in excess of the broker-call rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal on the day Legg Mason makes the election, compounded annually;
(D) may be prepaid by PCM Holdings at any time and from time to time;
and (E) at Legg Mason's request, shall be evidenced by a promissory
note containing such other terms and conditions as are reasonably
acceptable to Legg Mason.

      (g)     Nondeductibility of Expenses. In the event that (i) all or
any portion of the base or incentive compensation, including Bonus
Distributions, of any Company employee, or (ii) all or any portion of
any other Company Expenditures (excluding, however, capital expenditures
that are amortizable or depreciable for state or federal income tax
purposes, repayment of the principal balance of any Company indebtedness
and any expenditures (such as entertainment expenses) to the extent the
same are only partially deductible under law in effect at the date of
this Agreement), are, in the reasonable judgment of Legg Mason, not fully
and currently deductible (unless the current nondeductibility is due
solely to a timing difference between GAAP and tax accounting that causes
a particular Company Expenditure to be deductible for tax purposes in a
fiscal year different from the fiscal year in which the expense was
accrued under GAAP) under federal or state tax laws, rules or regulations
(including, without limitation, any judicial or administrative rulings or
interpretation thereof), Legg Mason shall have the right to

<PAGE> 8

restructure the revenue allocation arrangements reflected in this Agreement
in such a manner (including, without limitation, increasing the Legg
Mason Distribution) as will put Legg Mason in as favorable an economic
position as if such compensation and other Company Expenditures were fully
and currently deductible to the extent provided above; provided that,
to the extent more than one alternative restructuring is available which
will put Legg Mason into such economic position, Legg Mason shall choose
that alternative which has the least adverse effect
on the amount of the Incentive Pool.

      (h)  Key-Man Life Insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (i) any premiums paid by the Companies on life insurance policies on
which Legg Mason or any of its affiliates other than the Companies is the
beneficiary ("Key-Man Policies") shall not be considered Company
Expenditures and shall be paid either by funds provided by Legg Mason or
an affiliate of Legg Mason other than the Companies; (ii) any death benefit
or other proceeds paid or payable to the Companies under a Key-Man Policy
shall not be considered Gross Revenues; and (iii) all or any portion of
said death benefit or other proceeds received by the Companies as described
in the preceding clause (ii) shall be payable to Legg Mason (at such
times and in such amounts as Legg Mason elects in its sole discretion),
in addition to any Legg Mason Distribution to which Legg Mason is
otherwise entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

	    (i)  Applicable Laws. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
construed to require distributions to Legg Mason in violation of
applicable laws relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or the like, or
applicable laws restricting payments of dividends or the making of
other payments or distributions to shareholders.

<PAGE> 9

2.  Management of the Companies.

      (a)     Board of Directors.

	      (i)     Each of the Companies shall be managed by a Board of
Directors or a general partner managed by a Board of Directors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Board of Directors may, without
the prior written consent of a majority of the Principal Officers: (A)
require any of the Companies to engage in any business other than the
Business or accept or retain any Person as a client of the Business or
change any level of fees or commissions for any business; (B) appoint
any person as a Principal Officer of the Companies without the prior
written consent of Bruce J. Sherman (if he is a Principal Officer) and
Gregg J. Powers (if he is a Principal Officer); or (C) cause to be paid
any dividend, distribution, advance or loan of any amount to Legg Mason
or any affiliate of Legg Mason other than (1) the Legg Mason
Distribution, (2) interest on or repayment of any advance authorized by
Section 1(c)(ii) or 1(f), (3) proceeds from any Key-Man insurance and
(4) proceeds from the sale of any assets.  Legg Mason shall have the right
at all times to designate a majority of the Boards of Directors of each
Company that is a corporation or limited liability company (individually
a "Board" and collectively the "Boards"), and each of the Companies shall
vote all of their shares of voting stock of their subsidiaries, if any, in
favor of Legg Mason's designees. Subject to the requirements of the next
sentence, the Boards shall have such number of members as shall be
determined by Legg Mason, which initially for PCM Holdings shall be five.
Both the CEO of PCM Holdings and the President of PCM Holdings
("President") shall be members of each Board and of each committee
thereof during the term of this Agreement; provided, however, that
should the employment of either the CEO or the President with all of the
Companies be terminated for any reason while such person is a director of

<PAGE> 10

any Company, that person shall be promptly removed from the Board of such
Company and each committee thereof and the resulting vacancies thereon
shall be filled by the remaining members of the Board of Directors
with the successor CEO or President, as the case may be.

	      (ii)    The articles of incorporation or limited liability
company agreement of PCM Holdings and each other Company that is a
corporation or limited liability company shall provide that: (A) a quorum
of the Board shall consist of a majority of the directors in office,
attending in person or by teleconference, of which at least one (1) shall
be a director designated by Legg Mason; (B) decisions of the Board may
be made only upon a vote of the Board in which at least one (1) director
designated by Legg Mason votes in favor of the decision of the majority;
and (C) any Board action not taken by unanimous written consent shall only
be taken at a meeting or via teleconference for which each director has
been provided no less than 72 hours advance notice.

	      (iii)   During the Term of this Agreement Legg Mason shall,
on a basis consistent with the practices of the Legg Entities, oversee the
operation of the business of the Companies in good faith with the objective
of (1) building and maintaining a successful investment management advisory
business and (2) subject to the exercise by the Board in good faith
of its rights under Section 2(d), supporting the Companies' efforts to
achieve the Earnout Payments provided for in the Acquisition Agreement
consistent with the Companies efforts to pursue and develop high margin
equity asset management products and services.

      (b)  Management Committee. A Management Committee shall be established
promptly after the closing under the Acquisition Agreement.  It shall
consist of the Principal Officers employed by PCM Holdings at any given
time, including the then CEO and the then President. One or more other
key employees of any Company who are not Principal Officers may be

<PAGE> 11

appointed by the CEO, subject to the approval by the Board, to serve on
the Management Committee for varying terms as may be designated by the
Board and who shall be removed from such service at the request of the
CEO. Except as provided in subsection (d) below and subject to
any limitations imposed by law, the Management Committee shall consult
with the CEO and the President concerning the day-to-day operations of
the Companies.

      (c)     Chief Executive Officer.

	     (i)     The CEO of PCM Holdings shall be responsible for the
overall management and operation of the Companies consistent with the terms
of this Agreement with advice from the Management Committee and subject
to general supervision by the Board. The Chief Executive Officer of PCM
Holdings shall also be the chief executive officer of each of the
Companies, subject to the Chief Executive Officer's authority to appoint
and remove any other person as chief executive officer of any of the other
companies. The Chief Executive Officer of PCM Holdings shall have the
general powers and duties of management usually vested in such office,
which shall include the power, subject to the Board's authority, to (A)
hire, establish the compensation levels (subject to the Employment
Agreements (as hereinafter  defined)) and other conditions of employment
for, and supervise and discharge employees of such Company, and
(B) enter into contracts not requiring approval by the Board.

	     (ii)In the event that, for any reason, Bruce S. Sherman shall
no longer be CEO of PCM Holdings, Gregg J. Powers shall be the CEO of
PCM Holdings. In the event that, for any reason, neither Bruce S. Sherman
nor Gregg J. Powers shall be the CEO of PCM Holdings, the Board of
Directors of PCM Holdings shall select his successor (and any subsequent
successor) as CEO of PCM Holdings.

<PAGE> 12

      (d)     Board Approval. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 2(a)(i), the Board of PCM Holdings shall have exclusive authority
to take action on the matters set forth below (subject to any shareholder
approval of such matters which may be required under applicable
law), and decisions by the Board on such actions may be made only upon a
vote of the majority of the full Board:

	      (i)     any amendment to any employment agreement with any
employee of any of the Companies (the "Employment Agreements"), any change
in the contractual compensation or benefits of any employee who is a
party to an Employment Agreement, other than as permitted under such
employee's Employment Agreement, or any other material change in the
terms of employment of any of such employees, provided that contributions
to nondiscretionary, nonterminable benefit plans as approved by the
Board (so long as such contributions are made pursuant to the terms of
such plans and in accordance with applicable law) will not require
separate Board approval;

	      (ii)  any agreement or arrangement, whether written or
oral, which imposes an obligation (1) in an amount in excess $1,000,000;
provided that the aggregate outstanding obligations under such agreements
or arrangements shall not exceed $4,000,000 at any time and no such
agreement or arrangement shall have a term in excess of five years, or
(2) which is not in the ordinary course of business;

	      (iii)  the issuance, repurchase or redemption (or any
agreement regarding the issuance, repurchase or redemption) of any
securities of any of the Companies;

	      (iv)  the acquisition by the Company for its own account
of any other business, or of the equity securities or debt securities of,
or the making of any loan or advance to, any other entity, or the entering

<PAGE> 13

into of any joint venture, profit sharing or similar agreement involving
expenditures or sharing of revenues by the Companies in an amount in excess
of $1,000,000;

	      (v)  a material alteration in the fundamental businesses of
the Company (said business for purposes of this provision being deemed to
be the management of investment accounts for individual and institutional
clients and the sponsorship and management of pooled investment vehicles,
the "Business") or its basic policies and procedures, or the initiation of
any business that is materially different from such fundamental businesses,
or the addition of new products, including investment company or annuity
products, that are in conflict with any Legg Mason product or would result
in Legg Mason or any of its affiliates being deemed to be in
violation of any obligation under an existing contract or arrangement to
which Legg Mason or any of its affiliates is a party or is subject;

	      (vi)  the sale, exchange, lease or hypothecation of a
substantial part of the assets of the Companies in any manner;

Section 6(d) below;

aggregate;

<PAGE> 14

	      (xi)  the employment of any professional personnel under an
employment contract for a term exceeding two years;

	      (xii)   the removal of any director designated by Legg Mason;

	      (xiii)  the appointment of, or delegation of responsibilities
to, any committee of the Board other than as provided herein;

	      (xiv)   the election of officers of the Companies, which
shall be in accordance with the terms of the Employment Agreements;

or by any such officer, director or senior management employee.

	      (xvi)   the termination of employment of any Principal Officer
or any other employee who is a party to an employment agreement which
requires Board approval under Section 2(d)(xi)above or the granting of
any waiver or consent which would relieve any such Principal Officer or
employee from any obligation or restriction under such employment
agreement;

	      (xvii)  the payment of any dividend other than those provided
for in this Agreement;

      (e)  During the Initial Term (as defined in Section 4), Legg Mason
shall not require Bruce S. Sherman or Gregg J. Powers to serve as an
officer, director, consultant or investment adviser or otherwise participate
in the management, investment activities or promotion of any Person
other than a Company.

3.  Administration. The Parties hereto agree to meet and consult to
endeavor in good faith to agree on appropriate procedures for administering
the provisions of this Agreement.

4.  Term and Status as Parties. This Agreement shall continue in effect
for eight (8) years from the closing under the Acquisition Agreement
(the "Initial Term") at which time it shall automatically be renewed unless
terminated pursuant to this Section or by mutual agreement of Legg Mason,
the Companies and the Principal Officers. If the employment of any Principal
Officer by all of the Companies ceases for any reason, such Principal
Officer shall thereupon automatically cease to be a party to this
Agreement and to have any rights hereunder and shall cease to be a
Principal Officer for the purposes of this Agreement. At the election
of Legg Mason, any replacement CEO

<PAGE> 16

(who is not already a Principal Officer) shall become a Principal Officer
for purposes of this Agreement and become a party hereto. In the event
that there are no Principal Officers party to this Agreement employed by
the Companies, Legg Mason may, at its election, terminate this Agreement.
In the event one or more of the Principal Officers cause the Companies
to be in a material default under this Agreement and fail to cure such
default within thirty (30) days after notice thereof from Legg Mason
(unless Legg Mason prevents such cure) or in the event the Companies are
unable to make any three consecutive Legg Mason Distributions within
five business days of the required date of such payment as specified
in Section 1(b)(whether or not a working capital loan is established
pursuant to Section 1(f) hereof and whether or not such distributions
are prohibited from being made as referred to in Section 1(i)), Legg Mason
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement, effective upon written
notice to the other parties hereto.

of a Company (or any direct or indirect parent thereof, other than
Legg Mason) shall be deemed an assignment by Legg Mason in violation of
the terms of this subsection (d), unless Legg Mason shall be the direct or
indirect parent of the successor entity, in which case the other parties'
consent shall not be required. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their heirs, personal representatives, successors and permitted assigns.

hereto, nothing herein, either express or implied, is intended or shall
be construed to give any person, other than Legg Mason, PCM Holdings, PCM,

<PAGE> 20

CCC and the Principal Officers, any rights or remedies under or
by reason of this Agreement; provided, however, that, in order to induce
the Collier Sellers (as such term is defined in the Acquisition Agreement)
to enter into the Acquisition Agreement, each of the Collier Sellers is
intended to be, and hereby is made for the Initial Term of this
Agreement, an "intended third-party beneficiary" of the provisions
contained within Sections 2(a), (b), (c) and (e), 5(a) -(d) inclusive,
5(g) and 6(d) and such provisions shall be enforceable by the Collier

      (k)  Arbitration. (i) If a majority of the Principal Officers
notifies the other parties hereto that they object to the final
determination of the amount of the Incentive Pool for any fiscal year,
such Principal Officers and the other parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any differences. If after fifteen (15) days
following such notice (the "Negotiation Period") any of such objections

have not been resolved (the "Disputed Matters"), then such Disputed Matters
shall be submitted to arbitration in Washington, D.C. by any of such
persons. The arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") shall be Endispute. The
Arbitrator shall consider only the Disputed Matters, and the arbitration
shall be conducted in accordance with Endispute's Arbitration Rules then
in effect and the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. SS 1-16.
The Arbitrator shall act promptly to resolve all Disputed Matters and
its decision with respect to all Disputed Matters shall be final
and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be appealable to
any court. The Arbitrator shall render an opinion in writing setting
forth the basis of its decision on the Disputed Matters. The
costs and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be shared equally by Legg
Mason and the Companies; provided, however, that the Companies' share of
such cost and expense shall be treated as a Company Expenditure. A
Principal Officer who does not object may monitor the arbitration at
his expense and shall be entitled to notice of, and to attend, all
arbitration proceedings. Any portion of the Incentive Pool that is
affected by the Disputed Matters shall not be distributed until
the resolution of the Disputed Matters, and upon such resolution any
increase in the Incentive Pool shall be distributed to all participants
in the Incentive Pool as determined by a majority of the Principal
Officers. (ii) If a majority of the Principal Officers believe that any
of the Companies or Legg Mason, or if Legg Mason believes that any of the
Principal Officers or the Companies, has breached this Agreement in any
respect other than as described in clause (i) above, the affected parties
shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their differences during the
Negotiation Period and thereafter any matter remaining in dispute may be
submitted to arbitration as provided in clause (i).
