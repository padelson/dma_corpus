 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER 

   

 Section 3.01 _Effects of the Merger on Company Securities_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company or the holders of any capital stock of the Company (other than the requisite 

    ##### 

  

    

approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company in accordance with
the DGCL): 

   

 (a) Each Company Common Share held in treasury by the Company or any Company Subsidiary and each Company Common Share that is owned by Parent or MergerCo (or by any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or MergerCo) immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution shall be made with respect thereto. 

   

 (b) Each Company Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time (other than Company Dissenting Shares and Company Common Shares to be cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.01(a)_), shall be converted and exchanged automatically into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $32.00 per Company Common Share (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder thereof in accordance with _Section 3.03_. At the Merger Effective Time, all such Company Common Shares which have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such Company Common Share immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest. The Company Common Shares and the Company Restricted Shares that are to be so converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration are referred to herein as the " _Merger Shares_ ". 

   

 (c) Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, each outstanding qualified or nonqualified option to purchase Company Common Shares (" _Company Stock Options_ ") under any employee or director share option or compensation plan or arrangement of the Company (collectively, " _Incentive Plans_ ") shall become fully vested and exercisable (whether or not then vested or subject to any performance condition that has not been satisfied, and regardless of the exercise price thereof). At the Merger Effective Time, each Company Stock Option not theretofore exercised shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section 3.05_ with respect to such payment) determined by multiplying (x) the excess of the Merger Consideration over the applicable exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option by (y) the number of Company Common Shares subject to such Company Stock Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "). Payment of the Option Consideration shall be made in accordance with Section _3.03_ , and each holder of any Company Stock Options immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Consideration. 

   

 (d) Immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, each outstanding share of restricted stock granted under the Incentive Plans, whether vested or unvested (the " _Company Restricted Shares_ "), shall become fully vested and payable (whether or not then vested or subject to any performance condition that has not been satisfied). At the Merger Effective Time, each Company Restricted Share shall be cancelled in 

    ##### 

  

    

exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger
Consideration, plus any declared and unpaid dividends, without interest and
less any applicable Taxes required to be withheld in accordance with _Section
3.05_ with respect to such payment. Payment of the Merger Consideration to
the holders of Company Restricted Shares shall be made in accordance with 
_Section 3.03_. At the Merger Effective Time, all Company Restricted Shares
which have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of any such Company
Restricted Shares immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. 

   

 Section 3.02 _Effects of the Merger on MergerCo Securities_. At the Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by MergerCo or Parent, as the holder of all outstanding capital stock of Merger Co (other than the requisite approval by the sole stockholder of MergerCo in accordance with the DGCL, which approval will be obtained immediately following the execution hereof), each outstanding common share, par value $0.01 per share, of MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable common share, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 3.03 _Payment of Merger Consideration; Stock Transfer Books_. 

   

 (a) Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company shall appoint as paying agent a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the " _Company Paying Agent_ "). At or prior to the Merger Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit with the Company Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Merger Shares and Company Stock Options, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration required to be paid plus cash in an amount sufficient to pay holders of Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares, in accordance with this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation Fund_ "). The Surviving Corporation Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) The Surviving Corporation Fund shall be invested by the Company Paying Agent in (i) direct obligations of the United States of America, (ii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for payment of all principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, or a combination thereof, as directed by and for the benefit of the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to the holders of Merger Shares and Company Stock Options following completion of the Merger pursuant to this  _Article III_ and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure that the Surviving Corporation Fund includes at all times cash sufficient to satisfy Parents obligation under this  _Article III_.

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) As promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, but in no event more than three (3) Business Days following the Merger Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Company Paying Agent to mail to each person who was, as of immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, a holder of record of the Merger Shares or Company Stock Options (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form approved by the Company and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates representing the Merger Shares (the " _Company Common Share Certificates_ ") or uncertificated Merger Shares represented by book entry (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Company Common Share Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Company Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Company Common Share Certificates, the transfer of the Uncertificated Shares or the surrender of Company Stock Options, as applicable, in exchange for the Merger Consideration or the Option Consideration, as applicable. 

   

 (d) Upon (i) surrender to the Company Paying Agent of Company Common Share Certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions or (ii) compliance with the reasonable procedures established by the Company Paying Agent for delivery of Uncertificated Shares or surrender of Company Stock Options, the holder of such Company Common Share Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or Company Stock Options, as applicable, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, in cash, the aggregate Merger Consideration in respect thereof calculated in accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_, _Section 3.01(c)_ or _Section 3.01(d)_, as applicable, in the form of a check, to be mailed within three (3) Business Days of receipt by the Company Paying Agent of such Company Common Share Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or Company Stock Options, as applicable, and the Company Common Share Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or Company Stock Options, as applicable, so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any stockholder of the Company who beneficially owns in excess of thirty percent (30%) of the outstanding Company Common Shares provides to the Company wire transfer account information and otherwise complies with this  _Section 3.03_ at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, such stockholder shall receive the Merger Consideration to which such stockholder is entitled pursuant to _Section 3.01(b)_ by wire transfer from the Company Paying Agent immediately after the Merger Effective Time. 

   

 (e) In the event of a transfer of ownership of Merger Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of the applicable Merger Shares may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Company Common Share Certificates so surrendered or Uncertificated Shares so transferred are registered if such Company Common Share Certificates shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall be properly transferred and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the 

    ##### 

  

    

Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as contemplated by this
_Section 3.03_, each Company Common Share Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall be deemed at all times after the Merger Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on any cash payable
to holders of Company Common Share Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or
Company Stock Options pursuant to the provisions of this  _Article III_. 

   

 (f) Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Merger Shares or Company Stock Options for one (1) year after the Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of Merger Shares or Company Stock Options who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration or Option Consideration, as applicable. Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares or Company Stock Options as of the date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the Company Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Merger Shares or Company Stock Options for cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

   

 (g) If any Company Common Share Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Company Common Share Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company Common Share Certificate, the Company Paying Agent shall pay in respect of Merger Shares to which such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Common Share Certificate relate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled. 

   

 (h) At the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Merger Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Merger Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Share Certificates, Uncertificated Shares or Company Stock Options shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, or by applicable Law. 

   

 Section 3.04 _Company Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Common Shares or Company Restricted Shares that are outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal of such Company Common Shares or Company Restricted Shares pursuant to, and who complies 

    ##### 

  

    

in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (such Section, " _Section
262_," and, such Company Common Shares, " _Company Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as
provided in _Section 3.01(b)_ or _Section 3.01(d)_ , but rather, the holders
of Company Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the fair
value of such Company Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 (and,
at the Merger Effective Time, such Company Dissenting Shares shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist,
and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the fair value of such Company Dissenting Shares in
accordance with Section 262); _provided_ that if any such holder shall fail to
perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal
under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such holders Company Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Company
Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Merger
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (without interest thereon) as provided in
_Section 3.01(b)_ or _Section 3.01(d)_. The Company shall notify Parent as
promptly as reasonably practicable of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of any Company Common Shares or Company Restricted Shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, the Company
shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), voluntarily make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
or agree to do any of the foregoing. 

   

 Section 3.05 _Withholding Rights_. The Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Shares, Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, or paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority (including any taxing authority) by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Paying Agent, as applicable, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares, Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Shares, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Company Paying Agent, as applicable. 

   

 Section 3.06 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the aggregate Merger Consideration and Option Consideration to be paid at Closing pursuant to _Sections 3.01(b)_,  _3.01(c)_ and _3.01(d)_ is increased by more than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) as a result of the Companys breach of its representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.03(a)_ and _4.03(b)_ (the amount of such increase above One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) being referred to herein as the " _Excess Amount_ "), the Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration shall be ratably and equitably reduced so that the aggregate Merger Consideration and Option Consideration to be paid at Closing 

    ##### 

  

    

pursuant to _Sections 3.01(b)_, _3.01(c)_ and _3.01(d)_ is reduced by
an amount equal to the Excess Amount. In the event that, and only to the
extent permitted by  _Section 6.01(b)_, the Company changes (or establishes
a record date for changing) the number of Company Common Shares or Company
Restricted Shares, as applicable, issued and outstanding prior to the Merger
Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding Company Common
Shares or Company Restricted Shares, as applicable, at any time during the
period from the date hereof to the Merger Effective Time, then the Merger
Consideration and Option Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted,
taking into account the record and payment or effective dates, as the case
may be, for such transaction.

    ##### 

  

    

propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Company Acquisition

this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, and subject to the Companys compliance in all material
respects with the other provisions of this  _Section 7.03_, as applicable,
the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Company

Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits that are no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Parent. 

   

 (b) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the Merger Effective Time (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall, subject to applicable Law and applicable tax qualification requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Merger Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Merger Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company employee benefit plan in which such Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits.

    ##### 

  

    

deferred arrangement intended to qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code (a "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ "). If the Company is required to terminate any Company
401(k) Plan, then the Company shall provide to Parent prior to the Closing
Date written evidence of the adoption by the Company Board of resolutions
authorizing the termination of such Company 401(k) Plan (the form
and substance of which resolutions shall be subject to the prior review and
approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). 

   

 (e) This _Section 7.04_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 7.04_, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 7.04_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this  _Section 7.04_ will create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, director or consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter. Nothing in this _Section 7.04_ is intended to amend any Plan or any employee benefit plan, agreement or arrangement of Parent, or interfere with Parents, the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys right, as applicable, from and after the Closing to amend or terminate any Plan, or any employee benefit plan, agreement or arrangement of Parent or the employment of, or provision of services by, any director, employee, independent contractor or consultant.

hold harmless such employees or agents set forth in _Section 7.06(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to
the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law without regard
to whether indemnification may be available to such Indemnified Party from
another Person, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim
and any judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including
all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with
or in respect of such judgments, fines, penalties or amounts paid in
settlement) resulting therefrom and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within

incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights
with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case, without
the requirement of any bond or other security; provided that the Person to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled to
indemnification. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section 7.06(a)_ shall
extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Merger Effective Time
and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or
omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the

personal and legal representatives. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any actual or threatened Action in respect of which indemnification has
been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder unless

such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Action or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and MergerCo agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Merger Effective Time now existing in favor of any current or former (i) director or officer of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (ii) director, officer or trustee of another entity (but only to the extent that such person is or was serving in such capacity at the request of the Company) or (iii) an employee or agent

None of the Company, Parent or MergerCo may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 8.01_, _Section 8.02 _or  _Section 8.03_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such partys failure to act in good faith or to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject to  _Section 7.07_. 

   

ARTICLE IX

 (c) by either Parent or the Company if any Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling or taken any other action (including the failure to have taken an action) which, in either such case, has the effect of making consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger (" _Governmental Order_ "), which Governmental Order shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the terms of this _Section 9.01(c)_ shall not be available to any party unless such party shall have used its reasonable best efforts to oppose any such Governmental Order or to have such Governmental Order vacated or made inapplicable to the Merger; 

   

 (d) by either Parent or the Company if the Company Stockholder Approval shall not have been obtained at the Company Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.01(d)_ shall not be available to the Company where the failure to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval is caused by any action or failure to act of the Company that constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

Company, Parent and MergerCo to proceed with the transactions contemplated
herein on such adjusted terms, (iv) after taking into account any such
adjustments, the Company Board determines in good faith that the Company
Superior Proposal described in the Superior Proposal Notice continues to

amendment, supplement or modification to the financial terms or other
material terms of any Company Superior Proposal shall be deemed a new Company

to this _Section 9.01(f)_ unless the Company has complied with
the requirements of this _Section 9.01(f)_ with respect to such new Company
Superior Proposal, including sending a Superior Proposal Notice with respect
to such new Company Superior Proposal and offering to negotiate for a three
(3) Business Day period from the delivery of such new Superior Proposal

 (f) Each of Parent, MergerCo and the Company shall bear its own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except that Parent and the Company shall each bear and pay one-half of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with filings and submissions under the HSR Act and the filing, printing and mailing of the Proxy Statement.

 Section 10.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy or the application of this Agreement to any person or circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. To such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

 Section 10.05 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the Disclosure Schedules and the Exhibits hereto, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise). 

   

 Section 10.06 _Performance Guaranty_. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the obligations covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of each of the Buyer Parties under this agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement including any such obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings that are required to be performed, discharged or complied with following the Merger Effective Time.

Subject to _Section 9.03(e)_, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and accordingly, the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms of this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. 

   

 Section 10.08 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit

 (b) Except as set out below, each of the Company, Parent and MergerCo hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or any court of the United States located in the State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum.

Service made pursuant to (i) or (ii) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of Delaware. For purposes of implementing the parties agreement to appoint and maintain an agent for service of process in the State of Delaware, each of Parent and MergerCo does hereby appoint CT Corporation as such agent and the Company does hereby appoint Corporation Service Corporation as such agent.

 Section 10.11 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 10.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

   

 Section 10.13 _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder. 

     ##### 

  

     

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, MergerCo, and the Company have caused this Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
