agreements relating to the Property. As used  herein the term "Environmental

PRICE   Section 3.1 The Purchase Price.   (a) The Purchase Price for the
Acquired Assets shall consist of the Stock Consideration, the Immediately
Available Consideration and the Escrow Consideration. The Stock Consideration
shall be paid by delivery at the Closing to Spectrian of a stock certificate
evidencing the Stock Consideration. The Immediately Available Consideration
shall be paid either (a) by wire transfer to an account designated by
Spectrian of $30 million in immediately available, freely transferable,
cleared funds at the Closing, or (b) by delivery at the Closing to Spectrian
of a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to (x) $30 million divided
by (y) the average closing price of a share of Parent Common Stock on the
NASDAQ National Market for the five (5) consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the Closing Date which shares may then be sold by Spectrian through
a registered market maker designated by Parent (and whose commission shall be
paid by Parent) within five (5) Business Days of the Closing; provided,
however, that in the event Spectrian elects to sell such shares during the
five (5) Business Day period referred to above and the aggregate proceeds of
such sale are less than $30 million, Parent agrees that it shall pay the
difference (which amount shall be prorated on a basis consistent with the
percentage of such shares actually sold) in immediately available, freely
transferable, cleared funds by wire transfer to an account designated
by Spectrian within six (6) business days of the Closing. The Escrow
Consideration shall be paid by delivery at the Closing to the Escrow Agent of
a stock certificate evidencing the Escrow Consideration.   (b) If, between
the date of this Agreement and the Closing, the shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be changed into a different number or class of shares by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, spin-off, stock-split,
combination, exchange of shares or readjustment or other similar transaction
involving Parent or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record
date within said period, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be
issued to Spectrian pursuant to Section 3.1(a) shall be appropriately and
proportionately adjusted. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall, and
shall cause their Affiliates to, use all reasonable efforts to cause the
issuance of the Parent Common Stock to be exempt from registration under
applicable federal and state securities laws by filing as soon as practicable
an application with the Secretary of State of the State of North Carolina
pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. Section 78A-30 requesting a hearing upon the
terms and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
held as soon as practicable after the filing of such application and
taking all actions necessary or appropriate to comply with the requirements
set forth therein. None of the parties to this Agreement shall make at such
hearing, or include in any information supplied with such application or
distributed at such hearing, any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.   (c) Spectrian shall prepare and use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver within 10 business days after the
Closing an unaudited balance sheet for the Business as of the Closing Date
(the "Unaudited Closing Balance Sheet") to Parent for review and comment,
prepared on the same basis as the unaudited stub period balance sheet as of
October 1, 2000    14  16  delivered by Spectrian to Parent prior to the
date of this Agreement and attached hereto in Schedule 5.4. In addition,
Spectrian shall cause PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to prepare and deliver to
Spectrian within 45 days after the Closing Date an audited balance sheet for
the Business as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet")
prepared on the same basis as the unaudited balance sheet as of October 1,
2000. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shall allow Parent\'s auditors to review the
workpapers at least five (5) business days prior to delivery of the Closing
Date Balance Sheet. If the amount of the UltraRF Net Assets as of the Closing
Date (which shall be calculated based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet) is
less than the amount of the UltraRF Net Assets as of October 1, 2000, then
Spectrian shall pay to Newco, promptly but within 10 days after delivery of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, an amount equal to such difference in
immediately available, freely transferable, cleared funds by wire transfer to
an account designated by Newco. If the amount of the UltraRF Net Assets as of
October 1, 2000 is less than the UltraRF Net Assets as of the Closing Date
(which shall be calculated based on the Closing Date Balance Sheet), then
Newco shall (and Parent shall cause Newco to) pay to Spectrian, promptly but
within 10 days after delivery of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, an amount
equal to such difference in immediately available, freely
transferable, cleared funds by wire transfer to an account designated by
Spectrian.   In addition, Spectrian agrees to disburse funds for the
trade accounts payable on behalf of Newco for the 45 days immediately
following the Closing Date. Spectrian shall provide Newco with schedules
setting forth all such disbursements made 15 days after the Closing Date, 30
days after the Closing Date and 45 days after the Closing Date. Newco agrees
to fully reimburse Spectrian within five (5) days of receipt of each
schedule, provided, however, after receipt of the Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the schedule setting forth the funds disbursed by Spectrian on Newco\'s
behalf during the 45 days after the Closing Date, Newco and Spectrian agree
that Newco shall reimburse Spectrian for the amount of such trade accounts
payable net the external accounts receivable set forth in the Closing Date
Balance Sheet (whether collected or not); provided, further, all accounts
receivable set forth in the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be collected and
remitted to Spectrian for Spectrian\'s benefit whether collected by Spectrian
or Parent; provided, further, this paragraph shall specifically supercede
Section 2.2(a)(viii).   ARTICLE 4  THE CLOSING   Section 4.1 Closing

assumption of the Assumed Liabilities (hereinafter called the "Closing")

hereunder will not result in any obligation or liability (with respect to
accrued benefits or otherwise) of Newco to any Transferred Employee, any
employee or former employee of any plan or the PBGC. No amendment to,
termination of, or withdrawal from, any Spectrian Benefit Plan (subject to

investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Business or the Facility pending and Spectrian has not received any written
notice since January 1, 2000 that any such investigation or review is

Spectrian\'s standard forms.   (g) No claims have been asserted nor, to
Spectrian\'s knowledge, have any such claims been threatened by any person

any other Person or (ii) against the use by Spectrian of any Intellectual
Property used in or necessary for the conduct of the Business as now

Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of each their Subsidiaries, as

reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Closing to all the properties, books, contracts, commitments,

any information being provided to it or its representatives by Spectrian
pursuant to this Agreement is subject to the terms of a confidentiality
agreement between Parent and Spectrian, dated October 5, 2000, (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), which terms are incorporated herein

expense, Parent shall cause Newco to (i) preserve and keep the books,
contracts, commitments and records included in the Acquired Assets for a
period of not less than seven (7) years from the Closing Date, or for any
longer periods as may be required by any Governmental Entity or as may be
made prudent by the circumstances of any ongoing audit or litigation, and
(ii) provide Spectrian with reasonable access to the foregoing

requirement. Parent or Spectrian shall have the right, at its own expense, to
seek confidential treatment of any information to be so disclosed.   Section

to take all commercially reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with
all legal requirements which may be imposed on it with respect to the Closing

and to satisfy all applicable conditions to Closing and consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and

conditions of employment, including employee benefit plans, provided to
employees of Parent as of the date hereof. Each Spectrian Employee who
accepts an offer of employment from Newco effective as of the Closing shall

applicable plan of Spectrian or any of its subsidiaries).   (c) Newco shall
provide continuation health care coverage to all Transferred Employees and
their qualified beneficiaries who incur a "qualifying event" after the
Closing Date in accordance with and to the extent required, under the
continuation health care coverage requirements of Section 4980D of the Code
and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA ("COBRA"). Spectrian shall be

"plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act), affecting
Transferred Employees and occurring on or after the Closing Date. Newco shall
indemnify and hold harmless Spectrian and its Affiliates with respect to any
liability under the WARN Act arising from the actions of Newco or its
Affiliates on or after the Closing Date.   Section 7.6 Tax Matters.   (a)
All real property, personal property and ad valorem taxes that are
attributable to the Acquired Assets shall be apportioned and prorated between

rates for the then current year have not been published, then the
proration of real and personal property taxes shall be made on the basis of
the tax rate for the preceding tax year applied to the latest assessed
valuation of the Acquired Assets, and when the tax rate is fixed for the tax
year in which the Closing occurs, Spectrian and Newco agree to adjust such
prorations and, if necessary, to refund or pay such sums to the other party
as necessary to effect such readjustment.   (b) Subject to the provisions
of Section 7.2 of this Agreement, Newco and Spectrian each agrees that it
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, (i) make available all such
information, employees and records of or relating to the Business or the
Acquired Assets to the other party and its employees and advisors as the
other party may reasonably request with respect to matters relating to Taxes
(including, without limitation, Tax Returns, Tax compliance packages and any
other relevant information collected in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns and/or reports relating to Taxes), (ii) provide to the other party
copies of such information and records as the other party may reasonably
request, and (iii) cooperate as reasonably requested by the other party with
respect to all matters relating to Taxes (including, without limitation, the
preparation of Tax compliance packages, the filing of Tax Returns, the filing
of any amended Tax Return if reasonably requested by the other party, audits,
and proceedings).   (c) Subject to the provisions of Section 10 of this
Agreement, Spectrian shall indemnify and hold Newco harmless against all
Taxes relating to the Business or the Acquired Assets for Pre-Closing
Periods; provided, however, that in the event that a Tax matter arises
that    29  31  could give rise to liability of Spectrian pursuant to
this Section 7.6(c), Newco shall promptly provide written notice thereof to
Spectrian, Spectrian, at its option and expense, shall control all actions
taken in connection with such Tax matter, and neither Parent nor Newco shall
agree to or settle such Tax matter without Spectrian\'s prior written
consent. Any Tax refunds relating to the Business or the Acquired Assets for
Pre-Closing Periods that are received by Newco, and any amounts credited
against any Tax to which Newco becomes entitled that relate to Pre-Closing
Periods or are attributable to any adjustment by a Taxing Authority to
Taxable income, loss or Tax liability for Pre-Closing Periods, shall be for
the account of Spectrian. Newco shall pay over to Spectrian any such refund
or the amount of any such credit within five (5) business days after the
earlier of the receipt thereof by Newco in the case of a refund or, in the
case of a credit, within five (5) business days of the due date of the Tax
Return for the Tax to which the credit is applied.   (d) Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, all transfer, registration, stamp,
documentary, sales, use and similar Taxes (including, but not limited to, all
applicable real estate transfer or gains Taxes) incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be the
responsibility of and be paid by Spectrian. The parties shall cooperate in
the timely making of all filings, Tax Returns, reports and forms as may be
required in connection therewith. At the Closing, Spectrian and Newco shall
deliver to each other such properly completed resale exemption certificates
and other similar certificates or instruments as are necessary to claim
available exemptions from the payment of sales, transfer, use or other
similar Taxes under applicable law.   (e) If Newco or Spectrian or either of
their Affiliates receives any written notice from any Taxing Authority
proposing any adjustment that could affect the liability of the other party
under this Agreement for any Tax relating to the Business or the Acquired
Assets, such party shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other
party, which notice shall describe in detail each proposed adjustment.  
(f) The "consideration" (within the meaning of Code Section 1060) paid by
Newco pursuant to the terms hereof shall be allocated among the assets
acquired by Newco hereunder in the manner required by Code Section 1060 and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Newco shall prepare and deliver
a schedule setting forth the fair market value of the assets and the amount
of the liabilities taken into account under Treasury Regulations sections
1.1060-1T, 1.338-4T, -5T and -6T for review and comment by Spectrian within
thirty (30) days after the Closing Date, and Spectrian shall be deemed to
have accepted such determination unless Spectrian notifies Newco in writing
of an objection within thirty (30) days after receipt of Newco\'s schedule.
If Spectrian gives such notice of objection to Newco\'s schedule, and if
Newco and Spectrian are unable to resolve such objection through commercially
reasonable efforts within thirty (30) days of Newco\'s receipt of
Spectrian\'s notice, then the objection shall be submitted to and reviewed by
an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants mutually
chosen and jointly engaged by Newco and Spectrian (the "Resolution CPA
Firm"), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Newco and
Spectrian. In connection with the foregoing, Newco and Spectrian shall make
readily available to the Resolution CPA Firm all relevant items reasonably
requested by the Resolution CPA Firm. Further, Newco and Spectrian shall
instruct the Resolution CPA Firm to deliver its written determination
to Newco and Spectrian no later than thirty (30) days after the matter is
referred to    30  32  the Resolution CPA Firm. The fees and expenses
of the Resolution CPA Firm shall be borne equally by Newco and Spectrian.
Newco and Spectrian agree that (i) Newco and Spectrian shall file with their
respective federal income Tax Returns (and applicable foreign, state and
local Tax Returns) consistent IRS Forms 8594 (and comparable foreign, state
and local forms), including any required amendments thereto, which shall
reflect the allocation determined in accordance herewith, and (ii) such
allocation (subject to appropriate adjustments to reflect any subsequent
change in the consideration hereunder) shall be binding on Newco and
Spectrian for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes.   (g)
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the covenants
contained in Section 7.6 (relating to Taxes) shall survive indefinitely.  
Section 7.7 Expenses. Whether or not the Closing occurs and except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses. Any finders\'
or investment banking fee due by Spectrian in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by Spectrian directly,
and not out of the Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other
provisions of this Agreement, Newco and Spectrian agree that all fees
incurred in connection with any filing made pursuant to the HSR Act shall be
paid by Newco or Parent.   Section 7.8 Financial Information. Subject to the
provisions of Section 7.2 and 7.6(b) and after the Closing, upon reasonable
written notice, Newco and Spectrian shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other and their respective accountants, counsel and other
representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours, to such
information (including records pertinent to the Business) and assistance
relating to the Business as is reasonably necessary for financial reporting
and accounting matters, the preparation and filing of any returns, reports or
forms or the defense of any Tax audit, proceeding, claim or assessment.  
Section 7.9 Bulk Transfer Laws. Newco hereby waives compliance by Spectrian
with the provisions of any so-called "bulk transfer law" (including, without
limitation, bulk transfer laws relating to Taxes) of any jurisdiction
in connection with the sale of the Acquired Assets to Newco. Spectrian
shall indemnify and hold harmless Newco against any and all liabilities,
including applicable interest and penalties, that may be asserted by third
parties (including any Taxing Authority) against Newco as a result of
noncompliance with any such bulk transfer law.   Section 7.10 Actions of
Newco and Spectrian. Neither party shall knowingly take any action that would
reasonably be expected to result in any of the representations or warranties
made by such party in the Transaction Agreements becoming untrue in any
material respect or in any of the conditions of the Closing set forth in
Article VIII not being satisfied.   Section 7.11 No Additional
Representations. Newco acknowledges that it and its representatives have been
permitted full and complete access to the Acquired Assets that it and its
representatives have desired or requested to see or review, and that its
representatives have had a full opportunity to meet with Spectrian and

Business. Newco acknowledges that it and its representatives have received or
have had an opportunity to review prior to the date hereof all written
materials which Spectrian is required to deliver or make available, as the

any other person will be subject to any liability to Newco or any other

neither Parent, Newco nor any other person has made any representation or
warranty, express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any
information regarding the business of either Parent or Newco except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the schedules attached hereto, and
that neither Parent, Newco nor any other person will be subject to any
liability to Spectrian or any other person resulting from the distribution to

objections which may be raised by the FTC, DOJ or any Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over antitrust matters. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if Spectrian, in its reasonable
business judgment, considers the imposition of a condition upon the
transactions by a Governmental Entity to be materially adverse to Spectrian

conditions substantially similar to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Lease (as defined below) which are applicable to the Facility; provided,
however, the parties agree that the economic terms and conditions which are

acceptable to SPEC, Spectrian and Newco.   Section 7.14 Delivery of Audited

directly or indirectly engage in the business of developing, manufacturing
and supplying radio frequency power semiconductors in the Semiconductor Field
(the "Competing Business"). For purposes of this Section 7.17, Spectrian
shall be deemed to engage in a business if it, directly or indirectly,
engages or invests in, owns, manages, operates, controls or participates in
the ownership, management, operation or control of, or renders services or
advice to, any business engaged in the Business; provided, however, that
Spectrian may invest in the securities of any enterprise (but

have been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and (ii) Spectrian does not beneficially own (as defined Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) in excess of 5% of the
outstanding equity of such enterprise. The foregoing shall not prevent
Spectrian from either (A) working with venders of semiconductor components to
develop such components for use in amplifiers and amplifier subsystems
manufactured by Spectrian, or (B) being acquired by a company or a
subsidiary, division or business unit of a company (each, a "Separate Unit")
where the Separate Unit itself is not engaged in the Competing Business and
where Spectrian has no business relationship with any other parts of the
company that are engaged in the Competing    33  35  Business and where
Spectrian is not involved, directly or indirectly, in any part of the
company\'s (or any other Separate Unit\'s) Competing Business activities.  
(b) During the same period as the restrictions of paragraph (a) above shall
apply, neither Spectrian, Parent or Newco shall (i) request, induce or
attempt to influence any distributor or supplier of goods or services to any
other party to curtail or cancel any business they may transact with

consent of Parent) sell into the public markets in excess of 25,000 shares of
Parent Common Stock during any one business day. Spectrian agrees that during
the next 55 days, it shall not sell into the public markets in excess of
75,000 shares of Parent Common Stock during any one (1) business day, nor
shall it sell more than an aggregate of 300,000 shares of Parent Common Stock
during any one (1) calendar week. In addition, Spectrian agrees that it shall
make all public sales of Parent Common Stock through a registered market
maker and otherwise in accordance with Rule 145 under the Securities Act.
This Section 7.18 shall not apply to the Immediately
Available Consideration.   Section 7.19 Exclusivity. From the date hereof
until the earlier of the Closing Date or such time as this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article 9 herein, Spectrian agrees that it will not,
and will cause its affiliates, directors, officers, employees and
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
encourage, discuss, negotiate, entertain or accept any inquiries, proposals
or offers (whether initiated by them or otherwise) with respect to (A) the
acquisition of any shares of capital stock or any other voting securities or
debt securities of the Business or Spectrian or any interest therein, (B) the
acquisition of all or a material portion of the assets and properties of the
Business or Spectrian or any interest therein (C) the merger, consolidation
or combination of the Business or Spectrian, (D) the liquidation, dissolution
or reorganization of the Business or Spectrian (each of the foregoing, a
"Potential Transaction"), (ii) provide information relating to the Business
in connection with a Potential Transaction or (iii) enter into any contract,
agreement arrangement or understanding concerning or relating to a Potential
Transaction, in each case with a third party other than Parent. In the event
that Spectrian or the Business, or any of their respective
affiliates, directors, officers, employees or representatives, receives an
unsolicited inquiry, proposal or offer with respect to a Potential
Transaction or obtains information that such an inquiry, proposal or offer is
likely to be made, Spectrian or the Business or such affiliate director
officer employee or representative, will provide Parent with immediate notice
thereof, subject to the confidentiality provisions contained herein, which
notice shall include the terms of and the identity of the person or persons
making such inquiry proposal or offer; provided, however, that Spectrian
shall not be subject to this paragraph to the extent a Potential Transaction
involves Spectrian alone and does not    34  36  contemplate the
inclusion of the Business unless such Potential Transaction would impair or
otherwise affect the consummation of the Acquisition.   Section 7.20
Registration Rights. In the event the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to this Agreement (the "Registrable Securities") do not become
exempt from registration under applicable federal and state laws for any
reason prior to the Closing Date, Parent hereby agrees to enter into
a Registration Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto.   Section 7.21
Parent\'s Investigation Period.   (a) As used herein, the term "Parent\'s
Investigation Period" shall mean the period commencing on the date hereof and
ending on the Closing Date. As used herein, the term "Parent\'s
Investigation" shall mean Parent\'s right, prior to the expiration of the
Parent\'s Investigation Period and at Parent\'s sole expense, to conduct any
inspections and investigations reasonably requested by Parent with respect to
the physical or environmental condition of the Facility or the Acquired
Assets (collectively referred to hereinafter from time to time as the
"Property") as shall be deemed desirable by Parent, including conducting and
taking studies, surveys, tests (including specifically soil and/or
groundwater testing), sampling and borings on or under the
Property (including without limitation the performance of Phase I and Phase
II environmental audits of the Property).   (b) Parent, its agents,
employees, contractors or other representatives, shall have the rights of
access to the Property at all reasonable times during the Parent\'s
Investigation Period for the purpose of conducting any and all above-
referenced inspections and investigations. Spectrian hereby agrees to
cooperate with and assist Parent in inspecting and investigating the Property
during Parent\'s Investigation Period. Within three (3) business days of the
date hereof, Spectrian shall deliver to Parent copies of all surveys,
engineering reports, appraisals, environmental audits, construction documents
(including without limitation all related plans and specifications),
governmental permits, access agreements, and utility agreements, if any,
relating to the Property in Spectrian\'s possession, as well as any other

(c) Parent shall be responsible for the management and disposal of any
investigation-derived waste (including, without limitation, drill cuttings
and purge water), and shall properly close all soil borings and groundwater
wells in compliance with all applicable requirements of law. Parent shall
provide Spectrian split samples from each sampling point properly
packaged and preserved and copies of all sampling logs and related
information necessary for independent analysis of such samples by
Spectrian.   (d) Except to the extent caused by the negligence
or misconduct of Spectrian, its Affiliates, employees, contractors or
agents, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Spectrian and all of its
officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents (the "Indemnified
Parties") from and against all damages to the Property (and all improvements
and personal property thereon) caused by the Parent\'s Investigation, and
Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and
against any and all liability, cost and expense (including, without
limitation, attorneys\' fees and expenses of any of the Indemnified Parties)
arising from the handling, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of
samples of    35  37  environmental media generated in connection with
the Parent\'s Investigation. This Section 7.21(d) shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and shall be subject to the indemnification
procedures set forth in Article 10.   (e) Parent shall provide Spectrian
with copies of all reports (including, without limitation, analysis results)
prepared in connection with the Parent\'s Investigation. Parent shall use any
reports prepared or information generated in connection with the Parent\'s
Investigation solely in connection with the transactions contemplated by
Parent and Spectrian, and Parent shall not disclose or permit the disclosure
of such reports or information to any person (other than agents and
representatives of Parent and Newco which persons shall be subject to
confidentiality agreements) for any reason at any time; provided, however,
that, after providing written notice thereof to Spectrian, Parent
may disclose such reports or information as required by law or court order.
This Section 7.21(e) shall survive the termination of this Agreement.   (f)
In the event Parent\'s investigation identifies any Environmental Condition
that would constitute a breach by Spectrian of Section 5.18 herein, then
Parent shall have the right to give written notice thereof to Spectrian and
elect to terminate this Agreement. If Parent provides such notice to
Spectrian and does not elect to terminate, Spectrian may either (i) cure
any problems or defects noted by Parent (at Spectrian\'s sole cost and
expense), (ii) provide for the cure of any such problems or defects (at
Spectrian\'s sole cost and expense), or (iii) refuse to cure any such
problems or defects. In the event Spectrian elects to cure, or provide for
the cure, of any such noted problems or defects, Spectrian shall so notify
Parent of such election within 10 business days of Spectrian\'s receipt of
such notice. If Spectrian (i) elects not to cure said problems or defects, or
provide for the cure of said problems or defects, or (ii) fails to timely
notify Parent of such election, or (iii) fails for any reason to cure said
problems or defects within a mutually agreed upon cure period, then Parent
shall have the option of either accepting the Property in its then-present
condition or terminating this Agreement, in which case Parent shall have no
further obligations hereunder, except as may otherwise be
provided herein.   (g) Neither Parent\'s performance of any additional
due diligence activities hereunder nor anything else contained in this
Section 7.21 shall diminish, waive or have any impact or effect on the
warranties and representations of Spectrian contained herein, or on any
rights or remedies to which Parent or Newco may be entitled hereunder.

ARTICLE 10  INDEMNIFICATION   Section 10.1 Indemnification by
Spectrian.   (a) Spectrian hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold Parent, Newco and its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors and employees (the "Newco Indemnified Parties") against, and agrees
to hold them harmless from, any Loss to the extent such Loss arises from or
in connection with:   (i) any breach by Spectrian of any  representation
or warranty contained in this  Agreement or any other agreement or 
documents delivered in connection herewith;   (ii) any breach by Spectrian
of any of its  covenants contained in this Agreement; or   (iii) any
Excluded Liability.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnification
in favor of the Newco Indemnified Parties contained in this Section 10.1 (i)
shall not be effective until the aggregate dollar amount of all Losses
indemnified against under this Section 10.1 exceeds one (1) half of one (1)
percent (0.5%) of the Purchase Price ("Spectrian\'s Threshold Amount"), and
then only to the extent such aggregate amount exceeds Spectrian\'s Threshold
Amount; and (ii) shall terminate once the aggregate dollar amount of all
Losses indemnified against under this Section 10.1 aggregates 25% of the
Purchase Price ("Spectrian\'s Cap Amount"), and Spectrian shall thereafter
have no further obligations or liabilities with respect to any of such
losses; provided, however,    40  42  that in the event there are
Losses asserted against, imposed upon or incurred by the Newco Indemnified
Parties resulting from breaches of Sections 5.13, 5.18, 5.20, 7.6 or 7.21 of
this Agreement, there shall be no Spectrian Threshold Amount and Spectrian\'s
Cap Amount shall be unlimited, with respect to Losses asserted against,
imposed upon or incurred by the Newco Indemnified Parties resulting from
breaches of Sections 5.13, 5.18, 5.20, 7.6 and 7.21 of this Agreement, only;
provided, further, that the foregoing limitations on Spectrian\'s
indemnification obligations pursuant to this Section 10.1 shall not apply to
any indemnification by Spectrian for any Losses asserted against, imposed
upon or incurred by the Newco Indemnified Parties resulting from any Excluded
Liability or from fraud or willful misconduct.   (c) Parent, Newco and
Spectrian acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this Section 10.1 (with respect to Parent and Newco) and Section 10.2 (with
respect to Spectrian). In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and Newco
hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and
all rights, claims and causes of action each may have against Spectrian
arising under or based upon any Governmental Rule; provided,
however, Spectrian acknowledges that money damages would not be sufficient or
adequate remedy for any breach or violation of, or default under Section
7.17, 7.19 or 9.1(c) of this Agreement, and Spectrian agrees that with
respect to Section 7.17, 7.19 or 9.1(c) of this Agreement Parent shall be
entitled to the fullest extent permitted by law to an injunction restraining
such breach, violation or default or threatened breach, violation or default
and to any other equitable relief, including, without limitation, specific
performance.   (d) Amounts payable to Parent for indemnification claims
under this Section 10.1 shall first be paid from the escrow account under the
Escrow Agreement. To the extent the foregoing is not sufficient to pay such
claim, such claim shall be paid by Spectrian.   Section 10.2
Indemnification by Parent and Newco.   (a) Newco and Parent hereby agree to
indemnify Spectrian and its Affiliates and their respective officers,
directors and employees (the "Spectrian Indemnified Parties") against, and
agrees to hold them harmless from, any Loss to the extent such Loss arises
from or in connection with:   (i) any breach by Newco or Parent of any 
representation or warranty contained in this  Agreement or any other
agreement or document  (other than the Purchase and Supply  Agreement)
delivered in connection herewith;   (ii) any breach by Newco or Parent of
any  covenant contained in this Agreement;   (iii) the operation of the
Business after the  Closing Date; or   (iv) any Assumed Liability.   (b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnification in favor of the Spectrian
Indemnified Parties contained in this Section 10.2 (i) shall not be effective
until the aggregate    41  43  dollar amount of all Losses indemnified
against under this Section 10.2 exceeds one (1) half of one (1) percent
(0.5%) of the Purchase Price ("Parent\'s Threshold Amount"), and then only to
the extent such aggregate amount exceeds Parent\'s Threshold Amount; and (ii)
shall terminate once the aggregate dollar amount of all Losses indemnified
against under this Section 10.2 aggregates 25% of the Purchase Price, and
Parent shall thereafter have no further obligations or liabilities with
respect to any of such losses   Section 10.3 Losses Net of Insurance, etc.
The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided under this
Article 10 shall be net of any actual cash insurance recoveries or recoveries
of indemnities from any third parties. Neither party shall have an obligation
to seek an insurance recovery or third party indemnification and if a party
does so and obtains a recovery, the party\'s indemnity claim shall not be
offset to the extent of the party\'s expenses in obtaining such recovery and
an amount equal to anticipated premium increases for the following three (3)
years.   Section 10.4 Termination of Indemnification. The obligations
to indemnify and hold harmless any party, (a) pursuant to Sections 10.1(a)(i)
and 10.2(a), shall terminate when the applicable representation or
warranty terminates pursuant to Section 11.3, and (b) pursuant to the other
clauses of Sections 10.1 and 10.2 shall not terminate.   Section 10.5
Procedure.   (a) For an indemnified party (the "indemnified party") to
be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this Agreement,
such indemnified party shall, following the discovery of the matters giving
rise to any Loss, notify the indemnifying party (the "indemnifying party") in
writing of its claim for indemnification for such Loss, specifying in
reasonable detail the nature of such Loss and the amount of the liability
estimated to accrue therefrom; provided, however, that failure to give such
notification shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually prejudiced as a
result of such failure (except that the indemnifying party shall not be
liable for any expenses incurred during the period in which the indemnified
party failed to give such notice). Thereafter, the indemnified party shall
deliver to the indemnifying party, within five business days after the
indemnified party\'s receipt of such notice, all information and
documentation reasonably requested by the indemnifying party with respect to
such Loss.   (b) If the indemnification sought pursuant hereto involves
a claim made by a third party against the indemnified party (a "Third
Party Claim"), the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim and, if it so chooses, to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the indemnifying
party. Should the indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the
indemnified party for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If the indemnifying
party assumes such defense, the indemnified party shall have the right to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it being
understood that the indemnifying party shall control such defense. The
indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the
indemnifying party has not assumed the    42  44  defense thereof (other
than during any period in which the indemnified party shall have failed to
give notice of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the indemnifying
party chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim, all of the parties
hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying
party\'s request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. If
the indemnifying party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim,
the indemnified party will agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge
of such Third Party Claim which the indemnifying party may recommend and
which by its terms obligates the indemnifying party to pay the full amount of
the liability in connection with such Third Party Claim. Whether or not the
indemnifying party shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
indemnified party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the indemnifying
party\'s prior written consent.   ARTICLE 11  GENERAL PROVISIONS
