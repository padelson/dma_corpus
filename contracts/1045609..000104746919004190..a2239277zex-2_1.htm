Tax other than (A) in the ordinary course of business consistent with past

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any manager, director, officer, trustee, agent, fiduciary, advisor or Person acting in a similar capacity may have under any indemnification agreement, the Company Advisory Agreement or under the Organizational Documents of Company or any Company Subsidiary, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof, was previously, or during the period from the date hereof through the Closing Date, serving as a manager, director, officer, trustee, agent, fiduciary, advisor or Person acting in a similar capacity of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and acting in such capacity (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, including without limitation Section 2-418 of the MGCL, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Claim Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) relating to or resulting from such Claim; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within ten (10) Business Days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Claim Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Claim Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security, but subject to Parent\'s receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party to repay such Claim Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified; _provided_ that Parent shall not be liable for any amounts paid in settlement effected without Parent\'s prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.5(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to be a manager, director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, fiduciary, advisor or Person acting in a similar capacity of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit of such Person\'s heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives. As used in this _Section 7.5(a)_, (I) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, whether instituted by any Party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to, or that any Indemnified Party reasonably believes could lead to the institution of any Action arising out of or pertaining to, (x) matters that relate to such Indemnified Party\'s duties or service as a manager, director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, fiduciary, advisor or Person acting in a similar capacity of Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or, to the extent such 

  

      

  

Person is or was serving at the request or for the benefit of Company or any

investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including
on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or
participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to
this _Section 7.5(a)_, including any Action relating to a claim for
indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. Parent shall
not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any actual
or threatened Claim in respect of which indemnification has been sought by an
Indemnified Party hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Claim, or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents

 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance (including any Side A component thereof) covering each Person currently covered by Company\'s directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to and through the Closing; _provided_ that in lieu of Parent\'s obligation hereunder, (i) Parent may substitute therefor policies of an insurance company with the same or better rating as Company\'s or the applicable Company Subsidiary\'s current insurance carrier the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than Company\'s or the applicable Company Subsidiary\'s existing policies as of the date hereof and which substitute policies are reasonably acceptable to Company, or (ii) Company may obtain extended reporting period coverage under Company\'s or the applicable Company Subsidiary\'s existing insurance programs (to be effective as of the Closing) or purchase a "tail" policy for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, as applicable, for a cost not in excess of two and a half (2.5) times the current annual premiums for such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to pay annual premiums for insurance under this _Section 7.5(c)_ in excess of 250% of the most recent annual premiums paid by Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary, as applicable, prior to the date of this Agreement for such purpose, it being understood that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 250% amount. 

  

      

                                    

   

  

 (d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or other entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) liquidates, dissolves or winds-up, or transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_. 

  

 (e) Parent shall pay all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 7.5_; _provided_ that such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such Person is not legally entitled to indemnification under Law. 

  

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 7.5_ are intended to be for the express benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party (who are intended third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_), his or her heirs and his or her personal representatives, shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, Company and the Surviving Entity and shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to the Indemnified Party (including his or her successors, assigns and heirs) without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (including such successors, assigns and heirs) affected thereby. The exculpation and indemnification provided for by this _Section 7.5_ shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to applicable Law, contract or otherwise.

any fraud in connection with this Agreement or any willful and material
breach of any of its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement prior
to such termination of this Agreement, in which case the aggrieved party
hereto shall be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in
equity, including in the case of a breach by Parent or Merger Sub, liability
to Company for damages, determined taking into account all relevant factors,

and material breach_ " means a material breach that is a consequence of an
act undertaken, or failure to act, by the breaching Party with the actual
knowledge that such act or failure to act constitutes or would result in a
breach of this Agreement (regardless of whether breaching was the intent or
object of such act or failure to act and it being understood that the failure
of Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, to
consummate the Merger when required under the terms of this Agreement (e.g.,
all of the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ have
been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived (other than
conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing) and the
other Party(ies) stood ready, willing and able to consummate the Merger at
such time) will constitute a willful and material breach).

  

 Section 9.3 _ Fees and Expenses._

 (i) (A)(1) this Agreement is terminated by either Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(i)_, and after the date hereof and prior to such termination, a Company Acquisition Proposal (with, for all purposes of this _Section 9.3(b)(i) _, all percentages included in the definition of " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " increased to 50%) has been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to the Company Board or (2) this Agreement is terminated by Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(b)(iii)_, and prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting, a Company Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or otherwise communicated to Company\'s stockholders, and (B) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination, a transaction in respect of a Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated or Company enters into a Company Alternative Acquisition Agreement that is later consummated; 

  

 (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)(ii)_; or 

   

 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by Company pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)(ii)_; 

  

then, in any such event, Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination
Fee, it being understood that in no event shall Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. Payment of the Company
Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to the
account or accounts designated by Parent (x) at the time of consummation of
any transaction contemplated by a Company Acquisition Proposal, in the case
of a Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(i)_, (y) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event,
within two (2) Business Days thereof), in the case of a Company Termination
Fee payable pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)(ii) _, and (z) substantially
concurrently with such termination, in the case of a Company Termination Fee
payable pursuant to  _Section 9.3(b)(iii)_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in the event that the Company Termination Fee
becomes payable, then payment to Parent of the Company Termination Fee,
together with any amounts due under _Section 9.3(c)_, shall be Parent\'s sole
and exclusive remedy as liquidated damages for any and all losses or

   

      

   

damages of any nature against Company, the Company Subsidiaries and each of
their respective former, current and future directors, officers, trustees,
employees, agents, general and limited partners, managers, members,
stockholders, Affiliates and assignees and each former, current or future
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, general or limited partner,
manager, member, stockholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of the foregoing
(collectively, the " _Company Parties_ ") in respect of this Agreement, any
agreement executed in connection herewith, and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including for any loss or damage suffered as a result of
the termination of this Agreement, the failure of the Merger to be
consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder (whether
intentionally, unintentionally, or otherwise) or otherwise, and upon payment
of such Company Termination Fee no Company Party shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; _provided_ that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply in the case of fraud or a willful and material
breach of this Agreement by any of the Company Parties.

    

 (c) Each of Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement. If Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due pursuant to _Section 9.3(b) _, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against Company for the amounts set forth in _Section 9.3(b)_, Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in _Sections 9.3(b)_ from the date of termination of this Agreement until the date such payment was actually made at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Accordingly, persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

  

 Section 10.6 _ Amendment._ Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties hereto by action taken or authorized by the Company Board and the Parent Board, respectively, at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and prior to the Closing; _provided_ that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or the holders of shares of Company Restricted Stock, or which by applicable Law requires the further approval of the stockholders of Company without such further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties.

Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall 

        

preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not
constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder.

   

 Section 10.8 _ Governing Law._ The filing of the Merger Certificate shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflicts of Law principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. Except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence, this Agreement, and all Actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to any choice or conflicts of Law principles (whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland. 

  

 Section 10.9 _ Consent to Jurisdiction._ Each Party irrevocably agrees and consents (a) to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (Maryland), and to request assignment to the Business and Technology Case Management Program (the " _Maryland Court_ ") for the purpose of any Action (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the Parties in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement, (b) that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) that it waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Action in the Maryland Court and agrees not to plead or claim in the Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum, (d) that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement in any court other than the Maryland Court, and (e) that a final judgment in any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to request and/or consent to the assignment of any Action to the Maryland Court\'s Business and Technology Case Management Program. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect the rights of any Party to pursue appeals from any judgments or order of the Maryland Court as provided by Law. Each Party agrees, (x) to the extent such Party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Maryland, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland as such Party\'s agent for acceptance of legal process, and (y) that service of process may also be made on such Party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made pursuant to _clauses (x)_ or _(y)_ above shall have the same legal force and effect as if served upon such Party personally within the State of Maryland.  

  

 Section 10.10 _ Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 10.11 _ Remedies._ 

  

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 9.3(b)_, _Section 10.11(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon 

  

      

  

such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude
the exercise of any other remedy.

  

 (b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached (including if any of the Parties hereto fail to take any action required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Parties\' obligations to consummate the Merger and the obligation of Parent or Merger Sub to pay, and the right of the holders of Company Common Stock and the holders of Company Restricted Stock right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement without proof of damages or otherwise (including the Parties\' obligations to consummate the Merger and the obligation of Parent or Merger Sub to pay, and the right of the holders of Company Common Stock and the holders of Company Restricted Stock to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby waives (a) any defense in an Action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. Each Party agrees that the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right neither Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, would have entered into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other equitable remedies to the extent permitted by this _Section 10.11_ and the payment of damages as contemplated by _Section 9.2_, but shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award of damages if specific performance or other equitable remedies are awarded and consummation of the Merger occurs and shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award of specific performance or other equitable remedies if damages are awarded. 

  

  

 Section 10.12 _ Waiver of Jury Trial._ EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.12. 

  

 Section 10.13 _ Authorship._ The Parties agree that the terms and language of this Agreement are the result of negotiations among the Parties and their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without regard to events of authorship or negotiation.

Re: Industrial Property Trust Inc. 
  Status as a Real Estate Investment Trust

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

 We are acting as counsel to Industrial Property Trust Inc., a Maryland corporation (the " _Company_ "), in connection with the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Rockies Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Merger Sub_ "), with and into the Company pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of July 15, 2019 and as amended from time to time, by and among the Company, Merger Sub and Prologis, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Parent_ "). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 We are providing this opinion letter to you in connection with the Merger at the request of the Company in accordance with Section 8.2(e) of the Merger Agreement. Although you may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the federal tax treatment and federal tax structure of the Company and all materials of any kind that were provided to you by us relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, this opinion is intended for your benefit, and may be relied upon by Parent, in connection with the Merger Agreement. You may not authorize any other person or entity to rely on this opinion, or otherwise make this opinion available for the benefit of any other person or entity, without our prior written consent. 

  

 In our capacity as counsel to the Company and for purposes of rendering this opinion, we have examined and relied upon the following, with your consent: (i) the Merger Agreement; (ii) a certificate executed by duly appointed officers of the Company (the " _Company Officer\'s Certificate_ ") setting forth certain factual representations, dated [ * ], 2019, and (iii) such other documents as we have considered relevant to our analysis. We have also examined the opinions, including officer\'s certificates and exhibits related thereto, of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, dated July 17, 2017 , with respect to the qualification of the Company as a real estate investment trust (" _REIT_ ") through its taxable year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, we have examined such other documents as we have considered relevant to our analysis. In our examination of such documents, we have assumed the authenticity of original documents, the accuracy of copies, the genuineness of signatures, and the legal capacity of signatories. We have also assumed that all parties to such documents have acted, and will act, in accordance with the terms of such documents. 

  

 Our opinion is based on: (a) our understanding of the facts as represented to us in the Company Officer\'s Certificate; and (b) the assumption that (i) the Company and its subsidiaries have valid legal existences under the laws of the states in which they were formed and, to the extent relevant to our opinion, have operated in accordance with the laws of such states, (ii) the Company is operated, and will continue to be operated, in the manner described in the Company Officer\'s Certificate, (iii) all representations of fact contained in the Company Officer\'s Certificate are true and complete, (iv) any representation of fact in the Company Officer\'s Certificate that is made "to the knowledge of" or similarly qualified is correct without such qualification, and (v) the Merger will be consummated in accordance with the Merger Agreement. While we have made such inquiries and investigations as we have deemed necessary, we have not undertaken an independent inquiry into or verification of all such    

facts either in the course of our representation of the Company or for the
purpose of rendering this opinion. While we have reviewed all representations
made to us to determine their reasonableness, and nothing has come to our
attention that would cause us to question the accuracy of such
representations, we have no assurance that they are or will ultimately prove
to be accurate.

  

 We note that the tax consequences addressed herein depend upon the actual occurrence of events in the future, which events may or may not be consistent with any representations made to us for purposes of this opinion. In particular, the qualification and taxation of the Company as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes depends upon the Company\'s ability to meet on a continuing basis certain distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership, and the various qualification tests imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "). To the extent that the facts differ from those represented to or assumed by us herein, our opinion should not be relied upon. 

  

 Our opinion herein is based on existing law as contained in the Code, final and temporary Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_ ") and court decisions as of the date hereof. The provisions of the Code and the Treasury Regulations, IRS administrative pronouncements and case law upon which this opinion is based could be changed at any time, perhaps with retroactive effect. In addition, some of the issues under existing law that could significantly affect our opinion have not yet been authoritatively addressed by the IRS or the courts, and our opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Hence, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge, or that the courts will agree with, our conclusions. 

  

 Based upon, and subject to, the foregoing and the next paragraph below, we are of the opinion that, commencing with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013 and through its taxable year ended December 31, 2018, the Company has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and for the hypothetical short tax year beginning January 1, 2019 and ending with the Closing, taking into account the BTC Spinoff but not the Merger, its organization and method of operation has enabled it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. 

  

 We undertake no obligation to update this opinion, or to ascertain after the date hereof whether circumstances occurring after such date may affect the conclusions set forth herein. We express no opinion as to matters governed by any laws other than the Code, the Treasury Regulations, published administrative announcements and rulings of the IRS, and court decisions.

Re: BTC Spinco 
  Status as a Real Estate Investment Trust

  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  

 We are acting as counsel to BTC Spinco, a [Maryland corporation] (the " _Company_ "), in connection with the merger (the " _Merger_ ") of Rockies Acquisition LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Merger Sub_ "), with and into Industrial Properties Trust Inc., a Maryland corporation (" _IPT_ ") pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of July 15, 2019 and as amended from time to time, by and among IPT, Merger Sub and Prologis, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (" _Parent_ "). Capitalized terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 We are providing this opinion letter to you in connection with the Merger at the request of the Company in accordance with Section 8.2(f) of the Merger Agreement. Although you may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, the federal tax treatment and federal tax structure of the Company and all materials of any kind that were provided to you by us relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, this opinion is intended for your benefit, and may be relied upon by Parent and IPT, in connection with the Merger Agreement. You may not authorize any other person or entity to rely on this opinion, or otherwise make this opinion available for the benefit of any other person or entity, without our prior written consent. 

  

 In our capacity as counsel to the Company and for purposes of rendering this opinion, we have examined and relied upon the following, with your consent: (i) the Merger Agreement; (ii) the Distribution Agreement (the " _Distribution Agreement_ "), dated as of [ * ], 2019 and as amended from time to time, by and among the Company and IPT, (iii) a certificate executed by duly appointed officers of the Company (the " _Company Officer\'s Certificate_ ") setting forth certain factual representations, dated [ * ], 2019, and (iv) such other documents as we have considered relevant to our analysis. We have also examined the opinions, including officer\'s certificates and exhibits related thereto, of Greenberg Traurig, LLP, dated July 17, 2017, with respect to the qualification of IPT as a real estate investment trust (" _REIT_ ") through its taxable year ended December 31, 2016. In addition, we have examined such other documents as we have considered relevant to our analysis. In our examination of such documents, we have assumed the authenticity of original documents, the accuracy of copies, the genuineness of signatures, and the legal capacity of signatories. We have also assumed that all parties to such documents have acted, and will act, in accordance with the terms of such documents.

While we have made such inquiries and investigations    

as we have deemed necessary, we have not undertaken an independent inquiry

 All notices, requests, claims, consents, demands and other communications under this Agreement shall be deemed duly given or made (A) if delivered in person, on the date delivered, (B) if sent by electronic mail (providing confirmation of transmission), on the date it was received, or (C) if sent by prepaid overnight courier, on the next Business Day (providing proof of delivery). For the avoidance of doubt, counsel for a Party may send notices, requests, claims, consents demands or other communications on behalf of such Party. 

   

 Section 10.3 _ Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future Law or public policy in any jurisdiction, as to that jurisdiction, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof, (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party, and (d) such terms or other provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced in any jurisdiction, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. 

   

 Section 10.4 _ Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall be deemed one and the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by electronic mail in .pdf format, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original signature. 

   

 Section 10.5 _ Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or between any of them, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in    

accordance with _Section 10.7_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. The representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an
allocation among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties. Accordingly, persons other
than the Parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date
of this Agreement or as of any other date.

  

 Section 10.6 _ Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the Parties hereto by action taken or authorized by the Company Board and the Parent Board, respectively, at any time before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and prior to the Distribution Date; _provided_ that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not be any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or the holders of shares of Company Restricted Stock, or which by applicable Law requires the further approval of the stockholders of Company without such further approval of such stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by each of the Parties. 

  

 Section 10.7 _ Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Spinoff Effective Time, the Parties hereto may, subject to the requirements of applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other Parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights. No single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Any waiver shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given and shall not constitute a waiver to any subsequent or other exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder. 

  

 Section 10.8 _ Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all Actions (whether at Law, in contract or in tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Maryland without giving effect to any choice or conflicts of Law principles (whether of the State of Maryland or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Maryland. 

  

 Section 10.9 _ Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each Party irrevocably agrees and consents (a) to submit itself to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Maryland Court for the purpose of any Action (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise), directly or indirectly, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the Parties in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement, (b) that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (c) that it waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Action in the Maryland Court and agrees not to plead or claim in the Maryland Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum, (d) that it will not bring any Action relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the actions of the parties hereto in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement of this Agreement in any court other than the Maryland Court, and (e) that a final judgment in any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to request and/or consent to the assignment of any Action to the Maryland Court\'s Business and Technology Case Management Program. Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect the rights of any Party to pursue appeals from any judgments or order of the Maryland Court as provided by Law. Each Party agrees, (x) to the extent such Party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the State of Maryland, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Maryland as such Party\'s agent for    

acceptance of legal process, and (y) that service of process may also be made
on such Party by prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt
validated by the United States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid
service. Service made pursuant to _clauses (x)_ or _(y)_ above shall have
the same legal force and effect as if served upon such Party personally
within the State of Maryland.

  

 Section 10.10 _ Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 10.11 _ Remedies_. 

  

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. 

  

 (b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 9_, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement without proof of damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby waives (a) any defense in an Action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. Each Party agrees that the right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right neither Company or BTC Spinco, on the one hand, nor Parent, on the other hand, would have entered into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other equitable remedies to the extent permitted by this _Section 10.11_ and the payment of damages as contemplated by _Section 9.2_, but shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award of damages if specific performance or other equitable remedies are awarded and consummation of the Merger occurs and shall not be entitled or permitted to receive an award of specific performance or other equitable remedies if damages are awarded. 

  

  

 Section 10.12 _ Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.12. 

  

 Section 10.13 _ Authorship_. The Parties agree that the terms and language of this Agreement are the result of negotiations among the Parties and their respective advisors and, as a result, there shall be no presumption that any ambiguities in this Agreement shall be resolved against any Party. Any controversy over construction of this Agreement shall be decided without regard to events of authorship or negotiation.
