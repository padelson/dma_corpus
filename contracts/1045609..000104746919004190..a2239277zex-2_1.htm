<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties hereto wish to effect a business combination through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Company (such merger transaction, the

to which each outstanding Class&nbsp;A Common Share, $0.01 par value per share, of Company (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Class&nbsp;A Common Shares</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and each outstanding
Class&nbsp;T Common Share, $0.01 par value per share, of Company (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Class&nbsp;T Common Shares</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>" and together with the Class&nbsp;A Common
Shares, the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company Common Stock</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, will be converted into the right to receive the Per

Agreement and in accordance with the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>MGCL</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"); </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i)&nbsp;each Special Company Partnership Unit shall be redeemed by Company&nbsp;LP in exchange for the receipt by each holder of
Special Company Partnership Units of a number of Company Partnership Units in accordance with the terms of </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;3.2(b)</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> hereof, and
(ii)&nbsp;immediately following such redemption described in clause&nbsp;(i), but prior to the Effective Time, each Company Partnership Unit not held by Company shall automatically be converted
into one Class&nbsp;A Common Share; </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors of Company (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Company Board</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), on behalf of Company, has (a)&nbsp;unanimously determined that the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Company and its stockholders, (b)&nbsp;unanimously authorized and approved the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (c)&nbsp;unanimously directed that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be submitted to a vote of the holders of Company Common Stock, and (d)&nbsp;unanimously resolved to recommend the approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by Company stockholders; </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Board of Directors (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Parent Board</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") of Prologis,&nbsp;Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Parent
General Partner</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"), in its capacity as the sole general partner of Parent, has (a)&nbsp;on behalf of Parent, (x)&nbsp;unanimously determined that this Agreement, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are advisable and in the best interests of Parent and its partners and (y)&nbsp;unanimously authorized and approved the execution, delivery

all actions required for the execution of this Agreement by Merger Sub and to approve and adopt this Agreement and to approve the consummation by Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger will be treated as a taxable sale of all of the Company Common Stock and the Company Restricted Stock by the
holders thereof to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration; </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS,
the Parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the execution of this Agreement and to prescribe various conditions

relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, this opinion is intended for your benefit, and may be relied upon by Parent, in connection with the Merger Agreement. You may not authorize any other

with respect to the qualification of the Company as a real estate investment trust ("</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>REIT</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") through its taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2016. In

either in the course of our representation of the Company or for the purpose of rendering this opinion. While we have reviewed all representations made to us to determine their reasonableness,
and nothing has come to our attention that would cause us to question the accuracy of such representations, we have no assurance that they are or will ultimately prove to be accurate. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
note that the tax consequences addressed herein depend upon the actual occurrence of events in the future, which events may or may not be consistent with any representations made to
us for purposes of this opinion. In particular, the qualification and taxation of the Company as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes depends upon the Company's ability to meet on a continuing
basis certain distribution levels, diversity of stock ownership, and the various qualification tests imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>Code</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>"). To the extent that the facts differ from those represented to or assumed by us herein, our opinion should not be relied upon. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our
opinion herein is based on existing law as contained in the Code, final and temporary Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative pronouncements of the Internal
Revenue Service (the "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>IRS</I></B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>") and court decisions as of the date hereof. The provisions of the Code and the Treasury Regulations, IRS administrative
pronouncements and case law upon which this opinion is based could be changed at any time, perhaps with retroactive effect. In addition, some of the issues under existing law that could significantly
affect our opinion have not yet been authoritatively addressed by the IRS or the courts, and our opinion is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Hence, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not
challenge, or that the courts will agree with, our conclusions. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based
upon, and subject to, the foregoing and the next paragraph below, we are of the opinion that, commencing with its taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 and through its
taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2018, the Company has been organized and has operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and for the
hypothetical short tax year beginning January&nbsp;1, 2019 and ending with the Closing, taking into account the BTC Spinoff but not the Merger, its organization and method of operation has enabled
it to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
undertake no obligation to update this opinion, or to ascertain after the date hereof whether circumstances occurring after such date may affect the conclusions set forth herein. We

as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any

Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Article&nbsp;9</I></FONT><FONT
SIZE=2>, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement without proof of damages or otherwise, in addition to any other remedy to which such Party is
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the Parties hereby waives (a)&nbsp;any defense in an Action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate to prevent or restrain breaches or
threatened breaches and (b)&nbsp;any requirement under any Law to post a security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. Each Party agrees that the right of specific performance and other
equitable relief is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right neither Company or BTC Spinco, on the one hand, nor Parent, on the other hand, would have
entered into this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties may pursue both a grant of specific performance or other equitable remedies to the extent permitted by this </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;10.11</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and
the payment of damages as contemplated by </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;9.2</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, but shall not be
entitled or permitted to receive an award of damages if specific performance or other equitable remedies are awarded and consummation of the Merger occurs and shall not be entitled or permitted to
