Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, 51 West 52nd

Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such other, later date and
time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the Certificate of
Merger in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and the DLLCA
(such date and time is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

Company, all as provided under the DGCL and the DLLCA.

effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
formation of the

 



\- 2 -   Surviving Company until thereafter amended in accordance with the provisions
thereof and applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, the limited liability company agreement of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the

amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

Section 1.6  _Directors_. Subject to applicable Law, the directors of Merger
Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of
the Surviving Company and shall hold office until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or

Section 2.1  _Effect on Capital Stock_.

herein) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
shares of Company Common Stock owned or held by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, as set forth below.

(iii)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the other provisions
of _Article II_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to or upon the Effective Time, including shares of Company
Common Stock that are deemed to be outstanding with respect to Company
Electing Awards

 



\- 3 -   pursuant to _Section 2.5_, but excluding any Cancelled Shares or Dissenting
Shares (as defined herein) (each, a " _Company Share_ "), shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
following consideration (collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

 

(A) for each Company Share with respect to which a Stock Election (as defined
herein) has been validly made and not revoked pursuant to _Section 2.3_
(collectively, the " _Stock Election Shares_ "), the right to receive from
Parent the fraction of a share of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
Parent Common Stock as is equal to the Exchange Ratio (collectively, the "
_Stock Consideration_ ");

(B) for each Company Share with respect to which a Cash Election (as defined
herein) has been validly made and not revoked pursuant to _Section 2.3_
(collectively, the " _Cash Election Shares_ "), the right to receive in cash
from Parent an amount equal to the Per Share Amount (collectively, the "

2.3_ (collectively, the " _Non-Election Shares_ "), the right to receive from
Parent the Merger Consideration as is determined in accordance with _Section
2.2_.

 

(D) Definitions:



     | (1) | " _Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the quotient of (a) the Per
Share Amount divided by (b) the Parent Closing Price. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (2) | " _Per Share Amount_ " shall mean the sum of (A) $25.00 plus
(B) the product of 0.6531 (the " _Share Ratio_ ") times the Parent Closing
Price. 
---|---|--- 



     | (3) | " _Parent Closing Price_ " shall mean the average, rounded
to the nearest one tenth of a cent, of the closing sales prices of shares of
Parent Common Stock on the NYSE as reported by _The Wall Street Journal_ for
the ten trading days immediately preceding the date which is five trading days
immediately prior to the date on which the Effective Time occurs. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (4) |

" _Cash Component_ " shall mean (A) $3,313,502,625 minus (B) the product of
(1) $25.00 and (2) the sum of (a) the excess of (i) the number of Cancelled
Shares over (ii) 14,960,232, (b) the number of Company Restricted Shares
forfeited after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
and (c) the number of Company Electing RSUs forfeited after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time plus (C) the product of (1) $25.00
and (2) the number of Company Shares issued with respect to Company Options
outstanding on the  

---|---|--- 
 



\- 4 -  exercised following the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. The Cash
Component excludes any amount paid or payable with respect to Company Cash
RSUs and Company SARs. 
---|--- 

All Company Shares converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_ shall no longer be outstanding
and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the
Effective Time, and uncertificated Company Shares represented by book-entry
form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate that, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, represented any such Company Shares (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration and the Fractional Share Cash Amount (as defined herein)
into which the Company Shares represented by such Book-Entry Share or
Certificate have been converted pursuant to this _Section 2.1_, as well as
any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Company Shares
become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_.

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate consideration to be paid by
Parent in respect of the Merger Consideration to holders of Company Shares
(including Company Electing Awards) shall be equal to the Cash Component
(assuming all Dissenting Shares receive cash equal to the Per Share Amount)
and 86,561,944 shares of Parent Common Stock (provided that the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued shall be reduced by the product of
(A) 0.6531 and (B) the sum of (1) the excess of the number of Cancelled
Shares over 14,960,232, (2) the number of Company Restricted Shares forfeited
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, and (3) the
number of Company Electing RSUs forfeited after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Effective Time, and shall be increased by the product of (A)
0.6531 and (B) the number of Company Shares issued with respect to Company
Options outstanding on the date hereof and set forth on the
Company Disclosure Schedule exercised following the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time.

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding Company Shares held by a
person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not voted in favor of, or
consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has complied with all the
provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of Company Shares to
demand appraisal of their (the " _Appraisal Provisions_ ") Company Shares ("
_Dissenting Shares_ "), to the extent the Appraisal Provisions are
applicable, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as described in _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, but shall become the
right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to such
Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL. If such Dissenting Stockholder withdraws its demand for appraisal or
fails to perfect or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case
pursuant to the DGCL, each of such Dissenting Stockholders Company Shares
shall thereupon be deemed to be Non-Election Shares for all purposes of this
Agreement, unless such Dissenting Stockholder shall thereafter otherwise make
a timely Election (as defined herein) under this Agreement. If any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall have so failed to perfect or has effectively withdrawn
or lost such Dissenting Stockholders right of appraisal after the Election
Deadline (as defined herein), each of such Dissenting Stockholders Company
Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have
become, as of the

 



\- 5 -   Effective Time, the right to receive Stock Consideration or Cash
Consideration, or a combination thereof, as determined by Parent in its sole
discretion. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal of Company Shares received by the Company, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
and shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect thereto. The Company shall not, without the prior
written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands.

 

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by _Article V_ ), the outstanding Company
Shares or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split, reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar
event shall have occurred, then the Share Ratio shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; _provided_ that
nothing in this  _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the Company
to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement.

(d) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in connection with the Merger, no certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered upon the
conversion of Company Shares pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Company
Shares converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
shares represented by the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof and upon surrender thereof, cash
(without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the Parent
Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all
Company Shares held by such holder at the Effective Time and rounded to the
nearest one thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock
to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (the " _Fractional Share
Cash Amount_ "). No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights
or any other rights in respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock.

 

Section 2.2 _Proration_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement, the total
number of Company Shares to be converted into Cash Consideration pursuant to
_Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to include
the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time), (the " _Cash
Conversion Number_ "), shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i)
the Cash Component by (ii) the Per Share Amount. All other Company Shares
(other than Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into
Stock Consideration.

(b) Within five (5) business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent (as defined herein) to effect the allocation among the
holders of Company 

 



\- 6 -   Shares (including holders of Company Electing Awards) of the rights to
receive the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration as follows:

 

(i) if the aggregate number of Company Shares with respect to which Cash
Elections shall have been made (which, for this purpose, shall be deemed to
include the Dissenting Shares determined as of the Effective Time) (the "
_Total Cash Election Number_ ") exceeds the Cash Conversion Number, then (A)
all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and (B) Cash Election Shares of
each holder thereof will be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Cash Election Shares held by
such holder by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Cash Conversion
Number and the denominator of which is the Total Cash Election Number (with
the Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 2.2(a)_, whether
fractions of Cash Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with the
remaining number of such holders Cash Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration; and

(ii) if the Total Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion
Number (the amount by which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Total Cash
Election Number being referred to herein as the " _Shortfall Number_ "), then
all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration, and the Stock Election Shares and Non-Election Shares
shall be treated in the following manner:

(x) if the Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares, then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of each
holder thereof shall convert into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
in respect of that number of Non-Election Shares equal to the product obtained
by multiplying (1) the number of Non-Election Shares held by such holder by
(2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Shortfall Number and the
denominator of which is the total number of Non-Election Shares (with the
Exchange Agent to determine, consistent with _Section 2.2(a)_,
whether fractions of Non-Election Shares shall be rounded up or down), with
the remaining number of such holders Non-Election Shares being converted into
the right to receive the Stock Consideration; or

 

(y) if the Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non- Election Shares, then
(1) all Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the
Cash Consideration and (2) all Stock Election Shares shall convert into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of that number of Stock
Election Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number
of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by (B) a fraction, the numerator
of which is the amount by which (1) the Shortfall Number exceeds (2) the total
number of Non-Election Shares, and the denominator of which is the total
number of Stock Election Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine,
consistent with _Section 2.2(a)_, whether fractions of Stock Election Shares
shall be rounded up or down), with the remaining number of

 



\- 7 -   such holders Stock Election Shares being converted into the right to
receive the Stock Consideration.

Section 2.3 _Election Procedures_.

(a) _Elections_. Each person who is a record holder of shares of Company
Common Stock and/or who holds Company Electing Awards on the Election Form
Record Date (as defined herein) shall have the right to submit an Election
Form specifying (an " _Election_ ") the number of Company Shares, if any,
held by such person, whether directly or pursuant to any Company Electing
Awards, in any case, that such person desires to have converted into the right
to receive Stock Consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ") and the number of
such Company Shares that the holder desires to have converted into the right
to receive Cash Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ "). Holders of record of
Company Shares who hold such Company Shares as nominees, trustees or in other
representative capacities may submit a separate Election Form on or before the
Election Deadline with respect to each beneficial owner for whom such nominee,
trustee or representative holds such Company Shares. 

(b) _Appointment of Exchange Agent_. Prior to mailing of the Election Form,
Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
payment of the Merger Consideration and shall enter into an agreement (the "
_Exchange Agent Agreement_ ") relating to the Exchange Agents
responsibilities under this Agreement.

(c) _Mailing of Election Form; Election Deadline_. Parent shall prepare and
cause to be mailed a form of election, which form shall be subject to the
reasonable approval of the Company (the " _Election Form_ "), with the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the record holders of Company Common Stock as of the
record date for the Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Election Form Record
Date_ ") and to each holder of Company Electing Awards as of such date, which
Election Form shall be used by each such record holder of shares of Company
Common Stock and each such holder of Company Electing Awards who wishes to
make an Election. Any such holders Election shall have been properly made
only if the Exchange Agent shall have received at its designated office,
by 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on a date prior to the Effective Time to be
mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company and publicly disclosed (the "
_Election Deadline_ "), an Election Form properly completed and signed and
accompanied (in the case of record holders of shares of Company Common Stock)
by Certificates (unless such shares of Company Common Stock are Book-Entry
Shares, in which case the holders shall follow the instructions set forth in
the Election Form) of Company Common Stock to which such Election Form
relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer
on the books of the Company (or customary affidavits and indemnification
regarding the loss or destruction of such Certificates or by an appropriate
guarantee of delivery of such Certificates as set forth in such Election Form;
_provided_ that such Certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent
within five (5) business days after the date of execution of such guarantee
of delivery).

(d) _Ability to Revoke Election Forms_. Any stockholder or holder of Company
Electing Awards may (i) change his Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline, accompanied by a properly
completed and signed revised Election Form or (ii) revoke his Election by
written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the

 



\- 8 -   Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his
Certificates (if applicable), or of the guarantee of delivery of such
Certificates (if applicable), previously deposited with the Exchange Agent.
All Election Forms shall automatically be revoked if the Exchange Agent is
notified in writing by Parent and the Company that the Merger has been
abandoned and that this Agreement has been terminated. If an Election Form
is revoked, the Certificate(s) (or guarantees of delivery, as appropriate),
if any, for the Company Shares to which such Election Form relates shall be
promptly returned to the stockholder submitting the same to the Exchange
Agent.

 

(e) _Determination of Exchange Agent Binding_. Subject to the provisions of
the Exchange Agent Agreement, the determination of the Exchange Agent shall
be binding as to whether an Election shall have been properly made or revoked
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ with respect to Company Shares and when
Elections and revocations were received by it. Subject to the provisions of
the Exchange Agent Agreement, if the Exchange Agent determines that any
Election was not properly made with respect to any Company Shares, such
Company Shares shall be treated by the Exchange Agent as Non-Election Shares.
Subject to the provisions of the Exchange Agent Agreement, the Exchange Agent
also shall make all computations as to the allocation and the proration
contemplated by _Section 2.2_, and absent manifest error any such computation
shall be conclusive and binding on the holders of the Company Shares.

together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within five (5) business days of the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of Company Shares and each holder of Company Electing Awards whose Company
Shares were converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ or  _Section 2.5_
(other than those holders who have properly completed and submitted, and have
not revoked, Election Forms pursuant to _Section 2.3_) into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass (as applicable), only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree upon prior to
the Effective Time) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
(as applicable) in exchange for the Merger Consideration, any Fractional
Share Cash Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section
2.4(d)_. 

 



\- 9 -  (c) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, if applicable,

and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may customarily be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or Company Electing Awards,
in any case, shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect of the shares represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares or Company Electing Awards, in any case,
pursuant to this Agreement, together with any Fractional Share Cash Amount and
any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares or Company Electing Awards become entitled in accordance with _Section
2.4(d)_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer or stock records of the Company,

to such a transferee if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or
other similar Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall
be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate
or Book-Entry Share or with respect to any Company Electing Awards and, until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.4_, each Certificate and
Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive, with respect to Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration deliverable
in respect of the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares pursuant to this Agreement, together with any Fractional Share Cash
Amount and any dividends or other distributions to which such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_.

(d) _Treatment of Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other distributions,
if any, with a record date after the Effective Time with respect to Parent
Common Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Share
to be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to  _Section
2.1(a)(iii) _until such holder shall surrender such share in accordance with
this _Section 2.4_. After the surrender in accordance with this _Section
2.4_ of a Company Share to be converted into shares of Parent Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive (in addition to the Merger Consideration and any Fractional Share Cash
Amount payable to such holder pursuant to this _Article II_ ) any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the share of Parent Common
Stock represented by such Company Share.

 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The shares of
Parent Common Stock delivered and cash paid in accordance with the terms of
this _Article II_ upon conversion of any Company Shares shall be deemed to
have been delivered and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Company Shares. From and after the Effective Time, (i) all holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of Company other than the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section
2.4(b)_ (together with any Fractional Share Cash Amount and any dividends or
other 

 



\- 10 -   distributions to which such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become
entitled in accordance with _Section 2.4(d)_), without interest, and (ii) the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to all
Company Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Company of Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing Company
Shares are presented to the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article II_ , subject to applicable Law in the
case of Dissenting Shares.

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Book- Entry Shares pursuant to this _Article II_ ,
and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock and holders of Company Electing Awards at
the Effective Time in the amount of such losses, which additional funds will
be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. Any interest or other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent, upon demand.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for 180 days after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_
shall thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Company (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any
dividends and distributions which such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this _Article II_ without any interest thereon.

(h) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration
or the cash to be paid in accordance with this _Article II_ that remains
undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the
second anniversary of the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which the Merger Consideration or such cash would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Entity), shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Company,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Company, Parent and the
Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of a Certificate or
Book-Entry Share or any holder of any Company Stock Awards pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as may be required to 

 



\- 11 -   be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under
applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted, withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(j) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent
or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as
Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving
Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Exchange Fund and subject to _Section
2.4(g)_, Parent) shall deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration and any dividends and
distributions deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

as of the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, (i) vest in full (to

shares of Parent Common Stock (which stock appreciation rights shall be cash-
or stock-settled in accordance with the settlement terms applicable to the
related Company SAR), on the same terms and conditions (other than vesting
conditions, which shall not apply) as were applicable to such Company SAR
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, an " _Adjusted SAR_ "), except
that (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Adjusted
SAR, rounded down to the nearest whole share, shall be determined by
multiplying the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange
Ratio, and (B) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock subject to
such Adjusted SAR shall equal the per share exercise or strike price of the
Company SAR immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent.

(b) _Company RSUs._ All Company RSUs that have been granted or contractually
promised by the Company as of the date of this Agreement and that remain or

shares of Company Common Stock upon the Effective Time, and shall, as of the
Effective Time, be converted into, and canceled in exchange for, the right to

such Merger Consideration to be paid or provided at the time or times
contemplated by the original award agreement.

 

(ii) _Cash-Settled Company RSUs_. Each Existing RSU that, by its terms, would

covering shares of Parent Common Stock (an " _Adjusted Interim Full Value
Award_ "), except that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
such Adjusted Interim Full Value Award, rounded down to the nearest whole
share, shall be determined by multiplying the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the related Company Interim Award immediately prior to
the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, with each Adjusted Interim Full
Value Award to continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as were
applicable to the related Company Interim Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, including without limitation, the vesting schedule, terms
of acceleration, if any, and payment provisions.

Appreciation Award shall equal the per share exercise or strike price of the
related Company Interim Award immediately prior to the Effective
Time, divided by the Exchange Ratio and rounded up to the nearest whole cent,
with each Adjusted Interim Appreciation Award to continue to be subject to the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to the related Company Interim
Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, including without limitation,

Awards (collectively, the " _Company Stock Awards_ ") as contemplated by this
_Section 2.5_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of Company Stock
Awards (other than Company SARs (which shall continue as Adjusted SARs) and
Company Interim Awards (which shall continue as Adjusted Interim Full Value
Awards or Adjusted Interim Appreciation Awards, as applicable)) shall have no
rights with respect thereto other than any rights to receive Merger
Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

since January 1, 2011 (all such documents and reports filed or furnished by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As
of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the
Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except that information set forth in the
Company SEC Documents as of a later date (but before the date of this
Agreement) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (the "
_Company Financial Statements_ ") (i) fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, as of the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective
periods then ended, (ii) were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of the
unaudited statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the
absence of footnote disclosure) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto),
(iii) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books
and records of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, and (iv) comply

thereof, (ii) were prepared in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in
the notes thereto), (iii) to the knowledge of the Company, have been
prepared from, and are in accordance

 



\- 19 -   with, the books and records of BP and Shell, respectively, and (iv) comply

Company related to the GOM Acquisition included in the Company SEC Documents
(the " _Pro Forma Financial Statements_ ") comply as to form in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under
the Exchange Act, the pro forma adjustments are appropriate to give effect to
the transactions referred to therein and have been properly applied to the
historical amounts in the compilation of such Pro Forma Financial Statements
and the assumptions used in the preparation of such pro forma financial
statements are reasonable.

(e) There are no outstanding or unresolved comments in any comment letters of
the staff of the SEC received by the Company relating to the Company SEC
Documents. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent true, correct

SEC occurring since January 1, 2010. None of the Company SEC Documents is, to
the knowledge of the Company, the subject of ongoing SEC review. 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to
any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the
Companys financial statements or other Company SEC Documents.

 

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Except with respect to the operations of the
BP Assets and the Shell Assets to be acquired, the Companys disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2011,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Based on its
most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting prior to
the date hereof, management of the Company has disclosed to the Companys
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of 

 



\- 20 -   Directors of the Company (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the Companys ability to report financial information and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal control over financial
reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness and fraud so disclosed to
auditors, if any, has been disclosed to Parent prior to the date hereof.

 

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued,
absolute, determined or contingent, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated

or obligations disclosed and provided for in the balance sheets included in
the Company Financial Statements or the Pro Forma Financial Statements (or in
the notes thereto) filed and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred in accordance with or in
connection with this Agreement, (iii) liabilities or obligations incurred
since December 31, 2011 in the ordinary course of business, (iv) liabilities

foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order,
injunction, decree or agency requirement of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except where such non-
compliance, default or violation would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2010, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or, to
the Companys knowledge, other communication from any Governmental
Entity regarding any actual or possible material violation of, or material
failure to comply with, any Law.

permits, easements, variances, exceptions, consents, certificates, approvals,
clearances, permissions, qualifications and registrations and orders of all

notices and other documents with all Governmental Entities necessary for the
Company and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and
assets and to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the "
_Company Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of the Company
Permits or to have filed such tariffs, reports, notices or other
documents would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries. All Company Permits are valid and in full force
and effect and are not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding
that could result in modification, termination or revocation thereof, except
where the failure to be in full force and effect or any modification,
termination or revocation thereof would not have, individually or in

its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with the terms and requirements of
all material Company Permits.

Company nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee,

Company regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters with respect to
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, and (ii) to the knowledge of the
Company, no attorney representing the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company, whether or not employed by the Company or any Subsidiary of the

of the Company or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents to the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee thereof, or
to the General Counsel or Chief Executive Officer of the Company.

administrative or judicial) pending, or, to the Companys knowledge,

to give rise to any fine, penalty, remediation, investigation, obligation or
liability of any kind to the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iv) none of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the Companys knowledge, any third-party
operator of any of the Oil and Gas Interests of the Company and its

\- 23 -  (c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has taken any corrective action or made a filing under any
voluntary correction program of the IRS, Department of Labor or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Benefit Plan and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any knowledge of any plan defect that
would qualify for correction under any such program. All contributions
required to be made to any Company Benefit Plan by applicable Law or by any
plan document or other contractual undertaking, and all premiums due or
payable with respect to insurance policies funding any Company Benefit Plan,
have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required to be
made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on the
books and records of Company.

 

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section

favorable determination letter or prototype opinion letter from the IRS for
the most recent cycle applicable to such Qualified Plan pursuant to Revenue
Procedure 2005-66 (as amended or otherwise revised by subsequent IRS
guidance), and such determination letter has not been revoked (nor, to the
Companys knowledge, has revocation been threatened), and there are no
existing circumstances and no events have occurred that could reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such Qualified
Plan or the related trust. No trust funding any Company Benefit Plan is
intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9).

 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is, and in the last six years, none of the Company
and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has
maintained, established, contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any

412, 430 or 4971 of the Code. Except as set forth in Section 3.9(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any

least two of whom are not under common control (a "multiple employer
plan"), and none of Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability to a multiemployer plan or a
multiple employer plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from
such plan that has not been satisfied in full.

(f) (i) There are no pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations which have been asserted or instituted, and (ii) to the Companys
knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a
claim or lawsuit against the Company with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan, the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their
duties to the Company Benefits Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under
any of the Company Benefit Plans, which, in the case of clause (i) and (ii),
could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates or any
Company Benefit Plan.

 



\- 24 -  (g) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates has any unsatisfied liability under Title IV or Section 302 of
ERISA or Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code, and none of the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has incurred any liability
for breach of fiduciary duty or any other failure to act or comply in
connection with the administration or investment of the assets of any Company
Benefit Plan under or pursuant to Title I of ERISA or the penalty, excise Tax
or joint and several liability provisions of the Code, which could reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates or any Company
Benefit Plan. No prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, other than a transaction that is exempt
under a statutory or administrative exemption) has occurred with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan.

 

(h) No Company Benefit Plan provides for any post-employment or post-
retirement medical or life insurance benefits for retired, former or current
employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by
Section 4980B of the Code or any similar law.

(i) Each Company Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (a " _Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan_ ") has been operated between January 1, 2005 and
December 31, 2008 in good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and
applicable guidance thereunder and since January 1, 2009 has been in
documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code, except
where any such noncompliance could not reasonably be expected to result in a
material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as set
forth in Section 3.9(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company is
not party to, or otherwise obligated under, any contract, agreement, plan or
arrangement that provides for the gross-up of taxes imposed by Section
409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code.

 

(j) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, director, consultant or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or accrued
pension benefit or any other compensatory payment, (ii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such
employee, director, consultant or officer, (iii) trigger any funding
obligation under any Company Benefit Plan or impose any restrictions or
limitations on the Companys rights to administer, amend or terminate any
Company Benefit Plan, or (iv) except as set forth on Schedule 3.9(j), result
in any payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any

licenses, permits, approvals or filings that are not required to be obtained
or made prior to consummation of such transactions or that, if not obtained or
made, would not materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or have, individually or

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement do
not, and (assuming the Parent Approvals are obtained) the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions hereof
will not (i) result in any loss, or suspension, limitation or impairment of
any right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to own or use any assets
required for the conduct of their business or result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the date
hereof by it with the SEC since January 1, 2011 (all such documents and
reports filed or furnished by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Parent
SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of

 



\- 38 -   the date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the
Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except that information set forth in the
Parent SEC Documents as of a later date (but before the date of this
Agreement) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (i) fairly present

of Parent, the subject of ongoing SEC review.

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of
such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or
material liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parents
financial statements or other Parent SEC Documents

Section 4.4 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
material information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents

 



\- 39 -   management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parents
internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31,
2011, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. Based
on its most recent evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting
prior to the date hereof, management of Parent has disclosed to Parents
auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of Parent (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability to report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents
internal control over financial reporting, and each such deficiency, weakness
and fraud so disclosed to auditors, if any, has been disclosed to the Company
prior to the date hereof.

 

Section 4.5 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or

Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their properties and assets and
to carry on their businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Parent

have filed such tariffs, reports, notices or other documents would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries.

to any administrative or judicial proceeding that could result in
modification, termination or revocation thereof, except where the failure to

material compliance with the terms and requirements of all material Parent
Permits.

Subsidiaries to, enforce the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any
such agreement, and the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
immediately take all steps within their power necessary to terminate any
waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any person other than Parent
or any of Parents affiliates, under any such provisions.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.4(a)_
, if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, directly or
indirectly receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal
from any person that did not result from the Companys, its affiliates or
the Companys or its affiliates Representatives breach of _Section 5.4_
and if the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Company Superior Proposal, then the Company may,
directly or indirectly, (A) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, information (including non-public information) with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the
business, properties, assets, employees, officers, Contracts, books
and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to the person who has made
such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and potential sources
of financing; _provided_ , that the Company shall substantially concurrently
with the delivery to such person provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is provided or made
available to such person or its Representatives unless such non-public
information has been previously provided or made available to Parent and (B)
engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with the
person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and
potential sources of financing regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any customary confidentiality
agreement that contains provisions that are no less favorable to the Company
than those applicable to Parent that are contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (including standstill restrictions), provided that such
confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with
any of the provisions of this _Section 5.4_

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) notify, orally and in writing, Parent after receipt by the Company
or any of its Representatives of any Company Takeover Proposal, including of
the identity of the person making the Company Takeover Proposal and the
material terms and conditions thereof, and shall promptly (and in no event
later than 24 hours after receipt) provide copies to Parent of any written
proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed,
on a prompt basis, as to the status of (including changes to any material
terms of, and any other material developments with respect to) such Company
Takeover Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours
after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised
written proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating
to such Company Takeover

 



\- 55 -   Proposal). The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter
into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement
which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with this _Section 5.4_.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.4(d)_ or by _Section
5.4(e)_, the Company Board of Directors shall not (i) (A) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold,
withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any recommendation or
public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer (other
than a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, in each case that includes a reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation) (it being understood that the Company Board of Directors may
refrain from taking a position with respect to such a tender offer or exchange
offer until the close of business as of the tenth business day after
the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action being considered a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change) or (D) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders of the Company a
Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ "), or (ii)
authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter
into any letter of intent, agreement, commitment or agreement in principle
with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with _Section 5.4(b)_
). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company Board of
Directors may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if, after
receiving a bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal that did not
result from a breach of _Section 5.4_, the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that (i) such Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and (ii) in light of such Company
Takeover Proposal, the failure to take such action would reasonably be
likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making
such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has given Parent
at least four business days prior written notice of its intention to take
such action (which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of
any such Company Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided to
Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed
transaction agreements with the person making such Company Superior Proposal
and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto (or, if not provided
in writing to the Company, a written summary of the material terms thereof),
(B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C) following
the end of such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall
have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company
Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent were to

 



\- 56 -   be given effect, and (D) in the event of any change to any of the financial
terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or
any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent
with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice
period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence (except that the four
business day period notice period referred to in clause (A) above of this
proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (1) two business days and (2)
the period remaining under the notice period under clause (A) of this proviso
immediately prior to the delivery of such additional notice under this clause
(D)) during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.4(d)_ anew with respect to such additional
notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company has complied in all material respect
with its obligations under this _Section 5.4_. 

(e) Other than in connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section 5.4(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section
5.4(e)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company
Board of Directors from making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event if the Company Board of Directors has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that the failure of the Company Board of Directors to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with
the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has given Parent at least four business
days prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which notice
shall specify the reasons therefor, (B) the Company has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such
notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to
propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such that it would permit the
Company Board of Directors not to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 5.4(e)_ , and (C) following the end of such notice
period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and
shall have determined, after consultation with its outside financial advisors
and outside legal counsel, that the Company Board of Directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law continue to require a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board of Directors from taking and disclosing to the stockholders
of the Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in the
determination in good faith of the Company Board of Directors, after
consultation with outside counsel, the failure so to disclose would reasonably
be likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law
or obligations under applicable federal securities Law of the Company Board of
Directors; _provided_ , that any such position or disclosure (other than any
"stop, look and listen" communication that includes a reaffirmation of the
Company Recommendation) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change unless the Company Board of Directors expressly and concurrently
reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

 



\- 57 -  Section 5.5 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the
Form S-4, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of Parent
and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after such filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as
necessary to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
the Companys stockholders as soon as reasonably practicable after the Form
S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take any
action required to be taken under any applicable state or provincial
securities laws in connection with the issuance and reservation of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock, or
holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, without the others prior consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the
other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent or
the Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives
oral or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or
any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly
provide the other with copies of any written communication from the SEC or
any state securities commission. If at any time prior to the Effective Time
any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Form S-4
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not
include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement by the SEC, the Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to
duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the "
_Company Stockholders  Meeting_") and not postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting except to the extent required by applicable Law or to
solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of adoption of this Agreement if
sufficient votes to constitute the Company Stockholder Approval have not been
obtained; _provided_ , that, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the
Company Stockholders Meeting may not be postponed or adjourned to a date that
is more than 20 days after the date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements
required by applicable

 



\- 58 -   Law). The Company will, except in the case of a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, through its Board of Directors, recommend that its
stockholders adopt this Agreement and will use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and to take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the
vote or consent of its stockholders required by the rules of the NYSE or
applicable Laws to obtain such approvals. The Company will not submit to the
vote of its stockholders any Company Takeover Proposal other than the Merger.

Section 5.6 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, until the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Company) to provide to the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who
are employees thereof as of the Effective Time (the "Company Employees")
compensation (including equity-based compensation) and benefit plans that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided to the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time and thereafter, Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Company to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or
maintained by Parent or the Surviving Company or their Subsidiaries in which
the Company Employees are eligible to participate (collectively, the "Post-
Closing Plans") to recognize the service of each Company Employee with the
Company or its Subsidiaries (including any predecessor thereof) prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual rates or
contribution rates under such Post-Closing Plans, in each case, to the same
extent such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time
under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee was
eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided,
that such recognition of service shall not (i) apply for purposes of
determining an accrued benefit under any defined benefit retirement plan, (ii)
apply for purposes of participation in any retiree welfare benefit plans,
(iii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Company Employee with respect to
the same period of service, or (iv) apply for purposes of any plan, program or
arrangement (x) under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides group
health insurance benefits, to the extent that such Post-Closing Plan is made
available to the Company Employees at or after the Effective Time, Parent
shall use reasonable best efforts to, or shall cause the Surviving Company to,
(A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations, eligibility waiting periods
or similar provisions under such plan to be waived with respect to such
Company Employee and his or her spouse and eligible dependents to the extent
such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (B) credit each Company Employee and his or her spouse and
eligible dependents for an amount equal to any eligible expenses incurred by
such Company Employee in the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if
later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to
participate in such Post-Closing Plan) for purposes of any applicable
deductible, co-payment and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under
any such Post-Closing Plan to the extent such expenses would have been
credited under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such credited expenses
shall also count 

 



\- 59 -   toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar
limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
following the Effective Time, while employed by Parent or the Surviving
Company, the Company Employees whose employment is governed by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement shall be provided compensation and benefits pursuant to
the terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement as in effect from
time to time.

(d) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) business days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k)
plans (the "Company 401(k) Plan"), effective as of the day prior to the
Closing Date. Following the Effective Time and as soon as practicable
following receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the
termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, the assets thereof shall
be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall, to the extent permitted
by Parents 401(k) plan (the "Parent 401(k) Plan"), permit the Company
Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions
of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section
401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans), in the form of cash, in an amount
equal to the full account balance (including loans) distributed to such
Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, honor all accrued and vested benefits and perform all
obligations under each Company Benefit Plan, employment, deferred
compensation, change in control, severance, termination or similar agreement
that is currently in effect between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any current or former director, officer, employee, consultant, independent
contractor or other service provider thereof in accordance with their terms as
in effect immediately before the Effective Time and applicable Law as such
agreements and arrangements may be modified or terminated in accordance with
their terms from time to time.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any affiliate of Parent, or shall interfere with or
restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of
their affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA,
or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by Parent, Surviving Company, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries)
or affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Company or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date,
Company and its Subsidiaries) or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any
particular Company Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 5.6 shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any
Company Employee or current or former

 



\- 60 -   service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries or
dependents thereof).

Section 5.7 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and
notices required to be filed to consummate the Merger, (ii) the satisfaction
of the conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) taking all reasonable
actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any
consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any third
party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall
include furnishing all information and documentary material required under
the HSR Act) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger
or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the Merger and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.
Additionally, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not
take any action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not
obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any such Governmental
Entity necessary to be obtained prior to Closing. To the extent that transfers
of any permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required as a result of
the execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, the
parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 5.7_. In that regard, prior
to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties to
this Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information with respect
to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their
counsel) copies of), all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or correspondence
with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger.
Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this
Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other party with copies of (or, in
the case of oral communications, advise the other party orally of) any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, and permit
the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed communication
with any such Governmental Entity. If any party to this Agreement or
any Representative of such parties receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect
to the Merger, then such party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or
cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other parties to
this Agreement, an appropriate response in substantial compliance with such
request. Neither party shall participate in any meeting or teleconference with
any Governmental Entity where material issues would likely be discussed in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger unless it consults with the
other party in advance

 



\- 61 -   and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Each party shall
furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between it
and any such Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the
Merger, and furnish the other party with such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions of
information to any such Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials provided pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ may be redacted (i) to
remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and the Merger or
other confidential information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege
concerns.

(c) Parent shall and, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, propose, negotiate,
offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and
effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to
take any action (including any action that limits its freedom of action,
ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, any
of the businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of Parent,
the Surviving Company, or any of their respective Subsidiaries) which it is
lawfully capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to
take such action (each a " _Divestiture Action_ "), in each case, as may be
required in order to avoid the commencement of any Action to prohibit the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or if already
commenced, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any Action so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event,
not later than the End Date). To assist Parent in complying with its
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.7(c)_, at Parents request the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more
agreements prior to the Closing with respect to any Divestiture Action;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the consummation of the transactions provided
for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon
the Closing. The Company shall not, without the written consent of Parent,
publicly or before any Governmental Entity or other third party, offer,
suggest, propose or negotiate, and shall not commit to or effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any Divestiture Action.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this
_Section 5.7_ or elsewhere shall require, or be deemed to require, Parent to
take or agree to take any Divestiture Action if doing so would, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) business days
after the date of this Agreement, all notifications required under the HSR
Act. In the event that the parties receive a request for information or
documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ "), the
parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such
Second Request as promptly as practicable or as otherwise instructed by
Parent, and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the
entirety of any such Second Request review process.

 



\- 62 -  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
agree that it is Parents sole right to devise the strategy for all filings,
notifications, submissions and communications in connection with any filing,
notice, petition, statement, registration, submission of information,
application or similar filing subject to this _Section 5.7_.

Section 5.8 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party
shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that all press releases and other
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, to the
extent they have not been previously issued or disclosed, shall be consistent
with such joint communications plan. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, each party shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or public statement with respect to the Merger and, subject
to the requirements of applicable Law or the rules of any securities exchange,
shall not issue any such press release or public statement prior to such
consultation. Parent and the Company agree to issue a mutually acceptable
initial joint press release announcing this Agreement.

Section 5.10  _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period of six years
from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall maintain in
effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
provisions of the Companys and any of its Subsidiaries certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or similar organizational documents in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any indemnification agreements
of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of their respective current or
former directors, officers or employees in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions or the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses
provisions of the Surviving Companys organizational documents in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who
immediately before the Effective Time were current or former directors,
officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses in respect of any

 



\- 63 -   Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.

 

(b) Parent and the Surviving Company shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in
respect of each of the foregoing) each current and former director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served
as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons
heirs, executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), in each case
against any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneys fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding
or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking consistent with the Company
Organizational Documents to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission by them in their capacities as such occurring or alleged to have
occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions in connection with such Indemnified Party serving as an officer,
director, employee or other fiduciary of any entity if such service was
at the request or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of any such
Action, the Surviving Company shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in
the defense of any such Action.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters existing or arising on or before the Effective Time;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess
of 250% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date
hereof in respect of the coverages (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") required to be
obtained pursuant hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as
reasonably practicable for such amount. If (i) the Company elects, with the
prior written consent of Parent, or (ii) Parent elects, then the Company or
Parent, as applicable, may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail
policy" with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have
occurred prior to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have
been committed by such Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such;
_provided_ that in no event shall the cost of such policy, if purchased by the
Company, exceed six (6) times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy"
is purchased, Parent shall have no further obligations under this _Section
5.10(c)_.

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.10_.

 



\- 64 -  (e) The rights of each Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.10_ shall be
in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified
Party may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other
organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Company, any other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or
otherwise.

(f) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Company under this  _Section
5.10_ shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to
adversely affect any Indemnified Party (including their successors, heirs and
legal representatives) to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies without the
consent of such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the
contrary, (i) the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section 5.10_ applies
shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.10_, and (ii) this
_Section 5.10_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall be
enforceable by such Indemnified Parties and their respective successors, heirs
and legal representatives against Parent and the Surviving Company and their
respective successors and assigns.

Section 5.11  _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any
partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and
agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
partys operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

Section 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of shares of Parent Common
Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.13 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
advisable or proper to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letters by the Closing, including
using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect each Commitment Letter
(provided that each such Commitment Letter may be amended, supplemented,
modified and replaced as set forth below), (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Sub to the funding of the Financing
set forth in each Commitment Letter and within Parents or Merger Subs
control (other than any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a
direct result of the Companys failure to comply with clauses (d) and (e) of
this _Section 5.13_) and otherwise comply with its obligations thereunder and
(iii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on
the terms and conditions contemplated by each Commitment Letter (including any
"flex" provisions), or terms and conditions not materially less favorable

 



\- 65 -   (taken as a whole) to Parent than the terms and conditions contemplated by
the Commitment Letters (including any "flex" provisions) which terms and
conditions would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the Merger.

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub
to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of, or waive any of its material rights under, any
Commitment Letter without the Companys prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that
Parent and Merger Sub may, without the Companys prior written consent (x)
enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or
waiver of any provision of any Commitment Letter that does not contain any
provisions that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the Merger; and (y)
amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify any Commitment Letter to
(subject to the terms and conditions thereof) add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed such
Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement. Upon any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification, the term "Commitment Letters" shall
include any such Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
modified. For the avoidance of doubt, each of Parent and Merger Sub may, if it
so determines in its discretion, arrange for alternative financing for the
Merger from a third party or parties reasonably satisfactory to Parent
(and thereafter the "Commitment Letters" (as modified to singular form if the
context requires) and the "Financing" as defined herein shall refer to such
financing commitment in respect of such alternative financing) on terms
and conditions not materially less favorable to Parent (taken as a whole, as
reasonably determined by Parent), if such alternative financing does not
contain any provisions that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Financing or
the Merger. If any such alternate financing is obtained Parent shall provide
the Company with a copy of any new financing commitment (redacted for
provisions related to fees, pricing, "flex" terms and any other economic
terms) that provides for such alternative financing.

(c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letters
(including the flex provisions) for any reason, and such portion is required
to fund the Cash Component, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange and obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources
reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an
amount sufficient and on terms and conditions not materially less favorable
(taken as a whole) than those described in the Commitment Letters (including
the "flex" provisions) (which terms and conditions would not reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Financing or the Merger) to enable Parent to fund the
payment of the Cash Component of the aggregate Merger Consideration. If an
Alternative Financing is required in accordance with this _Section 5.13(c)_,
Parent shall provide the Company with a copy of any new financing commitment
(redacted for provisions related to fees, pricing, "flex" terms and any other
economic terms) that provides for such Alternative Financing, and thereafter
the "Commitment Letters" (as modified to singular form if the context
requires) as defined herein shall refer to such financing commitment in
respect of the Alternative Financing.

 



\- 66 -  (d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to, at Parents sole cost
and expense, provide all cooperation that is necessary, proper or advisable in
connection with the Financing or any Alternative Financing by Parent or any of
its affiliates in connection with the Merger as may be reasonably requested
by Parent or its Representatives. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to (i) furnish, as promptly as practicable, the

independent accountants of BP Exploration and Production Inc. and BP America
Production Company) on the most recently available audited consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries and use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such auditor to the use of
such report in accordance with normal custom and practice and use reasonable
best efforts to cause such auditor to provide customary comfort letters
(providing "negative assurance" comfort) and drafts thereof to the
underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, as applicable, in
connection with such Financing or Alternative Financing; (ii) furnish, as
promptly as practicable, (A) any financial statements, schedules or other
financial data or information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries

statements, projections, audit reports and other information of the type
required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities
Act for a registered public offering to consummate the offering(s) of debt
securities contemplated by the Commitment Letters or as otherwise reasonably
necessary in connection with the Financing or Alternative Financing and the
Merger or to assist in receiving customary "comfort" (including "negative
assurance" comfort) from independent accountants in connection with the
offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Commitment Letters
(provided that it is understood that assumptions underlying pro forma
adjustments included in any pro forma financial statements or pro forma
financial information related to the Merger or any related financing shall be
the responsibility of Parent); (iii) facilitate contact between (x) senior
management and advisors, including auditors, of the Company and (y) the
proposed lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents, as applicable, and/or Parents or any of its
affiliates auditors in connection with, the Financing or any Alternative
Financing, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice; (iv) make
available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice, the
necessary employees and advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
provide reasonable assistance with the preparation of business
projections, financing documents and offer materials by Parent and its
affiliates; (v) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the reasonable
cooperation and assistance of counsel to the Company and its Subsidiaries in

information, documents, authorization letters and certificates, enter into
agreements (including supplemental indentures) and take other actions that are

advisable or desirable to permit Parent or any of its affiliates to fulfill
conditions or obligations under the Commitment Letters and any other financing
document (including all documentation and other information required by bank
regulatory authorities under applicable "know-your-customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations); (vii) provide assistance in the preparation
of one or more confidential information memoranda,

 



\- 67 -   prospectuses, offering memoranda, private placement memoranda and other

information contained therein) reasonably requested by Parent or any of its
affiliates; (viii) use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent in
ensuring that the syndication efforts benefit materially from the existing
banking relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries; (ix) permit the
reasonable use by Parent and its affiliates of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries logos for syndication and underwriting, as applicable, of
the Financing or Alternative Financing, provided that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and its or their marks; (x)
reasonably participate as necessary in a reasonable number of meetings,
presentations, customary one-on-one sessions and road shows with parties
acting as lead arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, initial purchasers or
other agents for, and prospective lenders and investors of, the Financing or
any Alternative Financing and in drafting sessions and due diligence sessions,

or more of its Subsidiaries with respect to solvency matters) and otherwise
facilitating the pledging of, and granting, recording and perfection of
security interests in share certificates, securities and other collateral,
and obtaining surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent;
_provided_ that (x) none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other liability or
obligation in connection with the Financing or any Alternative Financing or to
take any action that would be prohibited by any applicable Law or cause a
default of, or breach under, or otherwise violate any Company
Material Contract, in each case except for any payment, incurrence or action
that is conditioned upon, and shall not take effect until, the Effective Time,
and (y) no obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under any
certificate, opinion, contract, indenture or other document or instrument
delivered pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ shall be effective until the
Effective Time, and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action pursuant to this _Section 5.13_ under any
certificate, opinion, contract, indenture or other document or instrument that

Effective Time. The Company will provide to Parent and the Financing Sources
such information as may be necessary so that the marketing materials as they
relate to the Company and its affiliates are complete and correct in all
material respects.

 

(e) The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain customary

indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries specified in Section 5.13(e)

Effective Time and (ii) deliver or cause to be delivered 

 



\- 68 -   such payoff letters to Parent promptly thereafter, and in any event no later

contrary, none of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub shall take, or omit to
take, any action that would, or could reasonably be expected to, prevent or
impede the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall terminate (except
for the provisions of  _Section 7.3_ and _Article VIII_ ), and there shall
be no other liability on the part of the Company or Parent to the other except
as provided in _Section 7.3_ and liability arising out of or the result of,
fraud or any willful or intentional breach of any covenant or agreement or
willful or intentional breach of any representation or warranty in this
Agreement occurring prior to termination or as provided for in the
Confidentiality Agreement, in which case the aggrieved party shall be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

Section 7.3 _Breakup Fee; Expenses_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)(i)_ as a
result of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change due to an Intervening Event,
the Company shall pay Parent up to $69,000,000 in respect of Parents expenses
in connection with this Agreement (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "), by wire
transfer (to an account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds
within two business days after such termination. If this Agreement is
terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)(i)_ as a result of a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change due to a Company Superior Proposal or
pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)(ii)_, (ii) by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)_ and, at the time of such termination, (A) the Company Stockholder
Approval shall not have been obtained and (B) Parent would have been permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)(i)_ as a result of a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change due to a Company Superior Proposal or
pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)(ii)_, or (iii) by Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(d)_ or by Parent pursuant to  _Section
7.1(f)_, and in the case of any termination pursuant to this clause (iii), (A)
a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly announced or shall have
become publicly known, and not withdrawn at least fifteen (15) business days
prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting and (B) at any time on or prior to
the twelve month anniversary of such termination the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Company
Takeover Proposal or the transactions contemplated by any Company Takeover
Proposal are consummated, the Company shall pay Parent the Termination Fee
(less any amounts previously or concurrently paid to Parent in respect of
the Expense Reimbursement), by wire transfer (to an

 



\- 74 -   account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds (1) in the case
of clause (i), within two business days of such termination, in the case of
clause (ii) prior to or concurrently with such termination, and in the case
of clause (iii) the Expense Reimbursement within two business days of such
termination and the Termination Fee (less any amounts previously or
concurrently paid to Parent in respect of the Expense Reimbursement) upon the
earlier of entering into such definitive agreement with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by a
Company Takeover Proposal. " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount
equal to $207,000,000. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if the Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance
with this _Section 7.3(a)_, from and after such termination and payment of
the Termination Fee pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 7.3(a)_,
the Company shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in
connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby
other than as provided under this _Section 7.3(a)_, except in the case of
fraud or a willful and material breach by the Company of this Agreement. Each
of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee and Expense
Reimbursement are not intended to be a penalty, but rather are liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the
circumstances in which such Termination Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement are
due and payable and which do not involve fraud or willful and material
breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision. In no event shall Parent be entitled to more than one payment of
the Termination Fee in connection with a termination of this Agreement
pursuant to which the Termination Fee is payable, and if the Termination Fee
is payable at such time as Parent has already received payment or concurrently
receives payment from the Company in respect of Expense Reimbursement, the
amount of Expense Reimbursement actually received by Parent shall be deducted
from the Termination Fee.

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ , then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent
for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in
connection with any related Actions commenced and (ii) the Company shall pay
to Parent interest on such amount from and including the date payment of such
amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate
set forth in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was
required to be made plus 2%.

(c) Solely for purposes of this _Section 7.3_, " _Company Takeover Proposal_
" shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in _Section 8.15(b)(xv)_, except
that all references to 15% shall be changed to 50%.

otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding

exercise of any other right hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, _Sections 8.5_ , _8.6_ and _8.13_ and this sentence may not be
modified, waived or terminated in a manner that is adverse to the Financing
