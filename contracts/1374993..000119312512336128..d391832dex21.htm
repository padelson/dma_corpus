WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution of this Agreement, as an inducement to
Parents and Merger Subs willingness to enter into this Agreement and
incurring the obligations set forth herein, certain stockholders of the
Company, who hold and are entitled to vote (or to direct the voting of) an
aggregate of approximately fifty-nine percent (59%) of the outstanding shares

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Merger,

accordance with this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_business day_ " shall mean any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other

to close in the City of New York.

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Concurrently with or immediately following the
Closing, the Company shall execute and file in the office of the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger, in such form as
required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the
DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective at
the time of filing of the Certificate of Merger, or at such later time as is
agreed upon by the parties hereto and set forth therein (such time as
the Merger becomes effective is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_
").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in

Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



-2-  Section 1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the
Surviving Corporation_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b) Immediately following the Effective Time, the by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended in their entirety to read as set forth on
_Exhibit C_ hereto.

 

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers_. The Board of Directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective Time be the
initial Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of
the Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall at the Effective
Time be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to
serve until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, and
the Company shall, prior to the Closing, use its best efforts to implement
the foregoing, including by using its best efforts to obtain resignations from
the existing members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

 

ARTICLE II

in cash, without interest (the " _Cash Merger Consideration_ ") and (ii)
one non-transferable contingent payment right (a " _Contingent Payment Right_
") to be issued by Parent pursuant to the CPR Agreement (the Cash Merger
Consideration together with the Contingent Payment Rights, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock to be converted into Merger
Consideration pursuant to this  _Article II_ shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled and cease to exist, and each holder of a
Certificate, shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby, except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration into which such shares of Company Common
Stock have been converted.

 



-3-  (c) _Treasury Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock held in treasury of
the Company (the " _Company Owned Shares_ ") shall automatically be
cancelled, and no Merger Consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(d) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

(e)  _Dissenting Shares_.

(i) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, other
than  _Section 2.1(e)(ii)_, any shares of Company Common Stock held by a
holder who has properly demanded an appraisal of its shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively
withdrawn or lost the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL ("
_Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_, but instead
shall be converted into the right to receive only such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares under the DGCL.
From and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not be
entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other rights of an equity
owner of the Surviving Corporation or of a stockholder of Parent.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.1(e)(i)_, if any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal for such shares in
accordance with the DGCL shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) such appraisal right, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such holders shares shall no
longer be Dissenting Shares and shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in
_Section 2.1(a)_ of this Agreement, without any interest thereon.

 

(iii) The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal rights of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of
such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and
received by the Company which relate to any such demand for appraisal rights
and (B) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
which take place prior to the Effective Time with respect to demands for
appraisal rights under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior
written consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal rights of Company Common Stock or offer to settle or
settle any such demands.

 



-4-  Section 2.2 _Other Equity_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall have entered into
an agreement with Sola Ltd. pursuant to which Parent shall agree to cause the
Surviving Corporation to assume the performance and obligations of the Company
under that certain Warrant Agreement, dated as of April 8, 2009, as amended,
between the Company and Sola Ltd., and each unexercised warrant exercisable
for shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Warrant_ "), which is
outstanding at the Effective Time shall be cancelled at the Effective Time and
shall only entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation (i) a cash amount (without interest) equal to the
product of (x) the excess, if any, of (A) the Cash Merger Consideration over
(B) the per share exercise price of such Company Warrant and (y) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Warrant shall
not have been previously exercised and (ii) a number of Contingent Payment
Rights equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such
Company Warrant shall not have been previously exercised, calculated on a
"net exercise" basis;

(b) Parent and its Affiliates will not assume or continue or provide
substitute awards in respect of any shares of restricted Company Common Stock
(the " _Company Restricted Shares_ "). Accordingly, each Company Restricted
Share which is outstanding at the Effective Time shall be terminated at the
Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of the NextWave
Wireless Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the NextWave Wireless Inc. 2007
New Employee Incentive Plan and shall only entitle the holder thereof to the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation the Merger Consideration with
respect to each such Company Restricted Share.

Section 2.3 _Paying Agent; Surrender and Payment_.

(a) _Closing Certificate_. One (1) business day prior to the Closing Date, an
executive officer of the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate (the "
_Closing Certificate_ ") certifying on behalf of the Company (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that will be issued and outstanding as of
the Effective Time and (ii) the number of Company Stock Options that will be
converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_.

 

(b) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate, or
shall cause to be designated (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company), a bank or trust company (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") that is reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as agent for
the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common
Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") and shares of Company Common Stock represented
by book-entry (" _Company Book-Entry Shares_ "), upon surrender of such
Certificates and Company Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article
II_ from time to time after the Effective Time.

(c) _Deposit of Cash_. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent shall deposit
or shall cause to be deposited (i) with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of
the holders of Company Common Stock, cash in an amount approximately equal to
the aggregate Cash Merger

 



-5-   Consideration (the " _Exchange Fund_ ") and (ii) with an escrow agent
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), $25
million (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in U.S. Dollars into an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") to be held,
released and delivered (together with all accrued investment income thereon,
if applicable) in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

(d) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time (but in no
event later than the fifth (5th) business day thereafter), the Paying Agent
shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Company Book-Entry
Shares whose shares were converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to 
_Section 2.1_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
the Cash Merger Consideration and a number of Contingent Payment Rights
represented by book-entry, into which the number of shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Shares
shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this Agreement
(which instructions shall provide that, at the election of the surrendering
holder, Certificates and letters of transmittal (and any related
documentation) may be surrendered, and the Merger Consideration in exchange
therefor collected, by hand delivery). Each former stockholder of the Company,
upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or Company Book-Entry
Share, as applicable, together with a letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may customarily be required by the Paying Agent, shall be
entitled to receive (i) a check in an amount of U.S. dollars (after giving
effect to any required withholdings pursuant to _Section 2.3(k)_) equal to
the aggregate amount of Cash Merger Consideration and (ii) a number of
Contingent Payment Rights represented by book-entry, into which such holders
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates or Company Book Entry Shares, as applicable, were
converted in accordance with this  _Article II_. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, each Certificate or Company Book-Entry
Share (other than Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares that represent
Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Article II_. No interest will be paid
or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates or
Company Book-Entry Shares under the provisions of this _Article II_.

(e) _Exchange Procedures for Company Stock Options_. 

(i) Parent and its Affiliates will not assume or provide substitute awards in
respect of any unexercised option to purchase or acquire a share of Company
Common Stock under the Companys 2005 Stock Incentive Plan and 2007 New
Employee Incentive Plan (the " _Option Plans_ ") (each such option, a "
_Company Stock Option_ "). Accordingly, each Company Stock Option which is
outstanding at the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) shall be
terminated at the Effective Time in

 



-6-   accordance with the provisions of Section 8 of the NextWave Wireless Inc.
2005 Stock Incentive Plan and the NextWave Wireless Inc. 2007 New Employee
Incentive Plan and shall only entitle the holder thereof to the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation (i) a cash amount (without interest and
less applicable withholding) equal to the product of (x) the excess, if any,
of (A) the Cash Merger Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price of
such Company Stock Option and (y) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
for which such Company Stock Option shall not have been previously exercised
and (ii) a number of Contingent Payment Rights equal to the number of shares
of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Options shall not have
been previously exercised and that would have been delivered upon a "net
exercise" basis based on the Cash Merger Consideration amount (rounded down
to the nearest whole share); _provided_ , that for purposes of clarity, to the
extent the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option exceeds the
Cash Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be terminated
without consideration and the holder shall not be entitled to receive any
Contingent Payment Rights.

(ii) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of
the Company (the " _Board of Directors_ ") or the compensation committee of
the Board of Directors, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions and take all
actions reasonably requested by Parent to effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 2.3(e)_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that
from and after the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries will be required to deliver shares of
Company Common Stock to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company
Stock Options.

 

(iii) Parent agrees to pay or cause to be paid by wire transfer all amounts
owed by it under this  _Section 2.3(e)_ as soon as is reasonably practicable
following calculation of such amounts but no later than three (3) business
days following the Closing.

(f) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be
deemed payment in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificates or Company
Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporations obligation
to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior
to the Effective Time which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

(g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of the Company for nine (9) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered, at Parents option, to Parent. Any holders of Company
Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration.

 

(h) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no registration of
transfers on the

 



-7-   transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of the Company Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, from
and after the Effective Time, Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_
, except as otherwise provided by Law. 

(i) _No Liability_. None of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Company Book-Entry Share shall not have been surrendered prior to such date on
which any Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect
of such Certificate or Company Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, and any holders of
the Certificates or Company Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore
complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of their claim for Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any
Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.3(k)_).

 

(j) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

(k) _Tax Withholding_. Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any amounts payable under this Agreement to any holder of
Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as Parent or the
Paying Agent, as applicable, are required to withhold or deduct under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent and
duly and timely paid over to the appropriate Tax Authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options, as
the case may be, in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made
by Parent or the Paying Agent.

 

(l) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or
exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification,
stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend
or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange offer,
or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted.

and, if applicable, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or the conduct of its

Effect. The Company has Made Available to Parent complete and correct copies
of the certificates of incorporation, by-laws, or other equivalent
organizational documents of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are not in violation of any provision of their

As used in this Agreement, any reference to any state of facts, conditions,
event, change or effect having a " _Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean any
state of facts, conditions, event, change or effect that, individually or in

has, or would reasonably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on
(i) the financial condition, liabilities, business or results of operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the Transferred Spectrum
Assets, or (ii) the ability of the Company to timely consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to satisfy its
obligations hereunder and in accordance with the terms hereof, excluding from

-12-  Section 3.5 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company has filed all forms, documents and reports required to be
filed prior to the date hereof by it with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since December 31, 2010 (the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective dates, and, if amended, as of the date
of such amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied in all material
respects, and all documents required to be filed by the Company with the SEC
on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time (the " _Subsequent
Company SEC Documents_ ") will comply in all material respects, with the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Exchange Act,
as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. As of their respective dates (and, if amended, as of the date of
such amendment), the Company SEC Documents did not, and any Subsequent
Company SEC Documents filed with or furnished to the SEC will not, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (the "
_Company Financials_ ") fairly present in all material respects, and the
consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and schedules
thereto) included in the Subsequent Company SEC Documents will fairly present
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries, as of the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods then ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments) in conformity
with GAAP (except, in the case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto). Since
December 31, 2010 and prior to the execution hereof, the Company has not made
any material change in the accounting practices or policies applied in the
preparation of its financial statements, except as required by GAAP or
SEC rule or policy or applicable Law.

(c) As of March 31, 2012, the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer have devised and maintained a system of
internal control over financial reporting sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP and the rules and regulations under the Exchange Act. Such internal
control over financial reporting is effective in providing reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles and includes policies and procedures
that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the Company and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys

 



-13-   assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements. The
Company has disclosed, based on the most recent evaluation of its chief
executive officer and its chief financial officer prior to the date of this
Agreement, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Board of
Directors (A) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company internal controls. The Company maintains disclosure controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are reasonably effective to ensure that
all material information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries required
to be disclosed in the Companys periodic reports under the Exchange Act is
made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and
such disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting the
Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer to
such information required to be included in the Companys periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act. Since December 31, 2010, no material
complaints from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls
or auditing matters, and no material concerns from any employee of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries regarding questionable accounting or auditing
matters, have been received by the Company. The Company has not received
any material complaints or concerns relating to other matters made since
December 31, 2010 and through the execution of this Agreement through the
Companys whistleblower hotline or equivalent system for receipt of employee
concerns regarding possible violations of Law. No attorney representing the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Company or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Companys chief legal
officer, audit committee (or other committee designated for the purpose) of
the Board of Directors or the Board of Directors pursuant to the rules
adopted pursuant to Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or any
Company policy contemplating such reporting, including in instances not
required by those rules.

and its Subsidiaries to the extent such notification is required to be made

progress (including any routine requests for information from the PBGC).

the Note Purchase Agreements will not (either alone or together with any other
event) (i) entitle any employees, directors, consultants, former employees,
former consultants or former directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
severance, change of control or other similar pay or benefits pursuant to any
Company Benefit Plan, or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or
trigger any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise)

Agreement, to the effect that, as of such date, and subject to the assumptions
and qualifications set forth therein, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock (other than

each Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has entered
into (i) within twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof under which any
Liabilities are reasonably likely to exist following the Closing Date, (ii)
that provides an indemnification or reimbursement obligation by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to any party (unless such indemnification or
reimbursement obligation has terminated and the Company and its Subsidiaries
are not aware of

  



-24-   any demand, request or claim for indemnification or reimbursement that has
been made or may be asserted thereunder, regardless of whether the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries believes the assertion of such demand, request or
claim is valid under such contract or applicable Law), (iii) in which any
obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries remain (actual or
contingent) to the counterparty with a value or amount in excess of $50,000,
(iv) which if the Company or any such Subsidiary terminated such contract the
Company or such Subsidiary would be required to pay a fee, damages (liquidated
or otherwise) or a penalty pursuant to the terms of such contract in excess
of $10,000 (regardless of whether consent of the counterparty is provided), or
(v) in the past three years outside of the ordinary course of business (each,

Contract or Additional Contract is in material breach of or in material
default under the terms of any Company Contract or Additional Contract where
such material breaches or material defaults have had, or would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect. Except as would not reasonably be likely to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect, each Company Contract and
Additional Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company or the
Subsidiary which is party thereto and, to the Knowledge of the Company, of
each other party thereto, and is enforceable against the Company or its
applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, in accordance with its terms
(except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors rights generally or by principles governing the availability
of equitable remedies).

Section 3.22 _Takeover Statutes_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.6_, the Company Board
of Directors has taken all necessary action so that no "fair price",
"moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-takeover
statute or regulation (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") as in effect on the
date of this Agreement is applicable to the Company, Company Common Stock, the
Merger, the Voting Agreement or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

Section 3.23 _Transactions with Affiliates_. Other than pursuant to any
compensation, indemnification or other similar agreements between the Company
or a Subsidiary of the Company and any officer or director, there are no
transactions, arrangements or contracts, between the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company, on the one hand, and any Affiliate of the Company (including
the Companys Subsidiaries), on the other hand.

Subsidiaries are covered by valid and currently effective insurance policies
as set forth in _Schedule 3.24_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. All
premiums payable under such policies have been duly paid to date. As of the
date hereof, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received any
written notice of cancellation of any such policy. All material fire and
casualty, general liability, business interruption, product liability, and
sprinkler and water damage insurance policies maintained by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (" _Insurance Policies_ ") provide adequate coverage
for all normal risks incident to the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective properties and assets, except for any such
failure to maintain Insurance Policies that, individually or in the aggregate,
are not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.25 _Environmental Matters_. (a) Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have complied at all times with all applicable Environmental Laws
in all material respects; (b) no property currently owned or operated by the

any third party property that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability under any Environmental Law; (e) neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has caused, or been alleged to have caused, any
release or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance that could reasonably
be expected to result in any material liability under any Environmental Law;

demand, letter, claim or request for information alleging that the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries may be in violation of or subject to any material
liability under any Environmental Law; (g) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any order, decree, injunction or other arrangement
with any Governmental Entity or any indemnity or other agreement with any
third party relating to material liability under any Environmental Law or
relating to Hazardous Substances; (h) there are no other circumstances
or conditions involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that could
reasonably be expected to result in any material claims, liability,
investigations, costs or restrictions on the ownership, use, or transfer of
any property pursuant to any Environmental Law; and (i) none of the
properties currently or formerly used by the Company or its Subsidiaries
contain any underground storage tanks or mold that could reasonably be
expected to result in any material liability under any Environmental Law. The

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT

 

Except as disclosed in the corresponding section of the disclosure schedule

jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company as follows:

Section 4.1 _Qualification, Organization, Etc_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and, if applicable, in good
standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of incorporation and
has the corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted in all material respects. Each of Parent and Merger Sub is duly
qualified or licensed to do business and, if applicable, is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties or the conduct of its business requires such qualification,
except for jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified, licensed or
in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.2 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of
Merger Sub consists of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per

immediately prior to the Effective Time will be, owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any business prior to the

liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and the Voting Agreement and, except

the execution of this Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including the Merger. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Voting Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Board of Directors of Merger Sub and, except for the adoption of this
Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger Sub and the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of Delaware, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to
authorize the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. This Agreement and, with

 



-27-   respect to Parent only, the Voting Agreement have been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming this Agreement
constitutes the valid and binding agreement of the other parties hereto or
thereto, each of this Agreement and, with respect to Parent only, the Voting
Agreement constitutes the valid and binding agreement of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its
terms (except to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other Laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors rights generally or by principles governing the availability

Entity is necessary for the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Voting Agreement,
except for such authorizations, consents, licenses, permits, actions, orders,
approvals, registrations, declarations or filings, that, if not obtained or

(c) Subject to the receipt of the Parent Regulatory Approvals, the execution,
delivery and performance by Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and the
Voting Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and compliance with the
provisions hereof will not (i) constitute or result in any breach, violation
of, or a termination or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or
both) under, cause any additional payments under or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation, or to the loss of
a material benefit under any Contract binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, or result in the creation of any Liens upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with
or result in any violation of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or by-laws, in each case as amended, of Parent or Merger Sub, or

Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, other than,
in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), any such violation, conflict, default,
right, loss or Lien that has not, and would not reasonably be likely to
significantly impair or delay the consummation of the Merger.

Section 4.5 _Proxy Statement; Other Information_. None of the information
provided by Parent with respect to Parent or its Subsidiaries to be included
in the Proxy Statement will, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any
amendments thereof or supplements thereto, at the time of the mailing of the
Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of
the Company Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

its "affiliates" and "associates" (each as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL) do not own, and have not for the past three years owned, at any time,
shares of the Company Common Stock or other securities convertible into,
or derivative of, shares of the Company Common Stock in an aggregate amount

this _Section 4.6_, "own" or "owned" shall have the meaning

any Person any nonpublic information relating or with respect to, any
Company Alternative Proposal, or in response to any inquiries or proposals

any Company Alternative Proposal or (iv) approve, endorse, or recommend any
Company Alternative Proposal or (v) enter into any letter of intent or similar

after, the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval the Company may (A)
provide or cause its Representatives to provide information in response to a
request therefor by a Person or group of Persons who has made after the date

Proposal if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such

information to Parent to the extent not previously provided to Parent; or (B)
engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person or
group of Persons who has made such an unsolicited bona fide written Company
Alternative Proposal; if and only to the extent that, prior to taking any
action described above, (x) the Board of Directors (or the Independent
Committee) determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel that failure to take such action, in light of such Company Alternative
Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under

 



-33-   applicable Law, and (y) the Board of Directors (or the Independent
Committee) has determined in good faith based on the information then
available and after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel that such Company Alternative Proposal either constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal (as defined below) or would reasonably be expected to result
in a Company Superior Proposal.

 

(b) _"Stop-Look-and-Listen" Communication_. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board of Directors from
disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or issuing any "stop-look-and-
listen" communication, if, in the good faith judgment of the Companys Board
of Directors, after consultation with its outside legal advisors, such
disclosure is required under applicable Law; _provided_ that, if such
disclosure has the substantive effect of an Adverse Recommendation Change
(it being understood that, so long as the Company continues affirmatively to
recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereunder, it shall not be precluded from disclosing
factually accurate information with respect to any Company Alternative
Proposal or the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto), it shall be
deemed a Adverse Recommendation Change.

(c) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) " _Company Alternative Proposal"_ shall mean any proposal or offer made
by any Person or group of Persons prior to the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval (other than a proposal or offer by Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or its or their Affiliates), other than any such proposal
exclusively involving the Additional Spectrum Assets or Other Assets that
would not reasonably be expected to prevent or delay in any material respect
the Merger (so long as no non-public information relating to the Transferred
Spectrum Assets is made available to such Person or group of Persons),
relating to any direct or indirect (A) acquisition of the Company by merger or
business combination transaction, or for a "merger of equals" with the
Company; (B) acquisition by any Person of any of the Transferred Spectrum
Assets; (C) acquisition by any Person of (1) ten percent (10%) or more of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock from the Company or (2) thirty-
five percent (35%) or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock;
or (D) acquisition by the Company following which the stockholders of the
Company immediately preceding the consummation of the transaction
contemplated thereby cease to hold at least eighty-five percent (85%) of the
outstanding equity of the Company immediately following such transaction.

 

(ii) " _Company Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written Company
Alternative Proposal made by any Person or group of Persons for at least
seventy percent (70%) of the assets or outstanding shares of the Company
Common Stock (and which proposal has not been obtained by or on behalf of the
Company in material or willful violation of this  _Section 5.3 (a)_, _(b)_
or _(d)_ or material violation of _Section 5.3(e)_, and with respect to
which the Company has fulfilled its obligations pursuant to this _Section
5.3_ in all 

 



-34-   material respects, and which would not result in the existing stockholders
of the Company owing or controlling, directly or indirectly, in excess of
twenty percent (20%) of such assets or securities after such transaction) on
terms that the Board of Directors (or the Independent Committee) determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, and after taking into account all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of the proposal (and the timing and likelihood of
consummation of such transaction), the Person making the proposal and any
potential revisions to this Agreement suggested by Parent or its
Representatives are more favorable from a financial point of view to the
Company and its stockholders (taking into account the likelihood and timing of
completion and obtaining financing), and which the Board of Directors is
required to accept in order to fulfill its fiduciary duties under the DGCL.

(d) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease,
and shall instruct and use its best efforts to cause its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates and its and their Representatives to immediately terminate, any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third party with
respect to a Company Alternative Proposal and shall not take any action to
exempt any Person (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) or any action taken
by any Person from any Takeover Statute or similarly restrictive provisions of
its organizational documents or, except in order to take any actions
permitted pursuant to this _Section 5.3_, terminate, amend or waive any
provisions of any confidentiality or standstill agreements in place with any
third parties. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to
promptly inform the individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence
hereof of the obligations undertaken in this _Section 5.3_ and in the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees that it will promptly
request each Person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement
in connection with its consideration of acquiring it or any of its
Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

(e) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any
event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent if any inquiries,
proposals or offers with respect to a Company Alternative Proposal are
received by, any such information is requested from, or any such discussions
or negotiation are sought to be initiated or continued with, it, or to its
Knowledge, its Affiliates or any of its other Representatives (and shall
instruct its Affiliates and other Representatives to immediately notify the
Company of any such inquiries, proposals or offers) indicating, in connection
with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements)
and thereafter shall keep Parent informed, on a current basis, of the status
and terms of any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto)
and the status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change
in the Companys intentions as previously notified. The Company shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality
agreement with any person in connection with a Company Alternative Proposal
subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from
providing such information to Parent.

 



-35-  Section 5.4 _Proxy Material_.

 

(a) _Proxy Filing_. Within ten (10) business days after the date hereof, the
Company shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, with the
SEC the proxy statement (together with the letters to stockholders, notices of
meeting and forms of proxies to be distributed to stockholders in connection
with the Merger, and any schedules required to be filed with the SEC in
connection therewith (collectively, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") which shall (i)
except to the extent provided in _Section 5.4(d)_, include the recommendation
of the Board of Directors that the Companys stockholders adopt this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder and (ii) comply in all
material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act. Each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to
the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders promptly following the
date on which the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon
or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement. Each party shall
promptly notify the other party upon the receipt by it or any of its
Subsidiaries of any comments from the SEC or its staff, or any request from
the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and
shall provide the other party with copies of all correspondence between it or
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the other
hand, relating to the Proxy Statement.

(b) _Information Supplied_. The Company agrees that none of the information
with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries to be included in the Proxy
Statement will, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any amendments thereof
or supplements thereto, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement
or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. Parent and Merger Sub each agrees that none of the information
supplied or to be supplied by it to be included in the Proxy Statement will,
in the case of the Proxy Statement or any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments
or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Company Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

(c) _Amendment to Proxy Statement_. If at any time prior to the Company
Meeting, any information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers should be discovered by
the Company or Parent, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party, and an appropriate amendment, supplement or other filing
incorporated by reference into the Proxy Statement describing such information
shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of the Company in each case, as promptly as
reasonably practicable.

 



-36-  (d) _Stockholders Meeting_. The Board of Directors shall, by not later than
the date hereof, adopt a resolution fixing the twenty-third (23rd) business
day immediately following the date of this Agreement as the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a special
meeting of the Companys stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Meeting")_ ; provided, however,
if pursuant to clause (i) of the second sentence following this sentence and
without giving effect to this proviso the Company Meeting would occur more
than sixty days after such record date, the Board of Directors shall adopt
another resolution fixing a date that is as soon as possible and a new record
date is required as the record date for determining the stockholders entitled
to notice of or to vote thereat. Promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certified copy of the
resolution of the Board of Directors fixing the twenty-third (23rd) business
day immediately following the date hereof as the record date for determining
the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at the Company Meeting.
Within three (3) business days after the later to occur of (i) the date on
which the SEC staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that
the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement or (ii) the twenty-fourth
(24th) business day following the date hereof (or, in the event a new
record date is set pursuant to the first sentence of this subsection, as soon
as reasonably practicable following such record date), in accordance with the
DGCL and the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws, the Company
shall duly call, give notice of, and, on the twenty-first (21st) day
following the mailing of the Proxy Statement, convene and hold the Company
Meeting and shall, through the Board of Directors, subject to the terms
contained herein, recommend to its stockholders the adoption of this
Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ "). Unless there shall have been an
Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 5.4_, the Board of
Directors shall not withdraw, amend or modify, or propose or resolve to
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may only
make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Board of Directors has concluded
in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the
failure of the Board of Directors to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change
would be inconsistent with such directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. In the event that, subsequent to the date of this Agreement and prior to
the earlier of (x) the Company Meeting and (y) the termination of this
Agreement, there shall have been an Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company
shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to the holders of Company Common
Stock for adoption at the Company Meeting. "Adverse Recommendation Change"
means either of the following, as the context may indicate: (i) any failure by
the Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) to make, or any withdrawal
or modification of, or public proposal to withdraw or modify, in any manner
adverse to Parent of, the Company Recommendation, or (ii) the Company or the
Board of Directors approving, endorsing or recommending a Company Alternative
Proposal.

 

(e) _Adjournment or Postponement_. The Company shall not adjourn or postpone
the Company Meeting under any circumstances without the prior written consent
of Parent; _provided_ that the Company shall not be obligated to obtain the
prior written consent of Parent if such adjournment or postponement is needed
to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required by
Law is provided to the Companys stockholders in advance of a vote on the
Merger and this Agreement, _provided_ _further_ that such adjournment or
postponement shall be for a period as short as practicably possible.

 



-37-  Section 5.5 _Company Benefit Plans; Employee Communications_.

 

(a) If requested by Parent at least ten (10) business days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall terminate any and all Company Benefit
Plans, including without limitation any Company Benefit Plans intended to
qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that Parent
requests that any such Company Benefit Plans be terminated, the Company shall
provide Parent with evidence that such Company Benefit Plans have been
terminated pursuant to resolution of the Board of Directors (the form and
substance of which shall be subject to review and approval by Parent) not
later than the day immediately preceding the Effective Time.

(b) As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, the Company shall have settled, discharged or fully accrued on the
Estimated Liabilities Notice any and all outstanding liabilities under the
Company Benefit Plans (including any potential severance and retention
liabilities).

(c) The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not communicate with Company
employees regarding the compensation, benefits or other treatment they will
receive in connection with the proposed Merger without providing Parent with
prior notice of and the opportunity to review and comment upon any such
communications, unless any such communications are consistent with prior
directives or documentation provided to the Company by Parent.

Section 5.6  _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of (a) the occurrence of any event known to it which would
reasonably be likely to, individually or in the aggregate, (i) have a Material
Adverse Effect or (ii) cause any condition set forth in _Article VI_ to be
unsatisfied in any material respect at any time prior to the Effective Time or
(b) any action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened which questions or challenges the
validity of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice nor shall the
party giving such notice be prejudiced with respect to any such matters solely
by virtue of having given such notice.

 

Section 5.7 _Filings; Other Action_.

(a) _HSR Act Notification_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date hereof, Parent and the Company shall and shall cause their applicable
Affiliates to file all notices, reports and other documents required to be
filed by such party with any Governmental Entities with respect to the Merger
and the transactions contemplated hereby relating to matters other than the
FCC Consent (which shall be governed by the provisions of  _Sections
5.7(b)-(c)_ below), and to submit promptly any additional information
reasonably requested by such Governmental Entity. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall promptly after the
date of this Agreement but in no event later than ten

 



-38-  (10) business days after the date hereof (it being understood that the failure
to file within such ten (10) business day period shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement) prepare and file the notifications required under
the HSR Act in connection with the Merger. Parent and the Company shall, and
shall each cause its respective Affiliates to, use their reasonable best
efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries or requests
received from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger. Each of
Parent and the Company shall, and shall each cause its respective Affiliates
to, give the other party prompt notice of the commencement of any legal
proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger;
(B) keep the other party informed as to the status of any such legal
proceeding; and (C) promptly inform the other party of any communication to
or from the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other
Governmental Entity regarding the Transactions. Parent and the Company shall,
and shall each cause its respective Affiliates to, consult and cooperate with
one another to the full extent permissible under applicable Law in connection
with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument,
opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any proceeding under
or relating to the HSR Act or any other competition-related Law. In addition,
except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any legal
requirement, in connection with any proceeding under or relating to the HSR
Act or any competition Law or any other similar legal proceeding, each of
Parent and the Company will, and shall each cause its respective Affiliates
to, permit authorized representatives of the other party to be present at
each meeting or conference relating to any such proceeding solely with
respect to those portions of such meeting or conference relating to the Merger
and to have access to and be consulted in connection with any document,
opinion or proposal made or submitted to any Governmental Entity in
connection with any such proceeding.

(b) _FCC Filings_. Each of Parent and the Company covenants and agrees to act
diligently and use reasonable best efforts to prepare and file, as promptly as
possible, but in no event later than ten (10) business days after the date
hereof (it being understood that the failure to file within such ten (10)
business day period shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement so long as
the filing is made as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter), all
necessary applications and notices in order to obtain the FCC
Consent (collectively, the " _FCC Transfer Applications_ "). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates
shall make any filing with the FCC that could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Transferred Spectrum Assets, the transactions
contemplated hereby or obtaining the FCC Consent or consent to the FCC
Transfer Applications. The FCC Transfer Applications and any supplemental
information furnished in connection therewith shall be in substantial
compliance with the FCC Rules, and shall contain such showings, information
and requests for waivers as shall be appropriate. The Company and Parent shall
furnish to each other such necessary information and reasonable assistance
as the other may reasonably request in connection with the preparation,
filing and prosecution of each FCC Transfer Application and shall furnish the
FCC any documents, materials, or other information reasonably requested by the
FCC. Parent and the Company shall bear their own expenses in connection with
the preparation, filing, and prosecution of each FCC Transfer Application;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all filing fees incurred in connection therewith
shall be borne one-half each by Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand. In the event that any information in the FCC Transfer
Applications or any such supplemental information furnished in connection
therewith is deemed confidential by Parent or the Company, the parties shall
use their reasonable best efforts to maintain the

 



-39-  confidentiality of the same, and the parties shall seek FCC authorization to
withhold such information from public view. Parent and the Company shall, and
shall each cause its respective Affiliates to, consult and cooperate with one
another to the full extent permissible under applicable Law in connection with
any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion
or proposal made or submitted in connection with any proceeding under or
relating to the FCC Transfer Applications.

(c) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and
use (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective
reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under this Agreement, the Note Purchase Agreements and applicable Laws
to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreements as soon as
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable
all documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings
and to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations,
approvals, permits, clearances, and authorizations necessary or advisable to
be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to
consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreements. Any costs necessary for the
Company or its Subsidiaries to pay to obtain any consents, approvals or
authorizations obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby shall paid prior to the Effective Time.

(d) _Parent Actions_. Nothing in this _Section 5.7_ shall require, or be
construed to require, (i) Parent, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates to take or refrain from taking any action or to agree to any
restriction or condition with respect to any of their assets or operations, in
each case that would take effect prior to the Effective Time or (ii) Parent or
its Affiliates to take or refrain from taking any action or to agree to any
restriction or condition with respect to (A) the operations or assets of
Parent or any of its Affiliates or (B) the operations or assets of the Company
or the Companys Subsidiaries ((A) and (B) each being a " _Regulatory Adverse
Condition_ "). Parent agrees that the imposition of any of the conditions set
forth on _Exhibit 5.7(e)_ will not be deemed a Regulatory Adverse Condition to
the extent set forth in such Exhibit. The Company shall not be permitted to
agree to any actions, restrictions or conditions with respect to obtaining any
consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of Parent. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange
of information, Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in
advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, all of
the information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and
any of their respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. To the extent permitted by Law, each party shall provide the other
with copies of all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and any
Governmental Entity relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and, to the extent reasonably practicable, all telephone calls and
meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall include representatives of Parent and the Company. In
exercising the foregoing rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act
reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

 



-40-  (e) _Correspondence_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company
shall (i) promptly deliver to Parent copies of all correspondence between it
(or its advisors) and the FCC, Industry Canada, the NPT or any other
Governmental Entity with respect to any of the filings made pursuant to
_Section 5.7(a)_,  _Section 5.7(b)_ or _Section 5.7(c)_, the Company
Licenses or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, all telephone calls and meetings with a
Governmental Entity regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall include representatives of Parent; and (ii) promptly file with the FCC,
Industry Canada, the NPT or any requesting Governmental Entity a response to
any such notice or inquiry indicated in clause (i) of this _Section 5.7(e)_,
which response shall be reasonably acceptable to the other party.

 

Section 5.8 _Maintain Regulatory Status; Preserve Company Licenses_.

 

(a) _Maintain Regulatory Status_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cure no later
than the Effective Time any material violations and defaults by any of them
under any applicable FCC Rules, Industry Canada Rules, NPT Rules and FAA
Rules, (ii) substantially comply with the terms of any Company Licenses and
the FAA Rules, (iii) file or cause to be filed with the FCC, Industry Canada,
the NPT and the FAA all material reports and other filings required to be
filed by the Company under applicable FCC Rules, Industry Canada Rules, NPT
Rules and FAA Rules, and (iv) preserve intact in all material respects its
goodwill with the FCC, the FAA, Industry Canada, the NPT and the Companys
other regulators.

(b) _Preserve Company Licenses_. During the period from the date of this
Agreement to the Closing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to: (i) use their respective reasonable best efforts to take all actions
reasonably necessary to maintain and preserve the Company Licenses, Company
Leases and Company Permits, including the timely filing of any required FCC
reports and all other applicable Laws with respect thereto; (ii) not enter
into any agreement or negotiations (or continue any negotiations) on or with
respect to Spectrum capacity under any Company License without the prior
consultation with and the prior approval of Parent; (iii) not enter into any
Interference Consent, negotiate for any Interference Consent (or continue any
such negotiations) in connection with any Company License without the prior
consultation with and the prior approval of Parent; (iv) not enter into any
agreement or negotiations (or continue any negotiations) on or with respect
to the assignment of any Company License (other than pursuant hereto), the
partition of any Company License or the disaggregation of any Company License;
(v) except for proceedings related to the Ongoing WCS Rulemaking Proceedings,
not seek the modification of any Company License, except for such
modifications as are authorized by this Agreement and in any such event, the
Company shall consult with Parent prior to seeking such modification; and
(vi) refrain from taking any action that would give the FCC, Industry Canada,
the NPT or any other Governmental Entities with jurisdiction over the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries reasonable grounds to institute proceedings for
the suspension, revocation, termination, forfeiture, cancellation or adverse
modification of any Company Licenses, Company Leases and Company Permits;
provided however that the covenants in the foregoing clauses (ii) through (v)
with respect to Company Licenses that are not Transferred Spectrum Assets will
be applicable only to the extent that such actions would reasonably be likely
to prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



-41-  Section 5.9 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company and
Parent and the members of their respective boards of directors shall grant
such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby, and otherwise act to eliminate
or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent will consult with
and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon any press
release or other public statement or comment prior to the issuance of such
press release or other public statement or comment relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated herein, and shall not issue any such press
release or other public statement or comment prior to such consultation except
with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change or as may be required by Law
or by any national securities exchange.

 

Section 5.11 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to give Parent or the Company, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of the other prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its respective operations.

Section 5.12 _Resignations_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain
the resignations of each director and officer of each Subsidiary of the
Company effective as of the Effective Time.

Section 5.13 _Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to indemnification and
payment or reimbursement of fees and expenses incurred in advance of the final
disposition of any claim related to acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of the
current or former directors or officers, as the case may be (the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), of the Company or its Subsidiaries as provided in
their respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or comparable
organizational documents) as in effect as of the execution of this Agreement
shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time. For a period of six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to (i) maintain in effect the current provisions regarding
indemnification of officers and directors contained in the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of each of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the
Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law against
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including advances
for reasonable fees and 

 



-42-  expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
provided the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines and, subject to approval by
Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any threatened or actual Action
to which such Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be, made a party based
in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining
to (i) the fact that such individual is or was a director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the request of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director or officer of another
person or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby,
whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase a "tail" insurance policy
to provide coverage for a claims period of at least six (6) years with
coverage, amounts, terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties than the Companys existing policies; provided, however,
that the Company shall consult with Parent prior to purchasing such "tail"
insurance policy and shall provide Parent with evidence of such purchase.

(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this  _Section 5.13_, upon learning of any such Action, shall promptly
notify the Surviving Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall
not relieve the Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such
Indemnified Party, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices
the indemnifying party. In the event of any such Action, (arising after the
Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Parties (which acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to
assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there
are issues which raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving
Corporation and the Indemnified Parties, or between the Indemnified Parties,
the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as statements therefor
are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall be
obligated pursuant to this  _Section 5.13(c)_ to pay for only one firm of
counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with a
conflict of interest; provided that the fewest number of counsels necessary
to avoid conflicts of interest shall be used, (ii) the Indemnified Parties
will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) the Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without their
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party
if and to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is
prohibited by applicable Law.

 



-43-  (d) The provisions of this _Section 5.13_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their
heirs and legal representatives.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties and their heirs and legal
representatives under this _Section 5.13_ shall be in addition to any rights
such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate of incorporation or
by-laws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or applicable Law.

(f) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other persons, (ii) transfers fifty percent (50%) or more of its
properties or assets to any person or (iii) enters into any similar
transaction, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 5.13_.

 

Section 5.14 _Delivery of Purchase Price Information_. At least ten (10) and
no more than fifteen (15) business days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall deliver to Parent and to the Holder Representative (as such term
is defined in the Third Lien Note Purchase Agreement) a reasonably detailed
statement (the " _Estimated Liabilities Notice_ "), setting forth both as of
the date delivered and a good faith and reasonable estimate as of the Closing
the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash which constitutes WCS/AWS Assets
held by the Company (" _Unrestricted Cash_ ") and the aggregate amount of
Liabilities of the Company that would appear on the Companys balance sheet,
or would appear if properly recorded, in each case, determined on a
consolidated basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America and consistent with those applied
in the preparation of the audited financial statements included in the
Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Year ended December 31, 2011, in
each case subject to the modifications set forth on _Exhibit D_ (the "
_Accounting Methodologies_ "). The Estimated Liabilities Notice shall also
have set forth on its face both as of the date delivered and a good faith and
reasonable estimate as of the Closing (i) the aggregate amount of such
Liabilities, (ii) the aggregate amount of such Liabilities attributable to the
Notes and (iii) the amount equal to the aggregate amount of such
Liabilities (excluding aggregate amount of such Liabilities attributable to
the Notes) minus Unrestricted Cash (the amount in subclause (iii) calculated
solely with respect to the estimate as of the Closing and as may be revised
pursuant to this  _Section 5.14_, the " _Estimated Closing Date Liabilities_
") and the Company shall provide to Parent all supporting materials used in
such calculations. No later than five business days prior to the Closing,
Parent may by written notice raise any reasonable objections Parent has with
the calculation of the Estimated Closing Date Liabilities. The Company will in
good faith take into account such objection and, to the extent necessary, send
in writing a revised Estimated Liabilities Notice with a revised Estimated
Closing Date Liabilities (revised solely for purposes of taking into account
such objection) no later than three business days prior to the Closing Date
and acceptance by Parent of such revised Estimated Closing Date Liabilities
shall be solely subject to Parent being reasonably satisfied that the
Estimated Closing Date Liabilities have been prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Methodologies. The failure to raise or the raising of any
objection shall not be a waiver of or limit on any rights Parent may otherwise
have.

 



-44-  Section 5.15 _Execution of Transaction Documents_. At or prior to the time
all other conditions to Closing pursuant to _Article VI_ have been satisfied
or waived, (a) the Company shall execute the agreements required to be
delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.3(k)_ and (b) Parent
shall execute the agreements required to be delivered by Parent pursuant to
_Section 6.2(d)_.

Section 5.16 Transfer of Transferred Spectrum Assets, Additional Spectrum
Assets and Other Assets. Promptly following the date hereof, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall transfer the WCS/AWS Assets not held by the Transferred
Entities to the Transferred Entities and the Additional Spectrum Assets and
Other Assets not held by the Excluded Entities to the Excluded Entities, each
as described on _Schedule 5.16(a)_ Section II.A.1. and in the structure
diagram described in _Schedule 5.16(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule
(together, the " _Structure Schedule_ "). Immediately prior to the Closing
(which shall be the date prescribed by _Section 1.2_ hereof and which for
this purpose will not take into account the satisfaction of the condition in
_Section 6.1(c)_), the Company and its Subsidiaries shall transfer the equity
interests in a holding company for the Excluded Entities (" _Spinco_ ") as
described on the Structure Schedule to the holders of the Convertible Notes
in redemption of all of the Convertible Notes (other than those acquired by
Parent on the Closing Date) and Spinco shall assume all Liabilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries not relating solely to the WCS/AWS Assets.
If any assets or Liabilities have not been transferred or assigned prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries,
promptly to execute, acknowledge and deliver any other assurances or documents
or instruments of transfer reasonably requested by the other party hereto and
necessary for the requesting party to facilitate the transfers of assets and
Liabilities contemplated by this _Section 5.16_ or to obtain the benefits of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The definitive
documentation necessary to effectuate the transfers contemplated by the
Structure Schedule shall be subject to Parents consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and shall be agreed upon as soon as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof. Parent and the Company shall
cooperate in good faith (i) to determine whether, after the Effective Date,
any transition services shall be required as a result of the transactions
set forth on the Structure Schedule and (ii) provide for any customary
arrangements related to the administration of businesses following completion
of a carve-out transaction, in each case, as a result of the separation of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Contracts
described in Items 1 through 3 of _Schedule 3.21(a)(y)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule to be terminated or novated without liability to Parent
or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing Date. If
any approval or consent of the NPT is necessary in order to transfer or
otherwise dispose of the Additional Spectrum Assets or Other Assets in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and it appears reasonably
likely that such approval or consent will not be obtained prior to the date
that the Effective Time would otherwise occur then the parties will cooperate
in good faith to attempt to maintain the benefits of such Additional Spectrum
Assets and Other Assets without de minimis cost to the Company and its
Subsidiaries; provided however, if any such necessary approval or consent
shall not have been obtained on a day when the Effective Time could otherwise
occur, the Company shall or shall cause its applicable Subsidiary to abandon,
forfeit and forego the benefits of such Additional Spectrum Assets and Other
Assets and such Additional Spectrum Assets and Other Assets shall not be
included in determining whether the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(c)_
has been satisfied.

 



-45-  Section 5.17 _Stockholders Representative_. Prior to the Effective Time, with
the prior consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Company shall engage a Person to be a
representative of the former holders of the Company Common Stock (the "
_Stockholders Representative_ ") following the Effective Time on customary
terms and conditions. The Company shall cause the Stockholders Representative
to execute and deliver to Parent the CPR Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
all other agreements necessary for the consummation of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to which the Stockholders
Representative is party. If the Stockholders Representative shall fail to
execute and deliver to Parent any such documents, then the Company shall
cause the Stockholders Representative to be removed and shall appoint a
successor Stockholders Representative. Adoption of this Agreement by the
holders of the Company Common Stock shall be deemed to be approval of
the Stockholders Representative by the holders of the Company Common Stock.

Section 5.18 _Debt Documents_. Without limiting the generality of _Section
5.16_:

(a) the Company hereby agrees to amend and restate, amend or enter into, as
applicable, the documents, instruments and agreements listed on _Schedule
5.18_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Debt Documents_ ") promptly
following the date hereof (but in any event within ten (10) business days
after the date hereof). The Company shall not enter into the Debt Documents
unless the Debt Documents contain terms consistent with Exhibit B of the
Forbearance Agreement and other customary terms. None of the Debt
Documents shall be entered into by the Company unless the Debt Documents are
reasonably satisfactory to Parent; provided, that the terms of any Debt
Document will be deemed not to be reasonably satisfactory to Parent if, among
other things, such terms would be likely, to (i) result in any Liability to
Parent or its Subsidiaries (including the Company or its Subsidiaries in any
manner that would affect the transactions with Parent contemplated by this
Agreement, including by indirectly reducing the amount of funds in the Escrow
Account), (ii) prevent, materially impair or delay the ability of the Company
to consummate the Merger or (iii) adversely affect in any respect the
Transferred Spectrum Assets. The Company shall not amend, modify or waive
compliance with any provision of the Debt Documents without the consent of
Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(b) the Company shall promptly deliver to Parent drafts of any Debt Document
exchanged or circulated among the Company (or any of its representatives) and
any Secured Lender (or any of its representatives, including the Holder
Representative (as such term is defined in the Note Purchase Agreements)). The
Company shall provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to comment on
drafts of the Debt Documents exchanged or circulated in accordance with the
preceding sentence and shall consider in good faith any comments submitted by
Parent for incorporation into the Debt Documents.

Section 5.19 _Elimination of Intercompany Items_ To the extent that there are
payables, receivables, Liabilities or other obligations, including Contracts,
between the Transferred Entities, on the one hand, and the Excluded Entities,
on the other hand, all such payables, receivables, Liabilities or other
obligations shall be eliminated on or prior to the Closing Date other than to
the extent expressly provided for herein.

") shall pay upon execution of such agreement the Termination Payment to
Parent and that Parent shall be an express third party beneficiary to such

Agreement under this _Section 7.1(i)_, the Board of Directors (or the
Independent Committee) shall take into account any changes to the terms

Alternative Proposal will be deemed to be a new Company Alternative Proposal
for purposes of this  _Section 7.1(i)_; or

(j) by Parent, if the Debt Documents are not executed and delivered by the
Company and the Secured Lenders party thereto in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement on or prior to the tenth (10th) business day following the date

In the event of termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to this _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall terminate and shall
become void and there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of any
party hereto (except for the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of
this _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ , which shall survive termination of
this Agreement); _provided, however_ , that nothing shall relieve any party
from liability to the other parties to this Agreement for damages resulting
from any willful breach of its obligations under this Agreement.

 



-51-  Section 7.2 _Termination Payment_. Notwithstanding any provision in this
Agreement to the contrary,

(a) if this Agreement is automatically terminated because the Effective Time
has not occurred prior to or on the Termination Date (and no breach by Parent
of its obligations under this Agreement resulted in a failure of a condition
precedent set forth in _Article VI_ ), or terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_ due to a willful breach by the Company, and prior to the
time of either such termination a Company Alternative Proposal shall have been
made and is not (x) withdrawn at least twenty (20) days prior to such
termination or (y) rejected affirmatively in writing by the Company
(accompanied by a written request to withdraw such Company Alternative
Proposal) prior to such termination, and if concurrently with or within
eighteen (18) months after such termination of this Agreement, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement reflecting a Qualifying
Transaction with any Person other than Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or a
Qualifying Transaction shall have been consummated, then the Company shall pay
to Parent within two (2) business days after such entry or consummation by
wire transfer of immediately-available funds to an account previously
specified by Parent an amount equal to the Termination Payment (for purposes
of this Agreement the term " _Termination Payment_ " shall mean an amount
equal to a termination fee in the amount of $5,000,000, provided that in the
case of the preceding clause (y), the Termination Payment shall be payable
despite such written rejection in writing if, prior to the date that is
twenty (20) days following the date of such termination, the Company takes any
action that would violate _Section 5.3(a)_ with respect to such Company
Alternative Proposal or any other proposal that would have constituted a
Company Alternative Proposal is received from (A) the party making the

or after the fifteenth (15th) business day after the date of this Agreement
and concurrently with or within eighteen (18) months after such termination of

Qualifying Transaction with any Person other than Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or a Qualifying Transaction shall have been consummated, then the
Company shall pay to Parent within two (2) business days after such entry or
consummation, by wire transfer of immediately-available funds to an account
previously specified by Parent an amount equal to the Termination Payment.

(c) If this Agreement is to be terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(i)_, the Termination Payment shall be paid by the Alternative Acquiror by
wire transfer of immediately-available funds to an account previously
specified by Parent.

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this  _Section
7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount
due pursuant to this _Section 7.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for the fee set forth in this _Section 7.2_ or any portion of such
fee, the Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub its costs and expenses
(including attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in

payment was required to be made through the date of payment.

completion of such transaction (without regard to any of their holdings in the
acquiring company) cease to hold at least fifty and one-tenth percent (50.1%)
of the shares of Company Common Stock.

material respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other
obligation of the Company under the Merger Agreement.

Section 2.2 Grant of Irrevocable Proxy. If requested by Parent, the
Stockholder shall appoint Parent and any designee of Parent, and each of them
individually, as the Stockholders proxy, with full power of substitution and
resubstitution, to vote during the Voting Period with respect to any and all
of the Subject Shares on the matters and in the manner specified in _Section

such proxy. The Stockholder affirms that any irrevocable proxy given by it
with respect to the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby shall be given to Parent by the Stockholder to secure
the performance of the obligations of the Stockholder under this Agreement. It
is agreed that Parent (and its officers on behalf of Parent) will use the
irrevocable proxy that may be granted by the Stockholder only in accordance
with applicable Law and only if the Stockholder fails to comply with _Section
2.1_ and that, to the extent Parent (and its officers on behalf of Parent)
uses any such irrevocable proxy, it will only vote the Subject Shares subject
to such irrevocable proxy with respect to the matters specified in, and in
accordance with the provisions of, _Section 2.1_.

Section 2.3 Nature of Irrevocable Proxy. Any proxy granted pursuant to
_Section 2.2_ to Parent by the Stockholder shall be irrevocable during the
term of this Agreement, shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable proxy and shall revoke any and all
prior proxies granted by the Stockholder. Any proxy that may be granted
hereunder shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.

manner set forth in this Agreement.

 



-6-  (b) Parent hereby appoints [] as the Rights Agent to act as rights agent for
Parent in accordance with the instructions hereinafter set forth in this
Agreement, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment.

 

Section 2.2 Nontransferable.

any other manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part, other than
through a Permitted Transfer.

Address.

 

(a) The CPRs shall not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument.

 

(b) The Rights Agent shall keep a register (the " _CPR Register_ ") for the
registration of CPRs in a book-entry position for each CPR Holder. The CPR
Register shall set forth the name and address of each Holder, and the number
of CPRs held by such Holder and Tax Identification Number of each Holder. Each
of Parent and the Stockholders Representative may receive and inspect a copy
of the CPR Register, from time to time, upon written request made to the CPR
Registrar. Within five (5) Business Days after receipt of such request, the
CPR Registrar shall deliver a copy of the CPR Register, as then in effect, to
Parent and the Stockholders Representative at the address set forth in
_Section 6.1_. The Rights Agent is hereby initially appointed "CPR Registrar"

(c) Subject to the restrictions set forth in _Section 2.2_, every request
made to transfer a CPR must be in writing and accompanied by a written
instrument or instruments of transfer and any other requested documentation in
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the CPR Registrar, duly executed by

proper form and the transfer otherwise complies with the other terms and
conditions herein, register the transfer of the CPRs in the CPR Register. All
duly transferred CPRs registered in the CPR Register shall be the valid
obligations of Parent, evidencing the same rights and entitling the
transferee to the same benefits and rights under this Agreement as those held
by the transferor. No transfer of a CPR shall be valid until registered in the
CPR Register, and any transfer not duly registered in the CPR Register will
be void ab initio. Any transfer or assignment of the CPRs shall be without
charge (other than the cost of any transfer Tax which shall be the
responsibility of the transferor) to the Holder.

 

(d) A Holder may make a written request to the CPR Registrar to change such
Holders address of record in the CPR Register. The written request must be

Agent for a list containing the names, addresses and number of CPRs of the
Holders that are registered in the CPR Register. Within five (5) Business Days
following the date of receipt by the Rights Agent of such request, the CPR
Registrar shall deliver a copy of such list to the Stockholders
Representative.

Section 2.4 Payment Procedures.

 

Within two (2) Business Days following its receipt of a CPR Payment Amount

bank information has been provided in writing to the Rights Agent with wire
transfer instructions on or prior to the date referred to in immediately
preceding clause (x) above, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
such account. Subsequent payments will require new wire instructions be
provided within each such payment notice received by the Escrow Agent.

The Rights Agent shall deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or
withheld, from each CPR Payment Amount otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement, the amounts, if any, that Parent is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code; provided that in
determining the required amount to be withheld, the Rights Agent will give
effect to any properly presented form (e.g., Form W-8 or W-9 as applicable)
eliminating or reducing the amount required to be withheld. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant
Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Holder in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

To the extent permitted by applicable law, the parties agree to treat the
payments made under this Agreement as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

Section 2.5 Parent Losses  Procedures for Third Party Claims.

Partys receipt of a Third Party Claim, notify the Stockholders Representative
in writing of such Third Party Claim, the amount or the estimated amount of

In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall
for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any

other provisions of this Agreement, but this Agreement shall be construed as
if such invalid or illegal or unenforceable provision had never
been contained herein. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the court or other tribunal
making such determination is authorized and instructed to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as

ARTICLE I __

_STOCKHOLDERS_

 

Section 1.1 _Annual Meetings_. An annual meeting of stockholders shall be held
for the election of directors at such date, time and place either within or
without the State of Delaware as may be designated by the Board of Directors
from time to time. Any other proper business may be transacted at the annual
meeting.

 

Section 1.2 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of stockholders may be called
at any time by the Chairman of the Board, if any, the Vice Chairman of the
Board, if any, the President or the Board of Directors, to be held at such
date, time and place either within or without the State of Delaware as may be
stated in the notice of the meeting. A special meeting of stockholders shall
be called by the Secretary upon the written request, stating the purpose of
the meeting, of stockholders who together own of record a majority of the
outstanding shares of each class of stock entitled to vote at such meeting. 

Section 1.3 _Notice of Meetings_. Whenever stockholders are required or
permitted to take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting
shall be given which shall state the place, date and hour of the meeting, and,
in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the
meeting is called. Unless otherwise provided by law, the written notice of
any meeting shall be given not less than ten nor more than sixty days before
the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting.
If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the
United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such
stockholders address as it appears on the records of the Corporation.

Section 1.4 _Adjournments_. Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special,
may be adjourned from time to time, to reconvene at the same or some other
place, and notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time
and place thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.

 

Section 1.5 _Quorum_. At each meeting of stockholders, except where otherwise
provided by law or the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the
holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote on a
matter at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum of the holders of any class
of stock entitled to vote on a matter, the holders of such class so present or
represented may, by majority vote, adjourn the meeting of such class from time
to time in the manner 

 



-1-   provided by Section 1.4 of these by-laws until a quorum of such class shall
be so present or represented. Shares of its own capital stock belonging on the
record date for the meeting to the Corporation or to another corporation, if
a majority of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such
other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall
neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; _provided,
however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation to
vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held by it in a
fiduciary capacity.

 

Section 1.6 _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by
the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the Chairman of the
Board by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the Vice
Chairman of the Board by the President, or in the absence of the President by
a Vice President, or in the absence of the foregoing persons by a chairman
designated by the Board of Directors, or in the absence of such designation by
a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary, or in the absence of the
Secretary an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the meeting, but
in the absence of the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary the chairman of
the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.

The order of business at each such meeting shall be as determined by the
chairman of the meeting. The chairman of the meeting shall have the right and
authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to do all
such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper conduct of
the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of procedures
for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time allotted to
questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation, restrictions on entry
to such meeting after the time prescribed for the commencement thereof and the
opening and closing of the voting polls.

 

Section 1.7 _Voting; Proxies_. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of
incorporation, each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting of
stockholders shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by
such stockholder which has voting power upon the matter in question. Each
stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express
consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may
authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but
no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date,
unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A duly executed proxy shall be
irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as,
it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable
power, regardless of whether the interest with which it is coupled is an
interest in the stock itself or an interest in the Corporation generally. A
stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not irrevocable by attending the
meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in writing revoking
the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date with the
Secretary of the Corporation. Voting at meetings of stockholders need not be
by written ballot unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares
of all classes of stock entitled to vote thereon present in person or
represented by proxy at such meeting shall so determine. Directors shall be
elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of
directors. In all other matters, unless otherwise provided by law or by the
certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy
at the meeting and entitled to vote on the

 



-2-   subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders. Where a separate vote
by class or classes is required, the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the shares of such class or classes present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting shall be the act of such class or classes,
except as otherwise provided by law or by the certificate of incorporation or
these by-laws.

 

Section 1.8 _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_. In
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice
of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the
Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor
less than ten days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed
by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the
close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given,
or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding
the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of
record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall
apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten days after the date upon
which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the
Board of Directors is required by law, shall be the first date on which a
signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken
is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the
State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of
the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt
requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors and
prior action by the Board of Directors is required by law, the record date
for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in
writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on
which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

 

In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any
change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other
lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record
date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record
date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than sixty days prior
to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.

 



-3-  Section 1.9 _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless
otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation or by law, any action
required by law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders
of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special
meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior
notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth
the action so taken, shall be signed by all holders of outstanding stock and
shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to (a) its registered
office in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified mail or registered
mail, return receipt requested, (b) its principal place of business, or (c) an
officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Every written consent
shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and
no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred
to therein unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated consent delivered
in the manner required by this by-law to the Corporation, written consents
signed by all holders of outstanding stock are delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to (a) its registered office in the State of Delaware by hand or
by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, (b) its principal
place of business, or (c) an officer or agent of the Corporation having
custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are
recorded.

 _BOARD OF DIRECTORS_

Section 2.1 _Powers; Number; Qualifications_. The business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of
Directors, except as may be otherwise provided by law or in the certificate
of incorporation. The Board of Directors shall consist of one or more members,
the number thereof to be determined from time to time by the Board. Directors
need not be stockholders.

 

Section 2.2 _Election; Term of Office; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies_. Each
director shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and
qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Any director may
resign at any time upon written notice to the Board of Directors or to the
President or the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take
effect at the time specified therein, and unless otherwise specified therein
no acceptance of such resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. Any
director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without
cause, by the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an
election of directors. Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of
incorporation or these by-laws, vacancies and newly created directorships
resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors elected by
all of the stockholders having the right to vote as a single class or from any
other cause may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office,
although less than a quorum, or by the sole remaining director. Any director
elected or appointed to fill a vacancy shall hold office until the next annual
meeting of the stockholders and his or her successor is elected and qualified
or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.

 

Section 2.3 _Regular Meetings_. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors may
be held at such places within or without the State of Delaware and at such
times as the Board may from time to time determine, and if so determined
notice thereof need not be given.

 



-4-  Section 2.4 _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may
be held at any time or place within or without the State of Delaware whenever
called by the Chairman of the Board, if any, by the Vice Chairman of the
Board, if any, by the President or by any two directors. Reasonable notice
thereof shall be given by the person or persons calling the meeting.

Section 2.5 _Participation in Meetings by Conference Telephone Permitted_.
Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-
laws, members of the Board of Directors, or any committee designated by the
Board, may participate in a meeting of the Board or of such committee, as the
case may be, by means of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and participation in a meeting pursuant to this by-law shall
constitute presence in person at such meeting.

Section 2.6 _Quorum; Vote Required for Action_. At all meetings of the Board
of Directors one-third of the entire Board shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business. The vote of a majority of the directors present at a
meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board unless the
certificate of incorporation or these by-laws shall require a vote of a
greater number. In case at any meeting of the Board a quorum shall not be
present, the members of the Board present may adjourn the meeting from time to
time until a quorum shall be present.

 

Section 2.7 _Organization_. Meetings of the Board of Directors shall be
presided over by the Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the absence of the
Chairman of the Board by the Vice Chairman of the Board, if any, or in the
absence of the Vice Chairman of the Board by the President, or in their
absence by a chairman chosen at the meeting. The Secretary, or in the absence
of the Secretary an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the
meeting, but in the absence of the Secretary and any Assistant Secretary the
chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the
meeting.

 

Section 2.8 _Action by Directors Without a Meeting_. Unless otherwise
restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or
of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the
Board or of such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing,
and the writing or writings are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the
Board or committee.

Section 2.9  _Compensation of Directors_. Unless otherwise restricted by the
certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, the Board of Directors shall
have the authority to fix the compensation of directors.

 

ARTICLE III __

_COMMITTEES_

Section 3.1 _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. The

 



-5-   Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of
the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a committee,
the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from
voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the
place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the
extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors or in these by-
laws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or
authority in reference to the following matters: (i) approving or adopting,
or recommending to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required
by law to be submitted to stockholders for approval, (ii) adopting, amending
or repealing these by-laws or (iii) removing or indemnifying directors.

Section 3.2 _Committee Rules_. Unless the Board of Directors otherwise
provides, each committee designated by the Board may adopt, amend and repeal
rules for the conduct of its business. In the absence of a provision by the
Board or a provision in the rules of such committee to the contrary, a
majority of the entire authorized number of members of such committee shall
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business, the vote of a majority of
the members present at a meeting at the time of such vote if a quorum is then
present shall be the act of such committee, and in other respects each
committee shall conduct its business in the same manner as the Board conducts
its business pursuant to Article II of these by-laws.

ARTICLE IV __

_OFFICERS_

 

Section 4.1 _Officers; Election_. As soon as practicable after the annual
meeting of stockholders in each year, the Board of Directors shall elect a
President and a Secretary, and it may, if it so determines, elect from among
its members a Chairman of the Board and a Vice Chairman of the Board. The
Board may also elect one or more Vice Presidents, one or more Assistant Vice
Presidents, one or more Assistant Secretaries, a Treasurer and one or more
Assistant Treasurers and such other officers as the Board may deem desirable
or appropriate and may give any of them such further designations or alternate
titles as it considers desirable. Any number of offices may be held by the
same person unless the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws otherwise
provide.

Section 4.2 _Term of Office; Resignation; Removal; Vacancies_. Unless
otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors electing any
officer, each officer shall hold office until his or her successor is elected
and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Any officer
may resign at any time upon written notice to the Board or to the President or
the Secretary of the Corporation. Such resignation shall take effect at the
time specified therein, and unless otherwise specified therein no acceptance
of such resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The Board may
remove any officer with or without cause at any time. Any such removal
shall be without prejudice to the contractual rights of such officer, if any,
with the Corporation, but the election of an officer shall not of itself
create contractual rights. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the
Corporation by death, resignation, removal or otherwise may be filled by the
Board at any regular or special meeting.

 



-6-  Section 4.3 _Powers and Duties_. All officers of the Corporation shall have
such powers and duties in the management of the Corporation as shall be
stated in these by-laws or in a resolution of the Board of Directors.

ARTICLE V __

_STOCK_

 

Section 5.1 _Certificates_. Every holder of stock in the Corporation shall be
entitled to have a certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by
the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors, if any, or the
President or a Vice President, and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer,
or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, of the Corporation, representing
the number of shares of stock in the Corporation owned by such holder. If such
certificate is manually signed by one officer or manually countersigned by a
transfer agent or by a registrar, any other signature on the certificate may
be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has
signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall
have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the
date of issue.

Section 5.2 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New
Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock in the
place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate, or such owners legal representative, to give
the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may
be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any
such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated
shares.

 

ARTICLE VI __

_MISCELLANEOUS_

Section 6.1 _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be
determined by the Board of Directors.

Section 6.2 _Seal_. The Corporation may have a corporate seal which shall
have the name of the Corporation inscribed thereon and shall be in such form
as may be approved from time to time by the Board of Directors. The corporate
seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed or
affixed or in any other manner reproduced.

Section 6.3 _Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and
Committees_. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws, a written
waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice.
Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
such meeting,

 



-7-   except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business
to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
stockholders, directors or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by
the certificate of incorporation or these by-laws.

Section 6.4 _Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees_. The
Corporation shall indemnify to the full extent permitted by law any person
made or threatened to be made a party to any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the
fact that such person or such persons testator or intestate is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Corporation or serves or served at the
request of the Corporation any other enterprise as a director, officer or
employee. Expenses, including attorneys fees, incurred by any such person in
defending any such action, suit or proceeding shall be paid or reimbursed by
the Corporation promptly upon receipt by it of an undertaking of such person
to repay such expenses if it shall ultimately be determined that such person
is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation. The rights provided to
any person by this by-law shall be enforceable against the Corporation by such
person who shall be presumed to have relied upon it in serving or continuing
to serve as a director, officer or employee as provided above. No amendment of
this by-law shall impair the rights of any person arising at any time with
respect to events occurring prior to such amendment. For purposes of this by-
law, the term "Corporation" shall include any predecessor of the Corporation
and any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent)
absorbed by the Corporation in a consolidation or merger; the term "other
enterprise" shall include any corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or employee benefit plan; service "at the request of the Corporation" shall
include service as a director, officer or employee of the Corporation which
imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer or employee
with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries;
any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan
shall be deemed to be indemnifiable expenses; and action by a person with
respect to an employee benefit plan which such person reasonably believes to
be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of such plan shall be
deemed to be action not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation.

Section 6.5 _Interested Directors; Quorum_. No contract or transaction
between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or
between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association or
other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are
directors or officers, or have a financial interest, shall be void or
voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or officer is
present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors or
committee thereof which authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely
because his or her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (1) the
material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board or the
committee, and the Board or committee in good faith authorizes the contract or
transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested
directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than a quorum;
or (2) the material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to
the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the stockholders
entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or transaction is specifically
approved in good faith by vote of the stockholders; or (3) the contract or
transaction is fair as to

 



-8-   the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified, by
the Board, a committee thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested
directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting
of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or
transaction.

 

Section 6.6 _Form of Records_. Any records maintained by the Corporation in
the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of
account and minute books, may be kept on, or be in the form of, punch cards,
magnetic tape, photographs, microphotographs or any other information storage
device, provided that the records so kept can be converted into
clearly legible form within a reasonable time. The Corporation shall so
convert any records so kept upon the request of any person entitled to inspect
