AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of February 19, 2013 (this
"Agreement"), between F.N.B. CORPORATION, a Florida corporation ("FNB"), and
PVF CAPITAL CORP., an Ohio corporation ("PVFC").

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of PVFC and FNB have determined that it is in
the best interests of their respective companies and their shareholders to
consummate the strategic business combination transaction provided for in
this Agreement pursuant to which PVFC will, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with and into FNB (the
"Merger"), so that FNB is the surviving company in the Merger (sometimes
referred to in such capacity as the "Surviving Company"); and

WHEREAS, for federal income Tax (as defined in Section 3.10(b)) purposes, it
is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a reorganization under the
provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), and the regulations of the U.S. Department of the Treasury
promulgated thereunder (as such regulations may be amended from time to time,
including corresponding provisions of successor rules and regulations thereto,
the "Treasury Regulations"); and

 

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties
agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the
Ohio General Corporation Law (the "OGCL") and the Florida Business Corporation
Act (the "FBCA"), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) PVFC
shall merge with and into FNB. FNB shall be the Surviving Company in the
Merger, and shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State
of Florida. As of the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
PVFC shall cease.

1.2 _Effective Time_.

 

The Merger shall become effective as set forth in the certificate of merger
and the articles of merger (each, the "Articles of Merger") that shall be
filed with the Secretary of State of the

 



 

- 1 \-  State of Ohio and the Secretary of State of the State of Florida on or
before the Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.1). The term "Effective Time"
shall mean the date and time when the Merger becomes effective as set forth
in the Articles of Merger. "Effective Date" shall mean the date on which the
Effective Time occurs.

1.3 _Effects of the Merger_.

(a) _Effects Under OGCL and FBCA_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 1701.82 of the OGCL and
Section 607.1106 of the FBCA.

(b) _Directors and Executive Officers of the Surviving Company_. The directors
of the Surviving Company immediately after the Merger shall be the directors
of FNB immediately prior to the Merger. The executive officers of the
Surviving Company immediately after the Merger shall be the executive officers
of FNB immediately prior to the Merger.

(c) _Principal Office_. The location of the principal office of the Surviving
Company in the State of Florida is 2150 Goodlette Road North, 8th Floor,
Naples, Florida 34102.

 

(d) _Consent to Service_. As the Surviving Company, FNB hereby consents to be
sued and served with process in the State of Ohio and irrevocably appoints of
the Secretary of State of the State of Ohio as its agent to accept service of
process in any proceeding in the State of Ohio to enforce against the
Surviving Company any obligation of PVFC or to enforce the rights of
a dissenting shareholder of PVFC.

1.4 _Conversion of PVFC Common Shares_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each common share, par value
$0.01 per share, of PVFC ("PVFC Common Shares") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Treasury Shares (as
defined in Section 1.4(b)) shall, by virtue of the Merger, no longer be
outstanding and shall as of the Effective Time automatically be
converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive as merger
consideration 0.3405 shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, $0.01 par
value, of FNB ("FNB Common Stock") (the "Merger Consideration"). 

(b) At and after the Effective Time, each Treasury Share shall be cancelled
and retired and no shares of FNB Common Stock or other consideration shall be
issued in exchange therefor. "Treasury Shares" means the PVFC Common Shares
held by PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1(c)) or
by FNB or any of its Subsidiaries, other than in a fiduciary, including
custodial or agency, capacity or as a result of debts previously contracted in
good faith.

(c) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of PVFC shall be closed
as to holders of PVFC Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
and no transfer of PVFC Common Shares by any such holder shall thereafter be
made or recognized. If, after the Effective Time, certificates representing
PVFC Common Shares ("Certificates") are properly presented in accordance with
Section 2.2 of this Agreement to the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section
2.1), such Certificates shall be cancelled and exchanged for FNB Common Stock
held in

 



 

- 2 \-  book entry representing the number of whole shares into which the PVFC
Common Shares represented by the Certificates was converted in the Merger,
plus, if applicable pursuant to Section 1.4(e), any payment for any
fractional share of FNB Common Stock without any interest thereon and any
dividends or distributions to which the holder of such Certificates is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b).

 

(d) Each holder of PVFC Common Shares shall have the option of enrolling the
whole shares of FNB Common Stock issuable to such shareholder upon the
consummation of the Merger in FNBs Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock
Purchase Plan (the "DRSP Plan"). Each PVFC shareholder electing to enroll in
the DRSP Plan shall be issued FNB Common Stock held in book entry
representing the number of whole shares received in the Merger.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
PVFC Common Shares who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fractional
share of FNB Common Stock, after taking into account all Certificates
delivered by such holder, shall receive an amount in cash, without
interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (a) the Average Closing Price (as defined below) as of the Closing
Date by (b) the fraction of a share (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth
when expressed in decimal form) of FNB Common Stock, to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends or
other rights in respect of any such fractional shares. "Average Closing Price"
means, as of any specified date, the average composite closing price of FNB
Common Stock as reported by the NYSE for each of the twenty (20) consecutive
trading days ending on and including the fifth such trading day prior to the
specified date rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth.

outstanding option to purchase PVFC Common Shares (each a "PVFC Stock
Option"), pursuant to the equity-based compensation plans identified on

hereof) (the "PVFC Stock Plans") and the award agreements evidencing the
grants thereunder, granted to any current or former employee or director of
PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 3.1(c)) shall at
the Effective Time cease to represent a right to acquire PVFC Common Shares
and shall be converted automatically into an option to acquire shares of FNB
Common Stock on the terms hereinafter set forth. FNB shall assume each such
PVFC Stock Option in accordance with the terms of the relevant PVFC Stock
Plan and stock option or other agreement by which it is evidenced, except that
from and after the Effective Time: (i) FNB and the Compensation Committee of
its Board of Directors, including, if applicable, the entire Board of
Directors of FNB, shall be substituted for PVFC and the Compensation Committee
of the Board of Directors of PVFC, including, if applicable, the entire Board
of Directors of PVFC, administering such PVFC Stock Plan, (ii) each PVFC
Stock Option assumed by FNB may be exercised solely for shares of FNB Common
Stock, (iii) the number of shares of FNB Common Stock subject to such PVFC
Stock Option shall be equal to the number 

 



 

- 3 \-  of PVFC Common Shares subject to such PVFC Stock Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, provided that, unless
otherwise provided for in such PVFC Stock Option, any fractional shares of
FNB Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to
the nearest share, and (iv) the exercise price per share of FNB Common Stock
under each such option shall be the amount (rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) equal to the per share exercise price under each such PVFC Stock Option
prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio. Notwithstanding
clauses (iii) and (iv) of the preceding sentence, each PVFC Stock Option that
is an "incentive stock option" shall be adjusted as required by Section 424 of
the Code, and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, so as not to
constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the option within the
meaning of Section 424(h) of the Code. FNB and PVFC agree to take all
reasonable and necessary steps to effect the provisions of this Section
1.6(a). As of the Effective Time, FNB shall issue to each holder of each
outstanding PVFC Stock Option that has been assumed by FNB a document
evidencing the conversion and assumption of such PVFC Stock Option by FNB
pursuant to this Section 1.6(a).

(b) _PVFC Share Awards_. At the Effective Time, each holder of any then
outstanding restricted share awards relating to PVFC Common Shares, including
those designated as performance share awards (each, a "PVFC Share Award"),
shall be entitled to receive a number of shares of FNB Common Stock equal to
the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the total number of PVFC Common Shares
subject to such PVFC Share Award (provided that any fractional shares of FNB
Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be rounded down to the
nearest share), subject to any applicable tax withholding requirements.
Notwithstanding anything that may be to the contrary in this
subparagraph (b), each PVFC Share Award shall remain subject to any
applicable restrictions, vesting and other terms and conditions unless
otherwise provided in the award agreement evidencing such PVFC Share Award or
the relevant PVFC Stock Plan.

a PVFC Warrant shall be entitled to receive from FNB, in consideration of the
cancellation of the PVFC Warrant held by such warrant holder, an amount in
cash, without interest, rounded to the nearest cent, equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (a) the difference between (i) the product of the
Exchange Ratio and the Average Closing Price as of the Closing Date, and (ii)
One Dollar and Seventy-Five Cents ($1.75), times (b) the number of shares
PVFC Common Shares that were purchasable pursuant to such PVFC Warrant
immediately before the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, any
such cancelled PVFC Warrant shall no longer be exercisable by the former
holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment specified
in this Section 1.7. The amount payable under this Section 1.7 shall be
subject to any applicable tax withholding requirements.

 

1.8 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Company_. The FNB

Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in

effecting the combination contemplated by this Agreement if and to the extent

ARTICLE 2

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 _FNB to Make Merger Consideration Available_. 

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, FNB shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with Registrar and Transfer Company
("Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article 2, (i) book entry shares representing
the aggregate number of shares of FNB Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement in exchange for PVFC Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger, (ii) immediately available funds equal to
any dividends or distributions payable in accordance with Section 2.2(b)(i),
and (iii) cash in lieu of any fractional shares of FNB Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to Section 1.4(e) and paid pursuant to Section 1.4 in exchange
for outstanding PVFC Common Shares (such cash and book entry shares for
shares of FNB Common Stock, collectively being referred to as the "Exchange
Fund").

 



 

- 5 \- (b) All amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.7 to the holders of the PVFC
Warrants shall be paid by the Surviving Company at the Effective Time or, if
it is not practicable to make such payments at the Effective Time, no later
than the fifth (5th) business day following the Effective Time, and may be
withheld until a written acknowledgement, in a form mutually agreed to by FNB
and PVFC prior to the Closing, is obtained from the holder of such PVFC
Warrant to the effect that (i) the payment contemplated by Section 1.7 will
satisfy in full the Surviving Companys and FNBs obligation to such person
pursuant to such PVFC Warrant, and (ii) subject to the payment of the same,
such PVFC Warrant shall, without any action on the part of the Surviving
Company, FNB or PVFC or the holder thereof, be deemed terminated, cancelled,
void and of no further force or effect as between the Surviving Company or
PVFC, on the one hand, and the holder thereof, on the other, and none of them
shall have any further rights or obligations with respect thereto.

 

2.2 _Exchange Shares_.

(a) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of PVFC Common Shares a letter of transmittal in
customary form as prepared by FNB and reasonably acceptable to PVFC which
shall specify, among other things, that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the PVFC Common Shares
represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement and any dividends or distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). After the Effective Time of the
Merger, each holder of a Certificate formerly representing PVFC Common Shares,
other than Treasury Shares, who surrenders or has surrendered such
Certificate or customary affidavits and indemnification regarding the loss or
destruction of such Certificate, together with duly executed transmittal
materials to the Exchange Agent, shall, upon acceptance thereof, be entitled
to: (i) book entry shares representing FNB Common Stock into which the PVFC
Common Shares shall have been converted pursuant to Section 1.4, (ii) any cash
in lieu of any fractional share of FNB Common Stock to which such holder
would otherwise be entitled and (iii) any dividends or distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). The Exchange Agent shall
accept such Certificate upon compliance with such reasonable and customary
terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an orderly
exchange thereof in accordance with normal practices. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate representing PVFC Common
Shares shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time of the Merger to
evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu
of fractional shares into which the PVFC Common Shares represented by such
Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.2(b). FNB shall not be obligated to deliver the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or any declared but
unpaid dividends to which any former holder of PVFC Common Shares is entitled
as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders his Certificate or
Certificates for exchange as provided in Section 2.2. If any shares of FNB
Common Stock, or any cash in lieu of fractional shares and/or declared but
unpaid dividends, is to be issued in a name other than that in which a
Certificate surrendered for exchange is issued, the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such exchange shall

 



 

- 6 \-  affix any requisite stock transfer tax stamps to the Certificate surrendered
or provide funds for their purchase or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such taxes are not payable. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to FNB, of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
FNB or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount
as FNB and the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it, FNB or the
Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(b) Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the
record holder of the whole shares of FNB Common Stock issued in exchange
therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the amount of
any dividends or distributions, if any, with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that have been declared by PVFC in respect of PVFC Common
Shares after the date of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, (ii) at the time of
such surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share
of FNB Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
1.4(e) and the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time of the Merger and which had become payable with
respect to such whole shares of FNB Common Stock prior to the time of
surrender, and (iii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends
or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time of the
Merger but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender
payable with respect to such whole shares of FNB Common Stock.

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of PVFC of the PVFC Common Shares that were issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to settle
transfers of PVFC Common Shares that occurred prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to FNB for any
reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.
All shares of FNB Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB
Common Stock and/or declared but unpaid dividends issued or paid upon the
surrender for exchange of PVFC Common Shares (or the provision of customary
affidavits and indemnification for lost or mutilated Certificates in
accordance with the terms hereof) and the letter of transmittal, shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such PVFC Common Shares.

 

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund, including any interest thereon, that
remains undistributed to the shareholders of PVFC following the passage of
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered
to FNB, upon demand, and any shareholders of PVFC who have not theretofore
complied with this Section 2.2 shall thereafter look only to FNB for payment
of their claim for FNB Common Stock, and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of FNB Common Stock and any unpaid dividends or distributions payable in
accordance with Section 2.2(b).

 

(e) Neither PVFC nor FNB shall be liable to any holder of PVFC Common Shares
or FNB Common Stock, as the case may be, for such shares, any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 



 

- 7 \- (f) The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of
ownership with respect to the shares of FNB Common Stock held by it from time
to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold all dividends or
other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such shares of FNB
Common Stock for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.

2.3 _Adjustments for Dilution and Other Matters_. If prior to the Effective
Time of the Merger, (a) FNB shall declare a stock dividend or distribution on
FNB Common Stock with a record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger,
or subdivide, split up, reclassify or combine FNB Common Stock, or make a
distribution other than a regular quarterly cash dividend, on FNB Common
Stock in any security convertible into FNB Common Stock, in each case with a
record date prior to the Effective Time of the Merger, or (b) the outstanding
shares of FNB Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased, changed into
or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities in each
case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification,
stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar change in
FNBs capitalization other than a business combination transaction with
another bank holding company or financial services company, then a
proportionate adjustment or adjustments will be made to the Exchange Ratio
and, as applicable, the Average Closing Price, which adjustment may include,
as appropriate, the issuance of securities, property or cash on the same basis
as that on which any of the foregoing shall have been issued, distributed or
paid to holders of such class of FNB Common Stock generally.

2.4 _Withholding Rights_. The Exchange Agent or, subsequent to the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, FNB, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of FNB Common Stock, cash
dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b) and any other
cash amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
PVFC Common Shares such amounts as the Exchange Agent or FNB, as the case may
be, is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law, with respect to the making of such payment.
To the extent the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent or FNB, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of PVFC Common Shares in respect
of whom such deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or FNB,
as the case may be.

- 15 \-  against in accordance with GAAP. All required estimated Tax payments

of the PVFC Subsidiaries has granted any extension or waiver of the limitation

taxation by that jurisdiction. All deficiencies asserted or assessments made

common parent of which was PVFC, or (B) has any liability for the Taxes of any
Person, other than PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries, under Treas. Reg.
§1.1502-6, or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law, or as a
transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise. Neither PVFC nor any of the

to such PVFC Benefit Plans, including, without limitation, Code Section 409A.
Each PVFC Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in
accordance with its terms. There are not now, nor do any circumstances exist
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to, any requirement for the
posting of security with respect to any PVFC Benefit Plan or the imposition
of any material lien on the assets of PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries
under ERISA or the Code. Section 3.11(d) of the PVFC Disclosure Schedule
identifies each PVFC Benefit Plan that is intended to be a "qualified plan"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (the "PVFC Qualified Plans").
The IRS has issued a favorable determination letter with respect to each PVFC
Qualified Plan and the related trust which has not been revoked, or PVFC is
entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by the IRS. To the knowledge of
PVFC, there are no existing circumstances and no events have occurred that
would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
PVFC Qualified Plan or the related trust. None of PVFC and the PVFC
Subsidiaries nor any other Person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any
"prohibited transaction", as defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA, which would reasonably be expected to subject PVFC, any of the

or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer
Plan"), (ii) none of PVFC and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or
been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer
Plan and (iii) none of PVFC and the PVFC Subsidiaries nor any of
their respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred, during the last six years,
any Withdrawal Liability that has not been satisfied in full. There does not
now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably be likely to
result in, any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of PVFC
or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such
liabilities that arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the PVFC Benefit
Plans or PVFC Employment Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither PVFC nor any of the PVFC Subsidiaries, nor, to PVFCs
knowledge, any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any
transaction described in Sections 4069, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. 

(g) Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(g) of the PVFC Disclosure Schedule,
PVFC and the PVFC Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical or
other welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents

- 19 \- (h) Except as disclosed in Section 3.11(h) of the PVFC Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions this Agreement contemplates will, either alone or in
conjunction with any other event, whether contingent or otherwise, (i) result
in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be
provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of PVFC or any
of the PVFC Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or
compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the acceleration
of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or compensation
including deferred compensation, or (iv) result in any amount failing to be
deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or additional tax under Section 409A
of the Code.

 

(i) PVFC has delivered or made available to FNB a true and complete list of
the names, corporate and functional titles, hire dates, incentive
compensation, profit sharing and bonuses paid in 2011, 2012 and 2013, full or
part-time status, 2013 annual salaries or hourly rates of all employees of
PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries ("PVFC Employees") as of the date hereof
and, with respect to any PVFC Employee on a leave of absence or otherwise not
actively employed ("Inactive PVFC Employees"), the date on which each such
Inactive PVFC Employee is expected to return to active employment. Except as
otherwise set forth on Section 3.11(i) of the PVFC Disclosure Schedule, (i)
none of the PVFC Employees has a contract of employment with PVFC or any of
the PVFC Subsidiaries, (ii) all PVFC Employees are employees "at will" whose
employment is terminable without liability therefor and (iii) none of the PVFC
Employees has a contract with PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries relating to
stay bonuses, retention or stay payments, severance pay or benefits or other

Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and
there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking
a representation proceeding presently pending or, to PVFCs knowledge,
threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board.
Each of PVFC and the PVFC Subsidiaries is in material compliance with all
applicable Laws respecting employment and employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment, wages and hours and occupational safety and health.

(k) There is no PVFC Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code and there has not been
any such plan since January 1, 2005. No payment pursuant to any arrangement
between PVFC, any of the PVFC Subsidiaries and any "service provider" (as such
term is defined in Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder) would subject any person to a tax pursuant to 409A of the Code,
whether pursuant to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or otherwise.

3.12 _Compliance with Applicable Law_. PVFC and each of the PVFC Subsidiaries
are not in default in any material respect under any Law applicable to PVFC
or any of PVFC Subsidiaries, including but not limited to, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by
Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorist (USA
Patriot) Act of 2001, the Bank Secrecy Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform

 



 

- 20 \-  and Consumer Protection Act, Regulation O, and applicable limits on loans to
one borrower, except where such noncompliance or default is not reasonably
likely to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect on PVFC. PVFC and each of the PVFC Subsidiaries has been and is in
compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance

officers and directors of PVFC who have outstanding loans from PVFC, and
there has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or in
part, any such loan during the two years immediately preceding the date

(a) Each loan, loan commitment, letter of credit or other extension of credit

and each PVFC Subsidiary hold mortgages contained in its loan portfolio for
its own benefit to the extent of its interest shown therein; such mortgages

including the associated loan documents, subject, as of the date of
recordation or filing of applicable security instruments, only to such
exceptions as are discussed in attorneys opinions regarding title or in
title insurance policies in the mortgage files relating to the Loans secured

and all Loans owned by PVFC and each PVFC Subsidiary are with full recourse
to the borrowers, and neither of PVFC nor any PVFC Subsidiary has taken any
action which would reasonably be expected to result in a waiver or negation of
any rights or remedies available against the borrower or guarantor, if any,
on any Loan. All applicable remedies against all borrowers and guarantors are
enforceable except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or
other similar laws affecting creditors rights and except as may be limited
by the exercise of judicial discretion in applying principles of equity.

has committed any breach of trust to PVFCs knowledge with respect to any
fiduciary account and the records for each such fiduciary account are true
and correct and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account.

obligated to contribute, at any time during the six-year period ending on the
date of this Agreement, whether or not written, including without limitation
any employee welfare benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA,

ERISA, whether or not such plan is subject to ERISA, and any bonus, incentive,
deferred compensation, vacation, stock purchase, stock option, equity
compensation, severance, employment, change of control or fringe benefit plan,
program or policy. 

"FNB Employment Agreement" means a contract, offer letter or agreement of FNB
or any of its Subsidiaries with or addressed to any individual who is
rendering or has rendered services thereto as an employee pursuant to which
FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has any actual or contingent liability or
obligation to provide compensation and/or benefits in consideration for past,
present or future services.

(a) Section 4.11(a) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule includes a complete list
of all FNB Benefit Plans and all FNB Employment Agreements.

(b) With respect to each FNB Benefit Plan, FNB has delivered or made

correct and complete copy of each FNB Employment Agreement.

 



 

- 34 \- (c) All contributions required to be made to any FNB Benefit Plan by
applicable Law or by any plan document or other contractual undertaking, and
all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance policies funding any FNB
Benefit Plan, for the period six years prior to and through the date of this
Agreement, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not
required to be made or paid on or before the date of this Agreement, have been
fully reflected on the financial statements to the extent required by GAAP. As
disclosed in Section 4.11(a) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule, each FNB Benefit
Plan that is an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA
either (i) is funded through an insurance company contract and is not a
"welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code or (ii)
is unfunded.

(d) With respect to each FNB Benefit Plan, FNB and its Subsidiaries have
complied, and are in compliance, in all material respects, with all provisions
of ERISA, the Code and all laws and regulations applicable to such FNB Benefit
Plans, including, without limitation, Code Section 409A. Each FNB Benefit
Plan has been administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms. There are not now, nor do any circumstances exist that would reasonably
be expected to give rise to, any requirement for the posting of security with
respect to a FNB Benefit Plan or the imposition of any material lien on the
assets of FNB or any of its Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. Section
4.11(d) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule identifies each FNB Benefit Plan that
is intended to be a "qualified plan" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Code ("FNB Qualified Plans"). The IRS has issued a favorable determination
letter with respect to each FNB Qualified Plan and the related trust which has
not been revoked, or FNB is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by
the IRS. To the knowledge of FNB, there are no existing circumstances and no
events have occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any FNB Qualified Plan or the related trust. To the
knowledge of FNB, none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any other Person,
including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction", as
defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which would
reasonably be expected to subject FNB, any of its Subsidiaries or any Person
that FNB or any of its Subsidiaries has an obligation to indemnify, to any
material Tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502
of ERISA.

(e) No FNB Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA
or Section 412 or 4971 of the Code has failed to satisfy the minimum funding
standards contained in Section 302 of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code. With
respect to such FNB Benefit Plans, except as would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect: (i) the fair market value of the
assets of such FNB Benefit Plan equals or exceeds the actuarial present value
of all accrued benefits under such FNB Benefit Plan, whether or not vested, on
a termination basis, (ii) no reportable event within the meaning of Section
4043(c) of ERISA for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived
has occurred, (iii) all premiums to the PBGC have been timely paid in
full, (iv) no liability, other than for premiums to the PBGC, under Title IV
of ERISA has been or would reasonably be expected to be incurred by FNB or any
of its Subsidiaries and (v) the PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any such FNB Benefit

 



 

- 35 \-  Plan and, to FNBs knowledge, no condition exists that makes it reasonably
likely that such proceedings will be instituted or which would reasonably be
expected to constitute grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA for the
termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to administer, any such FNB
Benefit Plan.

 

(f) (i) No FNB Benefit Plan is a Multiemployer Plan or a Multiple Employer
Plan, (ii) none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has, at any time during the last six years, contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan
and (iii) none of FNB and its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates has incurred, during the last six years, any Withdrawal Liability
that has not been satisfied in full. There does not now exist, nor do any
circumstances exist that would reasonably be expected to result in,
any Controlled Group Liability that would be a liability of FNB or any of its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, other than such liabilities that
arise solely out of, or relate solely to, the FNB Benefit Plans or the FNB
Employment Agreements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
neither FNB nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to FNBs knowledge, any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates, has engaged in any transaction described in
Sections 4069, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA. 

(g) Other than as set forth in Section 4.11(g) of the FNB Disclosure Schedule,
FNB and its Subsidiaries have no liability for life, health, medical or other
welfare benefits to former employees or beneficiaries or dependents thereof,
except for health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the
Code, Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or applicable law and at no expense to FNB
and its Subsidiaries.

(h) Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions this Agreement contemplates will, either
alone or in conjunction with any other event, whether contingent or otherwise,
(i) result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to
be provided, to any director, employee or independent contractor of FNB or
any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase the amount or value of any benefit or
compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any such
director, employee or independent contractor, (iii) result in the
acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any such benefit or
compensation, including deferred compensation, or (iv) result in any amount
failing to be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be
subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or additional tax
under Section 409A of the Code.

(i) No labor organization or group of employees of FNB or any of its
Subsidiaries has made a pending demand for recognition or certification, and
there are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking
a representation proceeding presently pending or, to FNBs knowledge,
threatened to be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board.
Each of FNB and its Subsidiaries is in material compliance with
all applicable Laws and collective bargaining agreements respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages
and hours and occupational safety and health.

breach or default in any material respect under any material contract, lease,
license or other agreement or instrument, (b) to the knowledge of FNB, none of
the other parties to any such material contract, lease, license or other
agreement or instrument is, with or without the lapse of time or the giving
of notice, or both, in breach or default in any material respect thereunder

documents. PVFC shall prepare and furnish to FNB such information relating to
it and its directors, officers and shareholders as may be reasonably required
in connection with the above referenced documents based on its knowledge of
and access to the information required for said documents, and PVFC and its
legal, financial and accounting advisors, shall have the right to review in
advance and approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, such
Registration Statement prior to its filing. PVFC agrees to cooperate with FNB
and FNBs counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate
opinions, consents and letters from its financial advisor and independent
auditor in connection with the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement.
As long as PVFC has cooperated as described above, FNB agrees to file, or
cause to be filed, the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement with
the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of PVFC and FNB agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the filing thereof. FNB also agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions this
Agreement contemplates. After the SEC has declared the Registration Statement
effective under the Securities Act, PVFC shall promptly mail at its expense
the Proxy Statement to its shareholders.

 

(b) Each of PVFC and FNB agrees that none of the respective information
supplied or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference
in the Registration Statement shall, at the time the Registration Statement
and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the
Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated in this Agreement or necessary
to make the statements in this Agreement not misleading. Each of PVFC and FNB
agrees that none of the respective information supplied or to be supplied by
it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto shall contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated in this
Agreement or necessary to make the statements in this Agreement not
misleading. Each of PVFC and FNB further agree that if such party shall become
aware prior to the Effective Time of any

 



 

- 46 \-  information furnished by such party that would cause any of the statements
in the Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement to be false or misleading
with respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements in this Agreement not false or misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed promptly with the SEC
and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of PVFC.

(c) FNB agrees to advise PVFC, promptly after FNB receives notice thereof, of
the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any

threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC
for the amendment or supplement of the Registration Statement or
for additional information.

(d) The parties shall cooperate with each other and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to

Entities that are necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions this
Agreement contemplates, including the Merger, and to comply with the terms and
conditions of all such permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of
all such Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities. PVFC and FNB shall
have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will
consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the
exchange of information, all the information relating to PVFC or FNB, as the
case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party,
Regulatory Agency or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with respect to
the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties, Regulatory Agencies and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate the transactions this Agreement contemplates and each
party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating to
completion of the transactions this Agreement contemplates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require FNB to
take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of third parties, Regulatory Agencies or
Governmental Entities, that would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on FNB and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving
Company after giving effect to the Merger, taken as a whole after the
Effective Time (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition"). In addition,
PVFC agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable best efforts to assist FNB in
preparing and filing such petitions and filings, and in obtaining such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of third parties, Regulatory
Agencies and Governmental Entities, that may be necessary or advisable to
effect any mergers and/or consolidations of Subsidiaries of PVFC and FNB
following consummation of the Merger.

information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the Registration Statement

Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(f) Each of FNB and PVFC shall promptly provide each other with any written
communications received from any Regulatory Agency or Governmental Entity
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will
promptly advise the other upon receiving any oral communication with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from any Regulatory
Agency or Governmental Entity whose consent or approval is required for
consummation of the transactions this Agreement contemplates that causes such
party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite
Regulatory Approval (as defined in Section 7.1(c)) will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed.

(g) PVFC and FNB shall consult with each other before issuing any press
release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statements without the prior
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other
party, but after such consultation, to the extent practicable under the
circumstances, issue such press release or make such public statements as may
upon the advice of outside counsel be required by law or the rules or
regulations of the SEC, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the OCC, the NYSE
or NASDAQ. In addition, the Chief Executive Officers of PVFC and FNB shall be
permitted to respond to appropriate questions about the Merger from the
press. PVFC and FNB shall cooperate to develop all public announcement
materials and make appropriate management available at presentations related
to the Merger as reasonably requested by the other party.

exchange of information, each of PVFC and FNB shall, and shall cause each of
their respective Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,

access, during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective
Time, to all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records,
and, during such period, the parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, make available to the other party all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as the other may reasonably
request. PVFC shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, provide to
FNB a copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or received by it
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state banking
laws other than reports or documents that such party is not permitted to
disclose under applicable law. Neither PVFC nor FNB nor any of their
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-
client privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries or contravene any law,
rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement. The parties shall make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply to the extent possible in
light of those restrictions.

 



 

- 48 \- (b) All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements entered into
between PVFC and FNB (the "Confidentiality Agreements").

(c) No investigation by either of the parties or their respective
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.

 

6.3 _PVFC Shareholder Approval_. PVFC shall call a meeting of its shareholders
for the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder approval required in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger (the "PVFC Shareholders
Meeting"), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to convene such meeting
as soon as reasonably practicable following the Registration Statement being
declared effective, giving a reasonable amount of time for printing and
mailing. Subject to Section 6.11, the Board of Directors of PVFC shall
recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions this Agreement contemplates, by PVFCs shareholders and shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement (the "PVFC
Recommendation"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, PVFCs
obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.3 shall not be
affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to PVFC of any Acquisition Proposal, as defined in Section
6.11(e)(i). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.1, PVFCs obligations pursuant to the first sentence of
this Section 6.3 shall terminate.

6.4 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Cooperation_. Each of PVFC and FNB
agrees to exercise good faith and use its commercially reasonable best efforts
to satisfy the various covenants and conditions to Closing in this Agreement,
and to consummate the transactions this Agreement contemplates as promptly as
possible.

6.5  _NYSE Approval_. FNB shall cause the shares of FNB Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

 

6.6 _Benefit Plans_.

(a) [Intentionally deleted]

(b) As soon as administratively practicable after the Effective Time, FNB
shall take all reasonable action so that employees of PVFC and the PVFC
Subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in each FNB Benefit Plan of
general applicability with the exception of FNBs defined benefit
pension plan and any other plan frozen to new participants (collectively, the
"FNB Eligible Plans") to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of
FNB and its Subsidiaries, it being understood that inclusion of the employees
of PVFC and the PVFC Subsidiaries in the FNB Eligible Plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans, provided that coverage shall
be continued under corresponding PVFC Benefit Plans until such employees are
permitted to participate in the FNB Eligible Plans and provided further,
however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall require FNB or any of
its Subsidiaries to make any grants to any former employee of PVFC under any
discretionary equity compensation plan of FNB or to provide the same level of
(or any) employer contributions or other benefit subsidies as PVFC or the PVFC

 



 

- 49 \-  Subsidiaries. FNB shall cause each FNB Eligible Plan in which employees of
PVFC and the PVFC Subsidiaries are eligible to participate, to recognize, for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and vesting of,
benefits under the FNB Eligible Plans, the service of such employees with PVFC
and the PVFC Subsidiaries to the same extent as such service was credited for
such purpose by PVFC or the PVFC Subsidiaries, and, solely for purposes of
FNBs vacation programs, for purposes of determining the benefit amount,
provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized to the extent
that such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. Except for
the commitment to continue those PVFC Benefit Plans that correspond to FNB
Eligible Plans until employees of PVFC and the PVFC Subsidiaries are included
in such FNB Eligible Plans, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the ability
of FNB to amend or terminate any of the PVFC Benefit Plans in accordance with
and to the extent permitted by their terms at any time permitted by such
terms. PVFC acknowledges and agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any written or oral agreement to continue the
benefits under the company-paid life insurance policies listed on Section
3.11(i) of the PVFC Disclosure Schedule, and that FNB may, at its election,
discontinue such insurance policies. FNB agrees that it in the event it
should discontinue the insurance policies, it will provide the beneficiaries
the opportunity to take over his or her policy and assume the premiums.

At and following the Effective Time, and except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.6(f), FNB shall honor, and the Surviving Company shall continue to
be obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, all benefit
obligations to, and contractual rights of, current and former employees of
PVFC and the PVFC Subsidiaries and current and former directors of PVFC and
the PVFC Subsidiaries existing as of the Effective Date under any PVFC
Benefit Plan. Any years of service recognized for purposes of this Section
6.6 will be taken into account under the terms of any generally applicable
severance policy of FNB or its Subsidiaries.

 

(c) At such time as employees of PVFC and the PVFC Subsidiaries become
eligible to participate in a medical, dental or health plan of FNB or its
Subsidiaries, FNB shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and available
from its insurers, cause each such plan to (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations to the extent such conditions are covered under the
applicable medical, health or dental plans of FNB and (ii) waive any waiting
period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise
be applicable to such employee or dependent on or after the Effective Time to
the extent such employee or dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or
requirement under an analogous PVFC Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

(d) PVFC shall adopt such Board resolutions and take such other action as FNB
may reasonably request to cause the Park View Federal Savings Bank 401(k) Plan
(the "Plan") to be terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Plan Termination Date") and the accounts of all participants and
beneficiaries in the Plan as of the Plan Termination Date to become fully
vested as of the Plan Termination Date. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in no event later than one year after the Plan Termination
Date, FNB shall file or cause to be filed all necessary documents with the IRS
for a determination letter that the termination of the Plan as of the Plan
Termination Date will not adversely affect the Plans qualified status. FNB
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such favorable determination
letter; including, but not limited to, adopting such amendments to the Plan as
may be requested by the IRS as a condition to its issuance of a favorable
determination letter. As soon as practicable following the

 



 

- 50 \-  receipt of a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the
qualified status of the Plan upon its termination, the account balances in the
Plan shall be distributed to participants and beneficiaries or transferred to
an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account as
a participant or beneficiary may direct. The Surviving Company shall take all
other actions necessary to complete the termination of the Plan, including
filing a Final Form 5500, that arise after the Effective Time. FNB agrees, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, to permit Plan participants who become
employees of FNB and its Subsidiaries to roll over their account balances
in the Plan and loans from the Plan to the F.N.B. Corporation Progress
Savings 401(k) Plan. Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.6(b) to the
contrary, employees of PVFC or any PVFC Subsidiary who continue in employment
with the Surviving Company following the Effective Time shall be eligible as
of the Effective Time to participate in the F.N.B. Corporation Progress
Savings 401(k) Plan.

(e) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, PVFC shall, at the written
request of FNB, freeze or terminate each PVFC Benefit Plan as is requested by
FNB.

 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (each a "Claim") in
which any individual who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director
or officer of PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries or who is or was serving
at the request of PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
employee, member or otherwise of another Person (the "Indemnified Parties"),
is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is
or was a director or officer of PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries or was
serving at the request of the PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries as a
director or officer of another Person or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
transactions this Agreement contemplates, whether asserted or arising before
or after the Effective Time, the parties shall cooperate and use their best
efforts to defend against such Claim and respond thereto. From and after the
Effective Time, FNB shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent currently
provided under applicable Law, the PVFC Articles and the PVFC Code each such
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses, including reimbursement for reasonable fees and expenses, including
fees and expenses of legal counsel, incurred in advance of the final
disposition of any Claim upon receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable Law, and judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any such threatened or actual Claim.

(b) FNB and the Surviving Company agree that all rights to indemnification of
liabilities, including advancement of expenses, and all limitations with
respect thereto, existing in favor of any Indemnified Person, as provided in
the PVFC Articles or the PVFC Code, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect, without any amendment thereto; provided,
however, that in the event any Claim is asserted or made after the Effective
Date, any determination required to be made with respect to whether an
Indemnified Persons conduct complies with the standards set forth under the
OGCL, the PVFC Articles or the PVFC Code, as the case may be, shall be made
by independent legal counsel, whose fees and expenses shall be

 



 

- 51 \-  paid by FNB and the Surviving Company, selected by such Indemnified Person
and reasonably acceptable to FNB; and, provided further that nothing in this
Section 6.7 shall impair any rights or obligations of any current or former
director or officer of PVFC or its Subsidiaries, including pursuant to the
respective organizational documents of PVFC, or their respective Subsidiaries,
under the OGCL or otherwise.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, FNB shall obtain at the expense of PVFC, and
FNB shall maintain for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including the transactions this Agreement
contemplates, covering the Indemnified Persons who as of the Effective Time
are covered by PVFCs directors and officers liability insurance or
fiduciary liability insurance policies, provided that FNB may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms
and conditions that are not less advantageous than such policies of PVFC or
single premium tail coverage with policy limits equal to PVFCs existing
coverage limits, provided that in no event shall FNB be required to expend
for any one year an amount in excess of 150% of the annual premium currently
paid by PVFC for such insurance (the "Insurance Amount"), and further provided
that if FNB is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this
Section 6.7(c) as a result of the preceding provision, FNB shall use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the most advantageous coverage
as is available for the maximum Insurance Amount. The provisions of
the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time from an
insurer or insurers selected by FNB that have an insurer financial strength
rating by A.M. Best Co. of at least "A", which policies provide the
Indemnified Persons with coverage, from the Effective Time to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, including in respect of the transactions
this Agreement contemplates, on terms that are no less advantageous to
Indemnified Persons than PVFCs DandO Insurance existing immediately prior to
the date of this Agreement. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior
to the Effective Time, then FNB shall maintain such policies in full force
and effect and continue the obligations thereunder.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

6.8 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, including any merger between a Subsidiary of FNB, on the one hand,
and a Subsidiary of PVFC, on the other hand, or to vest the Surviving Company
with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and
franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper officers and directors
of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary
action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of, FNB.

6.9 _Advice of Changes_. Each of FNB and PVFC shall promptly advise the other
of any change or event (i) having or reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on it or (ii) that it believes would or would be reasonably
likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that
no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants
or

 



 

- 52 \-  agreements of the parties, or remedies with respect thereto, or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement; provided,
further, that a failure to comply with this Section 6.9 shall not constitute
the failure of any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless
the underlying Material Adverse Effect or material breach would independently
result in the failure of a condition set forth in Article VII to be
satisfied.

6.10 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, PVFC shall not declare or
pay any dividend in respect of PVFC Common Shares.

6.11 _Certain Actions_.

 

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, except as
otherwise permitted by this Section 6.11, PVFC will not, and will not
authorize or permit any of its directors, officers, agents, employees,

any discussions or negotiations with, furnish any information relating to PVFC

facilitate or encourage any effort by any third party that is seeking to make,
or has made, an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) except in accordance with
Section 8.1(g), approve, endorse or recommend or enter into any letter of

modify in a manner adverse to FNB the PVFC Recommendation except as set forth
in subsection (iii) below, (ii) to engage in any discussions or negotiations
with, and provide any information to, any third party in response to a
Superior Proposal, as defined in Section 6.11(e)(ii), by any such third
party, if and only to the extent that (x) PVFCs Board of Directors concludes
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to do so
would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of their fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, (y) prior to providing any information or data
to any third party in connection with a Superior Proposal by any such third
party, PVFCs Board of Directors receives from such third party an executed
confidentiality agreement, which confidentiality terms shall be no less
favorable to PVFC than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreements
between PVFC and FNB and (z) at least 48 hours prior to providing any
information or data to any third party or entering into discussions or
negotiations with any third party, PVFC promptly notifies FNB in writing of
the name of such third party and the material terms and conditions of any such
Superior Proposal and (iii) to withdraw, modify, qualify in a manner adverse
to FNB, condition or refuse to make the PVFC Recommendation (the "Change in
PVFC Recommendation") if PVFCs Board of Directors concludes in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, that failure
to do so could reasonably be expected to breach their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Notwithstanding any Change in PVFC Recommendation, this
Agreement shall be

 



 

- 53 \-  submitted to the shareholders of PVFC at the PVFC Shareholders Meeting for
the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and nothing contained
herein shall be deemed to relieve PVFC of such obligation; provided, however,
that if the Board of Directors of PVFC shall have effected a Change in PVFC
Recommendation, then the Board of Directors of PVFC may submit this Agreement
to PVFCs shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions
adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded), in which
event the Board of Directors of PVFC may communicate the basis for its lack of
a recommendation to PVFCs shareholders in the Proxy Statement or an

applicable Law. In addition to the foregoing, PVFC shall not submit to the
vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger prior
to the termination of this Agreement.

Person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement relating to

Proposal or to PVFC or its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore
furnished by PVFC or any of its Representatives to such Person or any of such
Persons Representatives in accordance with the terms of any confidentiality

Subsidiaries, without taking action that would, in effect, give FNB control
over the management or policies of PVFC or any of the PVFC Subsidiaries.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date of this
Agreement through the Closing Date and consistent with the performance of
their day-to-day operations, the continuous operation of PVFC and the PVFC
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and applicable Law, PVFC shall

the Bank, to cooperate with FNB in performing tasks reasonably required in
connection with such integration.

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Date, and the Merger may be abandoned:

(a) _Mutual Consent_. By the mutual consent in writing of FNB and PVFC if the
Board of Directors of each so determines by vote of a majority of the members
of its entire Board.

(b) _Breach_.

(i) By FNB, if (A) any of the representations and warranties of PVFC
contained in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct such that the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) would not be satisfied or (B) PVFC shall
have breached or failed to comply with any of its obligations under this
Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2(b) would
not be satisfied, in either case other than as a result of a material breach
by FNB of any of its obligations under this Agreement and such failure or
breach with respect to any such representation, warranty or obligation cannot
be cured, or, if curable, shall continue unremedied for a period of 30 days
after PVFC has received written notice from FNB of the occurrence of such
failure or breach, but in no event shall such 30-day period extend beyond
December 31, 2013.

(ii) By PVFC, if (A) any of the representations and warranties of FNB
contained in this Agreement shall fail to be true and correct such that the
condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) would not be satisfied or (B) FNB shall

is not consummated on or before 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on December 31, 2013,
unless the failure of the Merger to be consummated by such date shall have

Section 8.1(c) to perform or observe the covenants and agreements of such
party set forth in this Agreement. 

(d) _No Regulatory Approval_. By FNB or PVFC, if its Board of Directors so
determines, in the event the approval of any Governmental Entity required for
consummation of the Merger this Agreement contemplates shall have been denied

therefor shall have been permanently withdrawn at the request of a
Governmental Entity; provided, however, that no party shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d) if such denial shall
be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform or observe the covenants of such party set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

- 59 \- (e) _No PVFC Shareholder Approval_. By FNB, or by PVFC provided that PVFC
shall not be in material breach of any of its obligations under Section 6.3,

breached its obligations under Section 6.3 by failing to call, give notice
of, convene and hold the PVFC Shareholders Meeting.

(g) _Superior Proposal_. At any time prior to the date of mailing of
the Proxy Statement, by PVFC in order to enter concurrently into an
Acquisition Proposal that has been received by PVFC and the PVFC Board of
Directors in compliance with Sections 6.11(a) and (b) and that PVFCs Board of
Directors concludes in good faith, in consultation with its financial and
legal advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal;
provided, however, that this Agreement may be terminated by PVFC pursuant to
this Section 8.1(g) only after the fifth business day following PVFCs
provision of written notice to FNB advising FNB that the PVFC Board of
Directors is prepared to accept a Superior Proposal, it being agreed that the
delivery of such notice shall not entitle FNB to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(g) and only if (i) during such five-business day
period, PVFC has caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate with FNB
in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal and (ii) PVFCs Board of Directors has considered such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement resulting from
such negotiations and has concluded in good faith, based upon consultation
with its financial and legal advisers, that such Acquisition Proposal remains

presented in connection with Merger by the shareholders of PVFC; provided,
however, that after any approval of the transactions this Agreement
contemplates by the shareholders of PVFC, there may not be, without further
approval of the PVFC shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that
requires such further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the

any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (ii) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement

with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is

as practicable, implements the original purposes and intents of this
Agreement.

9.10 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any

VOTING AGREEMENT

 

   , 2013 

F.N.B. Corporation

One F.N.B. Boulevard

Hermitage, PA 16148

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

Concurrently with the execution of this letter agreement ("Voting Agreement"),
F.N.B. Corporation, a Florida corporation (" _FNB_ "), and PVF Capital Corp.,
an Ohio corporation (" _PVFC_ "), are entering into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, of even date herewith (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), whereby PVFC will
merge with and into FNB (the " _Merger_ ") and shareholders of PVFC will
receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in the Merger Agreement, subject
to the closing of the Merger. All defined terms used but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Merger Agreement.

A condition to FNBs obligations under the Merger Agreement is that I
execute and deliver this Voting Agreement to FNB.

Intending to be legally bound hereby, I irrevocably agree and represent as
follows: 

(a) As of the date of this Voting Agreement, I have, and at all times during
the term of this Voting Agreement will have, beneficial ownership (as defined
in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) of, and good and valid title to, the
number of common shares, par value $0.01 per share, of PVFC (the " _PVFC
Common Shares_ "), that is set forth on _Appendix A_ hereto, and I hold stock
options to acquire the number of PVFC Common Shares set forth on _Appendix A_
hereto. All of the securities listed on _Appendix A_ are owned free and clear
of any proxy or voting restriction, claims, liens, encumbrances and security
interests and any other limitation or restriction whatsoever (including any
restriction on the right to dispose of such securities). None of the
securities listed on _Appendix A_ are subject to any voting trust or other
agreement or arrangement with respect to the voting rights of such securities.

(b) As of the date of this Voting Agreement, except for the securities set
forth on _Appendix A_ , I do not beneficially own any (i) shares of capital
stock or voting securities of PVFC, (ii) securities of PVFC convertible into
or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of PVFC or
(iii) options or other rights to acquire from PVFC any capital stock, voting
securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or
voting securities of PVFC. The PVFC Common Shares listed on _Appendix A_ ,
together with all PVFC Common Shares that I subsequently acquire during the
term of this Voting Agreement, including through the exercise of any stock
options, warrants or similar instruments, are referred to herein as the "
_Shares_ ".

 



B-1  (c) At the PVFC Shareholders Meeting and at any other meeting of PVFC
shareholders, however called, and on every action or approval by written
consent of shareholders of PVFC, I will vote or cause to be voted all Shares
over which I have sole voting power, and I will use my best efforts to cause
any Shares over which I share voting power to be voted in favor of (i)
approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby, and (ii) any proposal to adjourn or postpone such
meeting to a later date if there are not sufficient votes to approve
the Merger Agreement. Determinations as to "sole" or "shared" voting power
shall be made in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act.

(d) During the term of this Voting Agreement, I will not, directly or
indirectly, offer, sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or otherwise dispose of
(collectively, " _Transfer_ ") any Shares over which I have sole dispositive
power (or any interest therein), and I will use my best efforts to not permit
the Transfer of any Shares over which I have shared dispositive power (or any
interest therein), except to the extent permitted by paragraph (g) hereof.

(e) I agree that PVFC shall not be bound by any attempted sale of any PVFC
Common Shares over which I have sole voting and dispositive power, and PVFCs
transfer agent shall be given appropriate stop transfer orders and shall not
be required to register any such attempted sale, unless the sale has been
effected in compliance with the terms of this Voting Agreement.

(f) I represent that I have the legal capacity to enter into this Voting
Agreement, that I have duly and validly executed and delivered this Voting
Agreement and that this Voting Agreement is a valid and binding obligation
enforceable against me in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency and other laws affecting creditors rights and general equitable
principles; and further, that no consent of my spouse is necessary under any
"community property" or other laws in order for me to enter into and perform
my obligations under this Voting Agreement.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, I may Transfer any or all
of the Shares over which I have beneficial ownership to my spouse, ancestors
or descendants; _provided_ , _however_ , that in any such case, prior to and
as a condition to the effectiveness of such Transfer, each person to which any
of such Shares or any interest in any of such Shares is or may be Transferred
shall have executed and delivered to FNB an agreement to be bound by the terms
of this Voting Agreement.

I am signing this Voting Agreement solely in my capacity as a shareholder of
PVFC and as an optionholder and/or warrantholder, if I am such, and not in any
other capacity, such as a director or officer of PVFC or as a fiduciary of
any trusts in which I am not a beneficiary. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary: (a) I make no agreement or understanding herein in any capacity
other than in my capacity as a beneficial owner of PVFC Common Shares and (b)
nothing herein shall be construed to limit or affect any action or inaction by
me or any of my representatives, as applicable, in serving on PVFCs Board of
Directors or as an officer of PVFC, in acting in my capacity as a director,
officer or fiduciary of PVFC.

This Voting Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and
effect concurrently with, and automatically upon, the earlier to occur of (a)
the favorable vote of the PVFC shareholders with respect to the approval of
the Merger Agreement, (b) the Effective Time, (c) FNB and I enter into a
written agreement to terminate this Voting Agreement, or (d) any termination
of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms, except that any such
termination shall be without prejudice to FNBs rights if termination should
arise out of my willful breach of any covenant or representation contained
herein.

 



B-2  All notices and other communications in connection with this Voting Agreement

via facsimile, with confirmation, mailed by registered or certified mail,
return receipt requested, or delivered by an express courier, with

This Voting Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties. This Voting Agreement constitutes the
entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Voting Agreement.

I agree and acknowledge that FNB may be irreparably harmed by, and that there
may be no adequate remedy at law for, any violation of this Voting Agreement
by me. Without limiting other remedies, FNB shall have the right to seek to
enforce this Voting Agreement by specific performance or injunctive relief.
This Voting Agreement and all claims arising hereunder or relating hereto,
shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of law thereof. I hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submit to
the exclusive jurisdiction of any Pennsylvania state court or the United
States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, in any action
or proceeding arising out of or relating to this letter.

 

If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Voting Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Voting Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long
as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Voting
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 

This Voting Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile
transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties
hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed
to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.
