            Section 3.2 Fractional Shares; Adjustments.

            (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of Cardiac Common Shares exchanged pursuant to the Cardiac Merger who
would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Holding Company
Common Share (after taking into account all Cardiac Common Shares delivered by
such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to such fractional part of a Holding Company Common Share
multiplied by the product of the closing price of a Cardiac Common Share on
Nasdaq as of the last trading day immediately preceding the effective time of
the Cardiac Merger and the Cardiac Exchange Ratio. No such holder shall be

amount equal to such fractional part of a Holding Company Common Share
multiplied by the product of the closing price of a Quinton Common Share on
Nasdaq as of the last trading day immediately preceding the effective time of
the Quinton Merger and the Quinton Exchange Ratio. No such holder shall be
entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights as a stockholder in
respect of any fractional shares of Holding Company Common Stock. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of fractional Holding Company Common
Shares.

            (c) If at any time during the period between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of Cardiac
or Quinton, as the case may be, or securities convertible or exchangeable into
capital stock of Cardiac or Quinton, as the case may be, shall occur by reason
of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange
or readjustment of shares, or any stock or cash dividend or distribution thereon
or a record date with respect to any of the foregoing shall occur during such
period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to
the holders of the Cardiac Common Shares and the Quinton Common Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to the consummation of
such event.

            Section 3.3 Exchange of Certificates.

            (a) Exchange Agent. Promptly after the date hereof, Cardiac and
Quinton shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company as an exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") for the benefit of holders of Cardiac Common Shares and
Quinton Common Shares. At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, Holding
Company shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with
this Section, through the Exchange Agent, (i) certificates evidencing the total
number of Holding Company Common Shares to be issued in the Mergers, and (ii)
cash in the amount necessary to pay amounts due pursuant to Section 3.2 (such
certificates for Holding Company Common Shares and such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions in accordance with this Article III, deliver the
Holding Company Common Shares and cash contemplated to be issued pursuant to
this Article


                                       11
<PAGE>

III out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by Section 3.3(e), Section
3.3(f) or Section 3.3(g) hereof, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any
other purpose.

            (b) Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Holding Company shall send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each holder of record of Cardiac Common Shares and Quinton Common
Shares that were converted into the right to receive Holding Company Common
Shares and cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to this Article III, a
letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in customary form and
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Cardiac Common Shares or Quinton Common Shares to the
Exchange Agent), for use in the exchange contemplated by this Section. Upon
surrender of a certificate representing Cardiac Common Shares or Quinton Common
Shares to the Exchange Agent (an "Exchanged Certificate"), together with a duly
executed letter of transmittal, the holder of such Exchanged Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing that
number of whole Holding Company Common Shares and cash which such holder has the
right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article III (after giving
effect to any required withholding tax). Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section, each Exchanged Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration and unpaid dividends and distributions thereon, if any, as
provided in this Article III. If any portion of the applicable Merger
Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Exchanged Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that the Exchanged Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as
a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Exchanged Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable. If any Exchanged Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Exchanged Certificate to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and, if required by Holding Company, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as Holding Company may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Exchanged
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Exchanged Certificate, the proper amount of the applicable Merger
Consideration, together with any unpaid dividends and distributions on any such
Holding Company Common Shares, as contemplated by this Article III.

            (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Whenever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Holding Company in respect of the
Holding Company Common Shares, the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions
in respect of all Holding Company Common Shares issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Holding Company Common Shares constituting part
of the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to
any such holder, until such Certificates are surrendered as provided in this
Section. Following such surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the
Person in whose name the Holding Company Common Shares have been registered (i)
at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date at or after the Effective Time previously paid or payable on
the date of such surrender with respect to such whole Holding Company Common
Shares, less the amount of any withholding taxes that may be required thereon,
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date subsequent to surrender, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date at or after the Effective
Time but prior to surrender and a payment


                                       12
<PAGE>

date subsequent to surrender payable with respect to such whole Holding Company
Common Shares, less the amount of any withholding taxes which may be required
thereon.

            (d) No Further Ownership Rights. As of the Effective Time, all
Cardiac Common Shares and Quinton Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a Certificate representing any such Cardiac Common
Shares or Quinton Common Shares, as the case may be, shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive, upon surrender of such
Certificate, the applicable Merger Consideration. As of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of both parties shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on each parties stock transfer books of
Cardiac Common Shares or Quinton Common Shares, as the case may be, outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to Holding Company for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as contemplated by this Article III.

            (e) Return of Merger Consideration. Upon demand by Holding Company,
the Exchange Agent shall deliver to Holding Company any portion of the Merger
Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section that
remains undistributed to holders of Cardiac Common Shares and Quinton Common
Shares one year after the Effective Time. Holders of Certificates who have not
complied with this Section prior to such demand shall thereafter look only to
Holding Company for payment of any claim to the Merger Consideration and
dividends or distributions, if any, in respect thereof.

            (f) No Liability. Neither Holding Company nor the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Cardiac Common Shares (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or Quinton Common Shares (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) for any amounts paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

            (g) Withholding Rights. Holding Company shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Merger Consideration (and any dividends or distributions
thereon) otherwise payable hereunder to any Person such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
any provision of federal, state, local or foreign income Tax Law. To the extent
that Holding Company so withholds those amounts, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Cardiac Common Shares or Quinton Common Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Holding Company.

            Section 3.4 Stock Options; ESPP; Warrants.

            (a) Option Adjustment.

                  (i) As of the Effective Time of the Quinton Merger, each
outstanding Quinton Option shall thereafter entitle the holder thereof to
receive, upon the exercise thereof, that number of Holding Company Common Shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number
of Quinton Common Shares subject to such Quinton Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Quinton Merger and (ii) the Quinton Exchange Ratio, at an
exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the
exercise price


                                       13
<PAGE>

per Quinton Common Share subject to such Quinton Option divided by (z) the
Quinton Exchange Ratio.

                  (ii) As of the Effective Time of the Cardiac Merger, each
outstanding Cardiac Option shall thereafter entitle the holder thereof to
receive, upon the exercise thereof, that number of Holding Company Common Shares
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (i) the number
of Cardiac Common Shares subject to such Cardiac Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time of the Cardiac Merger and (ii) the Cardiac Exchange Ratio, at an
exercise price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (y) the
exercise price per Cardiac Common Share subject to such Cardiac Option divided
by (z) the Cardiac Exchange Ratio.

            (b) Assumption of Stock Plans. As of the Effective Time, Holding
Company shall assume in full, on the same terms and conditions the Quinton Stock
Plans and the Cardiac Stock Plan, including each Quinton Option and each Cardiac
Option (collectively, the "Options"), whether vested or unvested, subject to the
adjustment provided in Section 3.4(a). Except for the acceleration of unvested
Cardiac Options pursuant to the Cardiac Plan, the assumption of the Options by
Holding Company shall not terminate or modify (except as required under this
Agreement) any right of first refusal, right of repurchase, vesting schedule or
other restriction on transferability relating to such Option or the stock
issuable upon the exercise thereof. Continuous employment with Quinton (or any
Subsidiary thereof) or Cardiac (or any Subsidiary thereof), as the case may be,
shall be credited to an optionee for purposes of determining the number of
shares subject to exercise, vesting or repurchase after the Effective Time, and
the provisions in the Quinton Stock Plans or Cardiac Stock Plan, as the case may
be, and/or in any stock option agreement evidencing the terms and conditions of
any Option issued thereunder relating to the exercisability of any such Option
upon termination of an optionee's employment or service shall not be deemed
triggered until such time as such optionee shall be neither an employee or
service provider of Holding Company or any Subsidiary of Holding Company. After
such assumption, Holding Company shall issue, upon any partial or total exercise
of any Option assumed hereunder, in lieu of Quinton Common Shares or Cardiac
Common Shares, as the case may be, the number of Holding Company Common Shares
to which the holder of such option is entitled pursuant to this Agreement. The
assumption by Holding Company of Options hereunder shall not give holders of
such Options any additional benefits which they did not have immediately prior
to the Effective Time and shall not create any implied agreement for employment.
Holding Company shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable, and in any event
within five Business Days following the Effective Time, a registration statement
on Form S-8 (or such other appropriate form) under the Securities Act, covering
the Holding Company Common Shares to be issued upon the exercise of Options
assumed by Holding Company. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Quinton and
Cardiac shall make such amendments, if any, to the Quinton Stock Plans and
Cardiac Stock Plan, respectively, and any award or agreement evidencing an
Option issued thereunder as shall be necessary to permit such assumption in
accordance with this Section 3.4. It is the intention of the parties that (i)
the Options assumed by Holding Company shall qualify following the Effective
Time as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the
same extent as such Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately
prior to the Effective Time, (ii) the assumption of Options provided by this
Section 3.4 shall satisfy the conditions of Section 424(a) of the Code and (iii)
the provisions of this Section 3.4 shall be applied consistent with this intent.

            (c) ESPP. As of the Effective Time, Holding Company shall assume the
Quinton ESPP, the outstanding offering periods under the Quinton ESPP, and all
outstanding purchase rights


                                       14
<PAGE>

thereunder shall be converted (in accordance with the Quinton Exchange Ratio)
into rights to purchase Holding Company Common Shares (with the number of shares
rounded down to the nearest whole share and the purchase price as of the
offering date for each offering period in effect as of the Effective Time
rounded up to the nearest whole cent). All such converted purchase rights shall
be assumed by Holding Company, and each offering period in effect under the
Quinton ESPP immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be continued until
the end of such offering period in accordance with the terms of the Quinton
ESPP. From and after the Effective Time, all references to Quinton in the
Quinton ESPP and related documents shall be deemed to refer to Holding Company
(provided, that the purchase price as of the offering date for a relevant period
shall be determined with respect to the fair market value of Quinton Common
Shares on such date, as adjusted by this Section 3.4). Holding Company shall
take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number
of Holding Company Common Shares for issuance upon exercise of the purchase
rights under the Quinton ESPP assumed in accordance with this Section 3.4.
Holding Company shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable, and in any event
within five Business Days following the Effective Time, a registration statement
on Form S-8 under the Securities Act, covering the Holding Company Common Shares
to be issued upon the exercise of converted purchase rights hereunder. Prior to
the Effective Time, Quinton shall make such amendments, if any, to the Quinton
ESPP as shall be necessary to permit assumption of the Quinton ESPP in
accordance with this Section 3.4.

            (d) Warrants. As of the Effective Time, warrants to purchase Quinton
Common Shares or Cardiac Common Shares which are outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be assumed by the Holding Company at the Effective

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF QUINTON

      Except as disclosed in the Quinton Disclosure Letter or the Quinton SEC
Documents filed since December 31, 2003 and prior to the date hereof (but
excluding any risk factor disclosure contained in such Quinton SEC Document

duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware, and has all corporate powers required to carry on its
business as now conducted. Quinton is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
the property owned or leased by it or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Quinton Material Adverse Effect.
Quinton has heretofore made available to Cardiac true and complete copies of
Quinton's certificate of incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect.

            Section 4.2 Corporate Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Quinton of this Agreement and the consummation by Quinton of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within Quinton's corporate powers and,
except for the Quinton Stockholder Approval, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the only vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Quinton
required by Law to approve this Agreement, the Quinton Merger and/or any of the
other transactions contemplated hereby is the affirmative vote (the "Quinton
Stockholder Approval") of the holders of a


                                       15

including the Quinton Merger, are in the best interests of Quinton and its
stockholders, (b) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including for purposes of rendering Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable
to this Agreement and the Quinton Merger and (c) resolved (subject to Section
7.4) to recommend to such stockholders that they vote in favor of adopting and
approving this Agreement and the Quinton Merger in accordance with the terms
hereof. Assuming that this Agreement constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Cardiac, this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement
of Quinton, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws, now or hereafter in
effect, relating to or affecting creditors' rights and remedies and to general
principles of equity.

            Section 4.3 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by Quinton of this Agreement and the consummation by Quinton of the
transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any Governmental Entity other than (a) the filing of the

applicable requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of
1976 (the "HSR Act") or decrees thereunder applicable to Quinton; (c) compliance
with any applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; (d)
such as may be required under any applicable state securities Laws; and (e) such
other consents, approvals, actions, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings which, if not obtained or made, would not, individually
or in the aggregate, (x) be reasonably likely to have a Quinton Material Adverse
Effect or (y) prevent or materially impair the ability of Quinton to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            Section 4.4 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and
performance by Quinton of this Agreement and the consummation by Quinton of the
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (a) contravene or conflict
with Quinton's certificate of incorporation or bylaws, (b) assuming compliance
with the matters referred to in Section 4.3, contravene or conflict with or
constitute a violation of any provision of any Law, judgment, injunction, order
or decree binding upon or applicable to Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries, (c)
constitute a breach or default under or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any right or obligation of Quinton or any of its
Subsidiaries or to a loss of any benefit or status to which Quinton or any of
its Subsidiaries is entitled under any provision of any material agreement,
contract or other instrument binding upon Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries or
any material license, franchise, permit or other similar authorization held by
Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries, or (d) result in the creation or imposition
of any Lien on any asset of Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries other than, in
the case of each of (b) and (d), any such items that would not, individually or
in the aggregate (x) be reasonably likely to have a Quinton Material Adverse
Effect or (y) prevent or materially impair the ability of Quinton to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            Section 4.6 Subsidiaries.

            (a) Each Subsidiary of Quinton is a corporation duly incorporated or
an entity duly organized, and is validly existing and in good standing, under

            (b) Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other
ownership interest in, each Subsidiary of Quinton has been validly issued and is
fully paid and nonassessable. All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other

or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any

            Section 4.7 The Quinton SEC Documents.

            (a) Quinton has made available to Cardiac the Quinton SEC Documents.
Quinton has filed all reports, filings, registration statements and other
documents required to be filed by it with the SEC since December 31, 2002. No

statement or prospectus or other document with the SEC.

            (b) As of its filing date, each Quinton SEC Document complied with
the applicable requirements of the Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be. No Quinton SEC Document filed or furnished pursuant to the
Exchange Act contained, as of its filing date or mailing date, as applicable,
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Quinton SEC
Document filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, contained, as of the date such document or amendment became
effective, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading.

            (c) Quinton has heretofore furnished to Cardiac a complete and
correct copy of any amendments or modifications, which have not yet been filed
with the SEC but which are required to be filed, to agreements, documents or
other instruments which previously had been filed by Quinton with the SEC
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.

            (d) Each required form, report and document containing financial
statements that has been filed with or submitted to the SEC since July 31, 2002,
was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or submitted by
Quinton's chief executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and at the time of filing or submission of each such
certification, such certification was true and accurate and complied with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

            Section 4.8 Financial Statements.

            (a) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in
each case, any related notes thereto) contained in the Quinton SEC Documents
(the "Quinton Financial Statements") and the unaudited financial statements for
the quarter ended September 30, 2004 (without notes thereto) (i) was prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of
unaudited interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form
10-Q under the Exchange Act) and (ii) fairly presented the consolidated
financial position of Quinton and its Subsidiaries as at the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated, consistent with the books and records of Quinton, except that
the unaudited financial statements were or are subject to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments which were not, or are not expected to be, material in
amount. Neither Quinton, any of its Subsidiaries nor, to Quinton's Knowledge,
any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of
Quinton or


                                       18
<PAGE>

any of its Subsidiaries, has received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of
any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral,
regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or
methods of Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries or its internal accounting
controls, including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that Quinton
or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices. No attorney representing Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries, whether
or not employed by Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of
a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by Quinton or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to
its Board of Directors or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of
Quinton.

            (b) Quinton has made available to Cardiac an unaudited draft balance
sheet as of December 31, 2004 and the related unaudited draft statements of
operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity for the year ended
December 31, 2004 (the "2004 Quinton Financial Statements"). To the Knowledge of
Quinton as of the date hereof, the 2004 Quinton Financial Statements (i) were
prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for the omission of notes thereto) and
(ii) fairly present the consolidated financial position of Quinton and its
Subsidiaries and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2004, consistent with the books and records
of Quinton.

            Section 4.9 No Material Undisclosed Liabilities. As of the date
hereof, there are no liabilities of Quinton or of any Subsidiary of Quinton of
any kind whatsoever, whether accrued, contingent, absolute, determined,
determinable or otherwise, in each case, that are required by GAAP to be set
forth on a consolidated balance sheet of Quinton, other than:

                  (i) liabilities or obligations disclosed or provided for in
the Quinton Financial Statements or disclosed in the notes thereto; and

                  (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred or arising in the
ordinary course of business after the date of the Quinton Financial Statements
included in the Quinton 10-Q relating to the quarter ended September 30, 2004 or
arising under this Agreement or incurred in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby; and

                  (iii) other liabilities or obligations, which individually do
not exceed $25,000 and in the aggregate do not exceed $100,000.

            Section 4.10 Information to Be Supplied.

            (a) The information to be supplied in writing by Quinton expressly
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will (i) in the case of the Registration Statement, at the
time it becomes effective, not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) in the case of the
remainder of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, at the time of the mailing
thereof and at the time of the Quinton Stockholders Meeting, not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required

respect to any statements made or incorporated by reference in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied in writing by Cardiac
expressly for use therein.

assets) or any relinquishment by Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries of any
contract or other right, in either case, material to Quinton and its

litigation and Tax proceedings) in the ordinary course of business consistent

with any Taxing authority by, or with respect to, Quinton and its Subsidiaries
were filed on a timely basis and were true, complete and correct except to the
extent that the failure to file or be true, complete and correct would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Quinton Material Adverse Effect; (b)
Quinton and its Subsidiaries have timely paid all material Taxes shown as due

Financial Statements) except to the extent that the failure to pay would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Quinton Material Adverse Effect; (c)

            (a) Quinton has made available to Cardiac each material "employee
benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), each material employment, severance or similar
contract, plan, arrangement or policy and each other material plan or
arrangement providing for compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing, stock option or
other stock related rights or other forms of incentive or deferred compensation
or insurance coverage (including any self-insured arrangements and, if
applicable, related trust agreements), all amendments thereto and the most
recent written summary descriptions thereof, together with the most recent
annual report (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B thereto) prepared

contributed to by Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries and covers any employee or
former employee of Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) with respect to
which Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries has or could have any material
liability or expense. Such plans are referred to collectively herein as the
"Quinton Employee Plans."

            (b) Each Quinton Employee Plan which is intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and (i) has received an
unrevoked favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect to such
Quinton Employee Plan's qualified status under the Code, as amended by the Tax

applicable Treasury regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to request, and
make any amendments necessary to obtain, such a letter from the IRS, or (iii) is
entitled, under IRS Announcement 2001-77, to rely on the favorable opinion or
advisory letter issued by the IRS to the prototype or volume submitter plan


                                       21

sponsor of such Quinton Employee Plan. Nothing has occurred, or is reasonably
expected by Quinton that could adversely affect the qualification or exemption
of any such Quinton Employee Plan. Quinton will make available upon request to
Cardiac copies of the most recent IRS determination letters with respect to each
such Quinton Employee Plan. Each Quinton Employee Plan has been administered in
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
Laws, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to
such Quinton Employee Plan except as would not be reasonably likely to have a
Quinton Material Adverse Effect. Quinton, each of its Subsidiaries and all other
Persons (including, without limitation, all fiduciaries) have, at all times and
in all material respects, properly performed all of their duties and obligations
(whether arising by operation of law or by contract) under or with respect to
such Quinton Employee Plan, including, without limitation, all reporting,
disclosure and notification obligations. All contributions, premiums and other
payments due or required to be paid to (or with respect to) each Quinton
Employee Plan have been timely paid, or, if not yet due, have been properly
accrued on the Quinton Financial Statements.

            (c) Neither Quinton nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, maintains
or contributes to, and has never sponsored, maintained or contributed to (or
been obligated to sponsor, maintain or contribute to), (i) a "multiemployer
plan," as defined in Section 3(37) or Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (ii) a
multiple employer plan within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or

ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, or (iv) a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement," as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA.

            (d) There are no actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims
for benefits) pending or, to the Knowledge of the Quinton, threatened with
respect to (or against the assets of) any Quinton Employee Plan except as would
not be reasonably likely to have a Quinton Material Adverse Effect, nor, to the
Knowledge of the Quinton, is there a basis for any such action, suit or claim.
No Quinton Employee Plan is currently under investigation, audit or review,
directly or indirectly, by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or any other
governmental entity or agency except as would not be reasonably likely to have a
Quinton Material Adverse Effect, and, to the Knowledge of the Quinton, no such
action is contemplated or under consideration by the IRS, the U.S. Department of
Labor or any other Governmental Entity.

            (e) The execution of, and performance of the transactions
contemplated in, this Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of
any additional or subsequent events) constitute an event under any Quinton
Employee Plan, employment or severance agreement to which Quinton or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, trust or loan that will or may result in any material
payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to fund
benefits with respect to any current or former employee, executive or director
of Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries.

            (f) To the Knowledge of Quinton, neither Quinton nor any of its
Subsidiaries maintains or contributes to any Quinton Employee Plan which
provides, or has any liability to provide, life insurance, medical or other
welfare benefits to any employee upon such employee's retirement or termination
of employment, except as required by Section 601 of ERISA and Section 4980B of
the Code.

            (g) To the Knowledge of Quinton, there has been no amendment to,
written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) to create, enter
into, contribute to or


                                       22
<PAGE>

otherwise relating to any Quinton Employee Plan which would increase materially
the expense of maintaining such Quinton Employee Plans in the aggregate above
the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2004.

            (h) To the Knowledge of Quinton, Quinton and each of its
Subsidiaries is in substantial compliance with all applicable Laws respecting
employment, employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages,
hours and withholding. No work stoppage or labor strike against Quinton or any
Affiliate of Quinton is pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated. Quinton
does not know of any activities or proceedings of any labor union to organize
any Quinton employees. There are no Actions pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Quinton, threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to any labor, safety or
discrimination matters involving any Quinton employee, including, without
limitation, charges of unfair labor practices or discrimination complaints,
which, if adversely determined, would, individually or in the aggregate, result

Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the
National Labor Relations Act. Neither Quinton nor any of its Subsidiaries is
presently, or has it been in the past, a party to, or bound by, any collective
bargaining agreement or union contract with respect to Quinton employees and no
collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated with respect to Quinton
employees. Neither Quinton nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material

            (a) Quinton and its Subsidiaries have all material licenses, permits
and qualifications necessary to conduct their businesses and own their
properties in each jurisdiction in which Quinton or its Subsidiaries currently
do business or own property, or in which such license, permit or qualification
is otherwise required. Quinton and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all Laws applicable to their businesses and the present

Exchange Act and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of Nasdaq. There are no outstanding loans made by Quinton to any of
its executive officers (as defined under Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or

any loans to any such executive officer or director. Quinton has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that information relating to Quinton, required to be
disclosed by Quinton in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to Quinton's principal executive officer and

has established and maintains internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act); such internal
controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Quinton's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent
evaluation, to Quinton's auditors and the audit committee of the board of
directors of Quinton (x) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect Quinton's ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for its auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Quinton's internal controls. Since January 1, 2003, neither Quinton, nor
to the Knowledge of Quinton, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or representative of Quinton has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim,
whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices,
procedures, methodologies or methods of Quinton or its internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that

Act.

            (c) To the Knowledge of Quinton, no employee of Quinton has provided
or is providing information to any law enforcement agency regarding the
commission or possible commission of any crime or the violation or possible
violation of any applicable Law. Neither Quinton nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor or agent of Quinton or any such
Subsidiaries has discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any
other manner discriminated against an employee of Quinton or any of its
Subsidiaries in the terms and conditions of employment because of any act of
such employee described in 18 U.S.C. Section 1514A(a).

businesses or predecessor entities) which would have a Quinton Material Adverse
Effect, and there are no facts, conditions, situations or set of circumstances
that have resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in or be the basis

divisions, renewals, extensions, provisionals, continuations and
continuations-in-part thereof; registered trademarks and applications therefor;
and registered copyrights and applications therefor owned or controlled by
Quinton or its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Quinton Registered Intellectual
Property"), together with any other type of rights in Intellectual Property that

development, manufacturing or commercialization of any Quinton product, are
collectively referred to herein as "Quinton Intellectual Property Rights".
Section 4.19 of the Quinton Disclosure Letter lists all Quinton Registered
Intellectual Property. All Quinton Intellectual Property Rights are either (i)
owned by, or subject to a valid license or a valid obligation of assignment to,
Quinton or its Subsidiaries free and clear of all mortgages, liens, security
interests, leases, pledges, encumbrances, equities, claims, charges, options,
written restrictions, rights of first refusal, title retention agreements or
other exceptions to title which affect the Quinton Intellectual Property Rights
or restrict the use by Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries of the Quinton
Intellectual Property Rights in any material way ("Quinton IP Liens"), or (ii)

Quinton) of all Quinton IP Liens. Quinton and its Subsidiaries are the sole
legal and beneficial owners of all the Quinton Intellectual Property Rights.
There are no actions pending or, to the Knowledge of Quinton, threatened with
regard to the ownership or control by Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries of any
of the Quinton Intellectual Property Rights. To the Knowledge of Quinton and its
Subsidiaries, the Quinton Intellectual Property Rights have not been, and are
not being, infringed. To the Knowledge of Quinton and its Subsidiaries , the
Quinton Intellectual Property rights are valid and enforceable. To the Knowledge

communications challenging the validity or enforceability of the Quinton
Intellectual Property Rights or their ownership of Quinton Intellectual Property
Rights. There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Quinton or its
Subsidiaries, threatened claims that Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries has
infringed or is infringing (including with respect to the manufacture, use, sale
or importation by Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries of any commercial products
or to the operations of Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries) any Intellectual
Property of any Person. To the Knowledge of Quinton and its Subsidiaries , there
are no patent rights of any third Party that are known to be dominating,
interfering, or potentially dominating or interfering and that could be asserted
by a Person to exclude or prevent Quinton or its Subsidiaries or licensees from
manufacturing or commercializing their products. Neither Quinton nor its
Subsidiaries knows of any valid grounds for any bona fide claim that the conduct
of Quinton's or its Subsidiaries business will infringe or misappropriate any of
the Intellectual Property rights owned by any other Person.

            (b) Quinton and its Subsidiaries have used commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain their confidential information and trade secrets in
confidence, including entering into licenses and contracts that generally
require licensees, contractors and other third Persons with access to such trade
secrets to keep such trade secrets confidential. All employees of Quinton and
its


                                       26
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries have entered into valid and binding agreements with Quinton and/or
its Subsidiaries (as the case may be) sufficient to vest title in Quinton or
such Subsidiaries of all Quinton Intellectual Property Rights created by such
employees in the scope of their employment. To the extent that any Quinton
Intellectual Property Rights have been developed or created by a third Party for
Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries, Quinton and/or such Subsidiaries have a
written agreement with such third Party with respect thereto and Quinton and/or
such Subsidiaries thereby either (i) has obtained ownership of, and is the
exclusive owner of, or (ii) has obtained a license (sufficient for the conduct
of its business as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted) to all
such third Party's Intellectual Property in such work, material or invention by
operation of law or by valid assignment, to the fullest extent it is legally
possible to do so.

            (c) Neither Quinton nor any of its Subsidiaries has transferred
ownership of, or granted any exclusive license with respect to, any Quinton
Intellectual Property Rights to any third Party within the last two years.

indemnities in connection with any Quinton Intellectual Property Rights to any
third Party other than indemnities given in the ordinary course of business or
that would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in the loss of, or otherwise adversely affect, any
ownership rights of Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries in any Quinton
Intellectual Property Rights or result in the breach or termination of any
license, contract or agreement to which Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party respecting any Quinton Intellectual Property Rights.

            (f) Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement nor the transfer of any contracts, licenses, agreements or
Quinton Intellectual Property Rights will trigger any provision of any contract,
license or agreement of Quinton or any of its Subsidiaries that purports to
obligate Quinton or such Subsidiary to (i) grant to any third party any rights
or licenses with respect to any Quinton Intellectual Property Rights; or (ii)
increase the royalties or other amounts payable for licenses to Quinton
Intellectual Property Rights in excess of that being paid by Quinton and/or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

            Section 4.20 Finders' Fees; Opinion of Financial Advisor.

            (a) Except for SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ("SunTrust"), there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary who might be entitled to

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based upon

Knowledge of the Cardiac, is there a basis for any such action, suit or claim.
No Cardiac Employee Plan is currently under investigation, audit or review,
directly or indirectly, by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor or any other
governmental entity or agency except as would not be reasonably likely to have a
Cardiac Material Adverse Effect, and, to the Knowledge of the Cardiac, no such
action is contemplated or under consideration by the IRS, the U.S. Department of
Labor or any other Governmental Entity.

            (e) The execution of, and performance of the transactions

welfare benefits to any employee upon such employee's retirement or termination
of employment, except as required by Section 601 of ERISA and Section 4980B of
the Code.

            (g) To the Knowledge of Cardiac, there has been no amendment to,
written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) to create, enter
into, contribute to or otherwise relating to any Cardiac Employee Plan which
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such Cardiac Employee Plans
in the aggregate above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004.

            (h) To the Knowledge of Cardiac, Cardiac and each of its

Affiliate of Cardiac is pending, threatened or reasonably anticipated. Cardiac

any Cardiac employees. There are no Actions pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Cardiac, threatened or reasonably anticipated relating to any labor, safety or
discrimination matters involving any Cardiac employee, including, without

individually or in the aggregate, result in any material liability to Cardiac.
Neither Cardiac nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair labor
practices within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. Neither
Cardiac nor any of its Subsidiaries is presently, or has it been in the past, a
party to, or bound by, any collective bargaining agreement or union contract

its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability or material obligation
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or any similar Law
which remains unsatisfied.

            Section 5.16 Compliance with Laws; Sarbanes-Oxley.

            (a) Cardiac and its Subsidiaries have all material licenses, permits
and qualifications necessary to conduct their businesses and own their
properties in each jurisdiction in which Cardiac or its Subsidiaries currently
do business or own property, or in which such license, permit or qualification
is otherwise required. Cardiac and its Subsidiaries have complied in all
material respects with all Laws applicable to their businesses and the present
use by Cardiac and its Subsidiaries of their respective properties, and the
business conducted by Cardiac and its Subsidiaries, does not violate in any
material respect any such Laws and Cardiac and its Subsidiaries have timely
filed all reports and returns required by Law and all such returns and reports

deficiencies with respect to such filings or submissions.

            (b) Cardiac is in compliance with, and has complied, in all material
respects with (A) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the
Exchange Act and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and
regulations of Nasdaq. There are no outstanding loans made by Cardiac to any of
its executive officers (as defined under Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or
directors. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Cardiac has not made
any loans to any such executive officer or director. Cardiac has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that information relating to Cardiac, required to be
disclosed by Cardiac in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to Cardiac's principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure, and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by Cardiac in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. To the best
of its Knowledge: Cardiac has established and maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act); such internal controls are designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Cardiac's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed,
based on their most recent evaluation, to Cardiac's auditors and the audit
committee of the board of directors of Cardiac (x) all significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over
financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect Cardiac's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial data and have
identified for its auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Cardiac's internal controls. Since January 1,
2003, neither Cardiac, nor to the Knowledge of Cardiac, any director, officer,


                                       38
<PAGE>
employee, auditor, accountant or representative of Cardiac has received or
otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Cardiac or its
internal accounting controls, including any material complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim that Cardiac has engaged in questionable accounting or
auditing practices. For purposes of this paragraph, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to such
terms in the Exchange Act.

            (c) To the Knowledge of Cardiac, no employee of Cardiac has provided
or is providing information to any law enforcement agency regarding the
commission or possible commission of any crime or the violation or possible
violation of any applicable Law. Neither Cardiac nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor or agent of Cardiac or any such
Subsidiaries has discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any
other manner discriminated against an employee of Cardiac or any of its
Subsidiaries in the terms and conditions of employment because of any act of
such employee described in 18 U.S.C. Section 1514A(a).

            Section 5.17 Environmental Matters. (i) No written notice,
notification, demand, request for information, citation, summons, complaint or
order has been received or made by, and no Action is pending or, the Knowledge
of Cardiac, threatened by any Person against Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries,
with respect to any applicable Environmental Law, (ii) Cardiac and its
Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws and (iii) there are no liabilities or obligations
of Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether accrued,
contingent, absolute, direct or indirect, determined, determinable or otherwise,
arising under or relating to any Environmental Law (including, without
limitation, liabilities or obligations relating to divested properties or
businesses or predecessor entities) which would have a Cardiac Material Adverse
Effect, and there are no facts, conditions, situations or set of circumstances
that have resulted or could reasonably be expected to result in or be the basis
for any such liabilities or obligations which would have a Cardiac Material
Adverse Effect.

            Section 5.18 Medical Device Regulatory Compliance.

            (a) All medical devices of Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries that
are subject to regulation by the FDA and other applicable U.S. federal, state or
local regulatory agencies, are manufactured, produced, tested, developed,

            Section 5.19 Intellectual Property.

            (a) All patents and applications therefor and all reissues,
divisions, renewals, extensions, provisionals, continuations and
continuations-in-part thereof; registered trademarks and applications therefor;
and registered copyrights and applications therefor owned or controlled by
Cardiac or its Subsidiaries (collectively, "Cardiac Registered Intellectual
Property"), together with


                                       40
<PAGE>
any other type of rights in Intellectual Property that are owned or controlled
by Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries and that (x) relates to any Cardiac
product or (y) is otherwise material to the research, development, manufacturing
or commercialization of any Cardiac product, are collectively referred to herein
as "Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights". Section 5.19 of the Cardiac
Disclosure Letter lists all Cardiac Registered Intellectual Property. All
Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights are either (i) owned by, or subject to a
valid license or a valid obligation of assignment to, Cardiac or its
Subsidiaries free and clear of all mortgages, liens, security interests, leases,
pledges, encumbrances, equities, claims, charges, options, written restrictions,
rights of first refusal, title retention agreements or other exceptions to title
which affect the Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights or restrict the use by
Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries of the Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights
in any material way ("Cardiac IP Liens"), or (ii) controlled by Cardiac or its
Subsidiaries free and clear (to the Knowledge of Cardiac) of all Cardiac IP
Liens. Cardiac and its Subsidiaries are the sole legal and beneficial owners of
all the Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights. There are no actions pending or,
to the Knowledge of Cardiac, threatened with regard to the ownership or control
by Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries of any of the Cardiac Intellectual
Property Rights. To the Knowledge of Cardiac and its Subsidiaries, the Cardiac
Intellectual Property Rights have not been, and are not being, infringed. To the
Knowledge of Cardiac and its Subsidiaries , the Cardiac Intellectual Property
rights are valid and enforceable. To the Knowledge of Cardiac and its
Subsidiaries, there are no facts or circumstances that could impair the validity
or enforceability of any of the Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights. Neither
Cardiac nor its Subsidiaries has received any communications challenging the
validity or enforceability of the Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights or their
ownership of Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights. There are no pending or, to
the Knowledge of Cardiac or its Subsidiaries, threatened claims that Cardiac or
any of its Subsidiaries has infringed or is infringing (including with respect
to the manufacture, use, sale or importation by Cardiac or any of its
Subsidiaries of any commercial products or to the operations of Cardiac or any
of its Subsidiaries) any Intellectual Property of any Person. To the Knowledge
of Cardiac and its Subsidiaries , there are no patent rights of any third Party
that are known to be dominating, interfering, or potentially dominating or
interfering and that could be asserted by a Person to exclude or prevent Cardiac
or its Subsidiaries or licensees from manufacturing or commercializing their
products. Neither Cardiac nor its Subsidiaries knows of any valid grounds for
any bona fide claim that the conduct of Cardiac's or its Subsidiaries business
will infringe or misappropriate any of the Intellectual Property rights owned by
any other Person.

            (b) Cardiac and its Subsidiaries have used commercially reasonable
efforts to maintain their confidential information and trade secrets in
confidence, including entering into licenses and contracts that generally
require licensees, contractors and other third Persons with access to such trade
secrets to keep such trade secrets confidential. All employees of Cardiac and
its Subsidiaries have entered into valid and binding agreements with Cardiac
and/or its Subsidiaries (as the case may be) sufficient to vest title in Cardiac
or such Subsidiaries of all Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights created by such
employees in the scope of their employment. To the extent that any Cardiac
Intellectual Property Rights have been developed or created by a third Party for
Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries, Cardiac and/or such Subsidiaries have a
written agreement with such third Party with respect thereto and Cardiac and/or
such Subsidiaries thereby either (i) has obtained ownership of, and is the
exclusive owner of, or (ii) has obtained a license (sufficient for the conduct
of its business as currently conducted and as proposed to be conducted) to all
such third Party's Intellectual Property in such work, material or invention by
operation of law or by valid assignment, to the fullest extent it is legally
possible to do so.


                                       41
<PAGE>
            (c) Neither Cardiac nor any of its Subsidiaries has transferred
ownership of, or granted any exclusive license with respect to, any Cardiac
Intellectual Property Rights to any third Party within the last two years.

            (d) Neither Cardiac nor any of its Subsidiaries has given any
indemnities in connection with any Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights to any
third party other than indemnities given in the ordinary course of business or
that would not reasonably be expected to have a Cardiac Material Adverse Effect.

            (e) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in the loss of, or otherwise adversely affect, any
ownership rights of Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries in any Cardiac
Intellectual Property Rights or result in the breach or termination of any
license, contract or agreement to which Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party respecting any Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights.

            (f) Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement nor the transfer of any contracts, licenses, agreements or
Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights will trigger any provision of any contract,
license or agreement of Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries that purports to
obligate Cardiac or such Subsidiary to (i) grant to any third Party any rights
or licenses with respect to any Cardiac Intellectual Property Rights; or (ii)
increase the royalties or other amounts payable for licenses to Cardiac
Intellectual Property Rights in excess of that being paid by Cardiac and/or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

            Section 5.20 Finders' Fees; Opinion of Financial Advisor.

            (a) Except for CIBC World Markets Corp. ("CIBC World Markets"),
there is no investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary who might be
entitled to any fee or commission from Cardiac or any of its respective
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Cardiac.

            (b) The Board of Directors of Cardiac has received the opinion of
CIBC World Markets to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and
subject to the matters stated therein, the Cardiac Exchange Ratio was fair from
a financial point of view to the holders of Cardiac Common Shares (other than
Perseus, LLC and its Affiliates), a copy of which opinion will be made available
to Quinton solely for informational purposes after receipt thereof by Cardiac.

            Section 5.21 Absence of Liens and Encumbrances; Real Property.

            (a) Cardiac and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid title
to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold interests
in, all of its material tangible properties and assets, real, personal and
mixed, used in its business, free and clear of any Liens except as reflected in
the Cardiac Financial Statements and except for Liens for Taxes not yet
delinquent and such imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, which would
not be material to Cardiac.

            (b) Neither Cardiac nor any Subsidiary of Cardiac owns any real
property. Section 5.21 of the Cardiac Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all
properties leased or otherwise occupied by Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries
for the operation of its business, including the address, the name of the
landlord, and the current base rent (the "Cardiac Facilities"). Section 5.21 of
the Cardiac Disclosure Letter identifies all of the leases or other occupancy
agreements with respect to


                                       42
<PAGE>
the Cardiac Facilities (the "Cardiac Leases") and any amendments or
modifications to the Cardiac Leases. No party other than Cardiac, its
Subsidiaries or a subtenant identified in Section 5.21 of the Cardiac Disclosure
Letter, as applicable, has the right to occupy any of the Cardiac Facilities.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Cardiac do not, and the
performance of this Agreement by Cardiac will not, result in any breach of, or
constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both
would become a default) under, or impair Cardiac's rights or alter the rights or
obligations of any third party under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any Cardiac Lease.

            Section 5.22 Agreements, Contracts and Commitments. Except as filed
as an exhibit to the Cardiac SEC Documents, neither Cardiac nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound by:

            (a) any employment or consulting agreement, contract or commitment
with any executive officer or director, other than those that are terminable by
Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries on no more than thirty (30) days' notice
without liability or financial obligation to Cardiac;

            (b) any agreement or plan, including, without limitation, any stock

Agreement or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the
basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

            (c) any agreement of indemnification or any guaranty other than any
agreement of indemnification entered into in the ordinary course of business,
that would not reasonably be expected to have a Cardiac Material Adverse Effect,
or any guaranty of the obligations of a Subsidiary of Cardiac;

            (d) any agreement, contract or commitment containing any covenant
limiting in any respect the right of Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries to
engage in any line of business or to compete with any person or which limits
Cardiac's access to certain segments of a specified market;

            (e) any agreement, contract or commitment currently in force
relating to the disposition or acquisition by Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries
after the date of this Agreement of a material amount of assets not in the
ordinary course of business or pursuant to which Cardiac has any material
ownership interest in any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business enterprise other than Cardiac's Subsidiaries;

            (f) any dealer, distributor, joint marketing or development
agreement currently in force under which Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries have
continuing material obligations to jointly market any product, technology or

twenty (120) days or less, or any material agreement pursuant to which Cardiac
or any of its Subsidiaries have continuing material obligations to jointly
develop any intellectual property that will not be owned, in whole or in part,
by Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries and which may not be canceled without
penalty upon notice of one hundred twenty (120) days or less;


                                       43

will, if fulfilled in accordance with its terms, result in payments being made
by Cardiac in excess of $1,000,000 in the calendar year ending December 31,

      Neither Cardiac nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to Cardiac's Knowledge
any other party to a Cardiac Contract (as defined below), is in breach,
violation or default under, and neither Cardiac nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice that it has breached, violated or defaulted under, any
of the material terms or conditions of any of the agreements, contracts or
commitments to which Cardiac or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
it is bound that are either filed as an exhibit to any Cardiac SEC Document or
required to be disclosed in the Cardiac Disclosure Letter (any such agreement,
contract or commitment, a "Cardiac Contract") in such a manner as would permit
any other party to cancel or terminate any such Cardiac Contract, or would
permit any other party to seek material damages or other remedies (for any or
all of such breaches, violations or defaults, in the aggregate).

            Section 5.23 Customers and Suppliers. None of the ten (10) largest

relationship with Cardiac, or its usage of the services or products of Cardiac,
and to the Knowledge of Cardiac, no such customer or supplier intends to cancel
or otherwise terminate its relationship with Cardiac or to materially decrease
its usage of the services or products of Cardiac, as the case may be. Cardiac

intended by the parties, any agreement with, or engaged in any fraudulent
conduct with respect to, any customer or supplier of Cardiac. Section 5.23 of

<PAGE>
will withhold their consent to the inclusion, or incorporation by reference, of
their audit opinion concerning Cardiac's financial statements which are to be
included in the Registration Statement.

            Section 5.25 Nasdaq Qualification. Cardiac meets the independent
director and audit committee requirements set forth in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule

shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the Quinton Stockholder
Approval.

            Section 7.3 Cardiac Stockholders Meeting. Cardiac shall cause a
meeting of its stockholders (the "Cardiac Stockholders Meeting") to be duly
called and held for the purpose of obtaining the Cardiac Stockholder Approval as
soon as reasonably practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Except as provided in Section 7.4, (a)
Cardiac's Board of Directors shall recommend approval and adoption by its
stockholders of this Agreement (the "Cardiac Recommendation"), and (b) Cardiac
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit the Cardiac Stockholder
Approval.

            Section 7.4 Acquisition Proposals; Board Recommendation.

            (a) Each of Quinton and Cardiac agrees that it shall not, nor shall
it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or knowingly permit
any officer, director, employee, investment banker, attorney, accountant, agent
or other advisor or representative of such party or any of its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to (i) take any action to solicit, initiate or
facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage
in any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any non-public
information with respect to, or take any other action knowingly to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may be
reasonably expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) grant any waiver
or release under any standstill or similar agreement with respect to any class
of such party's equity securities or (iv) other than in the manner contemplated
by Section 7.4(d), enter into any agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that each of Quinton and Cardiac may take any
actions described in the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) in respect
of any Person who makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, but only if (x)
such party's Board of Directors, after consultation with its investment advisors
and outside legal counsel, determines in its good faith judgment that either (A)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and provides written
notice of termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.4(d) and
Section 10.1, or (B) such Acquisition Proposal could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal, and (y) prior to furnishing any non-public
information to such Person, such Person shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement


                                       48
<PAGE>
with Quinton or Cardiac, as the case may be, on terms no less favorable to the
such party than the terms of the Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated July 7,
2004, between Quinton and Cardiac, agreeing to keep confidential any non-public
information received. In addition to the foregoing requirements, the Board of
Directors of such party shall be prohibited from taking such actions with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal unless the Board of Directors determines,
after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under the DGCL. In addition to the
foregoing, such party shall (i) provide the other party with at least
forty-eight (48) hours prior notice (or such lesser prior notice as provided to
the members of such party's Board of Directors) of any meeting of such party's
Board of Directors at which such party's Board of Directors is reasonably
expected to consider an Acquisition Proposal and (ii) provide the other party
with the same prior written notice of a meeting of such party's Board of
Directors at which such party's Board of Directors is reasonably expected to
recommend a Superior Proposal to its stockholders as is provided to such party's
Board of Directors together with a copy of the definitive documentation relating
to such Superior Proposal.

            (b) Until this Agreement shall have been terminated pursuant to
Section 7.4(d), neither party's Board of Directors nor any committee thereof
shall recommend any Acquisition Proposal to such party's stockholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 7.4(b) or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent either party's Board of Directors from
(i) complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal or making any disclosure required by applicable Law
or (ii) withdrawing the Quinton Recommendation or Cardiac Recommendation, as the
case may be, if, after consulting with its outside legal counsel, the failure to
do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under the DGCL.

            (c) Promptly (but in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours)
after receipt by either party or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective directors, officers, agents or advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal,
any request for non-public information or for access to the properties, books or
records of such party or any of its Subsidiaries or any request for a waiver or
release under any standstill or similar agreement, by any Person that has made
an Acquisition Proposal or indicates that it is considering making an
Acquisition Proposal, such party shall notify the other party (x) that a Person
may be considering making an Acquisition Proposal, and (y) of the identity of
such Person and, if an Acquisition Proposal is made, of the material terms of
such Acquisition Proposal. Each party shall keep the other party reasonably
informed of the status and material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal.

            (d) Upon notice and in accordance with the terms of Section 10.1,
and subject to Section 10.4(c), either party may terminate this Agreement at any
time before the Quinton Stockholder Approval or Cardiac Stockholder Approval, as
applicable, is obtained if (i) such party's Board of Directors shall have
authorized such party, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to
enter into a binding agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (ii) such party notifies the other party that it intends to
enter into such agreement, specifying the material terms and conditions of such
agreement, and (iii) within five Business Days of receiving the notice described
in (ii) above, the other party fails to propose and agree to enter into a
modification of this Agreement or, after proposing to enter into a modification
to this Agreement within such five Business Day period, such party's Board of
Directors determines by a majority vote in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with its investment advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal previously determined to constitute a Superior Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal.

other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any
stay or temporary restraining order entered by any Governmental Entity vacated

separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business in a specified manner,
or agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business
in a specified manner, or permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition
of, any assets of such party or the conduct of its business in a specified
manner, whether as a condition to obtaining any approval from a Governmental
Entity or any other Person or for any other reason (any such sale, holding
separate or other disposition or conduct of business shall be referred to herein
as a "Burdensome Condition").

            Section 8.2 Public Announcements. The parties shall consult with
each other before issuing, and provide each other a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon, any press release or public statement with respect to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and, except as may be
required by applicable Law or any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange, will not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation; provided, however, that neither party
shall be required to consult with the other party with respect to the inclusion
in any press release or public statement of any information that is the same as,
or substantially similar to, information previously disclosed in compliance with
this Section 8.2.

            Section 8.3 Access to Information; Notification of Certain Matters.

of the other party in its investigation. Any investigation pursuant to this
Section 8.3(a) shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the other party. All such
information shall be deemed proprietary information of the delivering party, and
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, be kept confidential by the
receiving party and not used other than in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 8.3(a) shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereunder.

            (b) Each party hereto shall give notice to each other party hereto,

such party to, any Governmental Entity in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated hereby;

                  (ii) any notice or other communication from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

                  (iii) any fact, or of the occurrence or impending occurrence
of any event or circumstance, relating to it or any of its Subsidiaries which
would be reasonably likely to cause a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement by such party or which has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on such party; provided,
however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 8.3(b) shall
not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

            Section 8.4 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Holding Company will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of Quinton and Cardiac, any deeds, bills of

Quinton and Cardiac, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in Holding Company and Cardiac Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets of Quinton and Cardiac, as the case may be, acquired or to be acquired by
Holding Company and Cardiac Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in
connection with, the Mergers.

            Section 8.5 Tax Matters. Quinton and Cardiac will use their

such steps reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated hereby
and any other acquisitions of equity securities of Holding Company (including

Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

            (a) Holding Company shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless, and

Subsidiaries (in all of their capacities) (a) to the same extent such persons
are indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of

(ii) include and cause to be maintained in effect in Holding Company's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws after the Effective Time, provisions

least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no
less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that in
no event shall Holding Company be required to expend an amount in excess of two
hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium currently paid by Quinton for such

beneficiaries of this Section 8.7(a)).

transactions contemplated hereby), (ii) include and cause to be maintained in
effect in the Cardiac Surviving Corporation's certificate of incorporation and
bylaws after the Effective Time, provisions regarding elimination of liability
of directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses which are no less advantageous to the intended
beneficiaries than the corresponding provisions contained in the current
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Cardiac and (iii) (A) cause to be
maintained for a period of six years after the Effective Time the current
policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by Cardiac (provided that Holding Company (or any
successor) may substitute therefor one or more policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events
that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided,


                                       52
<PAGE>
however, that in no event shall Holding Company be required to expend in excess
of two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium currently paid by Cardiac
for such insurance; and, provided further that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, Cardiac shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount, or (B) provide tail coverage for such persons covered by current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by Cardiac,
which tail coverage shall provide coverage or six (6) years for acts prior to
the Effective Time or terms no less favorable than the terms of such current
insurance coverage. The obligations of Holding Company under this Section 8.7(b)
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
indemnitee to whom this Section 8.7(b) applies without the consent of such
affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this
Section 8.7 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 8.7(b)).

            (b) by either Quinton or Cardiac, if

                  (i) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the
Mergers illegal or otherwise prohibited or any judgment, injunction, order or
decree of any Governmental Entity having competent jurisdiction enjoining
Quinton or Cardiac from consummating the Mergers is entered and such judgment,
injunction, judgment or order shall have become final and nonappealable and,
prior to such termination, the parties shall have used their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to resist, resolve or lift, as applicable, such
Law, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree; provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b)(i) shall not be
available to any party whose breach of any provision of or whose failure to

after notice of such breach or failure to perform has been given by Quinton to
Cardiac;

            (d) by Cardiac, if a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Quinton set forth in this Agreement shall

satisfied or such breach or failure to perform has not been cured within 30 days
after notice of such breach or failure to perform has been given by Cardiac to

this Agreement, the parties hereto agree that any suit, action or proceeding
seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in
connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be
brought in a state court located in Portland, Oregon, and each of the parties
hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of the
appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection
which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit,
action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or
proceeding which is brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served

of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party agrees that
service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.2 shall be deemed

equity.

agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,

the prevailing party shall recover all of such party's attorneys' fees incurred
in each and every such action, suit or other proceeding, including any and all
appeals or petitions therefrom. As used in this Section 11.10, attorneys' fees
shall be deemed to mean the full and actual costs of any legal services actually
performed in connection with the matters involved calculated on the basis of the
usual fee charged by the attorney performing such services and shall not be
limited to "reasonable attorneys' fees" as defined in any statute or rule of
court.
