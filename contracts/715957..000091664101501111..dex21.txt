AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement")
dated as of September 9, 2001, is among DOMINION RESOURCES, INC., a Virginia
corporation ("Parent"), CONSOLIDATED NATURAL GAS COMPANY, a Delaware
corporation and a direct and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Sub"), and
LOUIS DREYFUS NATURAL GAS CORP., an Oklahoma corporation (the
"Company").     RECITALS   A. The respective Boards of Directors of each
of Parent, Sub and the Company have determined that the merger of the Company
with and into Sub (the "Merger"), in the manner contemplated herein, is
advisable and in the best interests of their respective corporations and
shareholders, and, by resolutions duly adopted, have approved and adopted
this Agreement.   B. It is intended for federal income tax purposes that the
Merger qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations").   C. As a
condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent to enter into this
Agreement, certain principal shareholders of the Company have entered into an
agreement with Parent and Sub pursuant to which such shareholders have
(i) agreed, among other things, to vote their Company Shares in favor of the
Merger and (ii) granted to Parent and Sub an irrevocable proxy to vote their
Company Shares upon the terms and conditions set forth therein (the
"Principal Shareholders Agreement").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:  
ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   Section 1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section
1.3), the Company shall be merged with and into Sub in accordance with this
Agreement, and the separate corporate existence of the Company shall
thereupon cease. Sub (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving
Corporation") shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger and shall be a
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. The Merger shall have the effects
specified in the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") and the Oklahoma
General Corporation Act (the "OGCA"). At the election of Parent, any direct
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a constituent
corporation in the Merger. In such event, the parties hereto agree to execute
an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect such
substitution.    Section 1.2 The Closing. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place (i) at the offices of McGuireWoods LLP, One James Center,
Richmond, Virginia, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on the first business day
immediately following the day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of
the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to fulfillment
or waiver of those conditions) shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance
herewith or (ii) at such other time, date or place as Parent and the Company
may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter
referred to as the "Closing Date."   Section 1.3 Effective Time. If all the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VII shall have been fulfilled
or waived in accordance herewith and this Agreement shall not have been
terminated as provided in Article VIII, on the Closing Date, certificates of
merger (the "Certificates of Merger") meeting the requirements of Section 251
of the DGCL and Section 1082 of the OGCA shall be properly executed and filed
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Secretary of
State of the State of Oklahoma, respectively. The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Certificates of Merger with the Secretaries
of State of the State of Delaware and Oklahoma in accordance with the DGCL
and the OGCA, or at such later time that the parties hereto shall have agreed
upon and designated in such filing as the effective time of the Merger (the
"Effective Time").   Section 1.4 Certificate of Incorporation. The
certificate of incorporation of Sub in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until duly amended in accordance with applicable law.  
Section 1.5 Bylaws. The bylaws of Sub in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until
duly amended in accordance with applicable law.   Section 1.6 Board of
Directors and Officers. The board of directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall consist of the board of directors of Sub, as it existed immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The officers of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE
II  CONVERSION OF COMPANY SHARES   Section 2.1 Effect On Capital Stock. At
the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the following effects on the
capital stock of the Company and Sub, without any action on the part of the
holder of any capital stock of the Company or Sub:   (a) Conversion of the
Company Shares. Subject to the provisions of this 
-------------------------------- Section 2.1 and Section 2.3, each share of
common stock, $0.01 par value, of the Company (each a "Company Share" and
collectively the "Company Shares") issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (but not including any Dissenting Shares (as defined
below) and any Company Shares that are owned by (i) Parent, Sub or any other
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent or (ii) by the Company (the "Excluded
Company Shares")) shall, by virtue of the Merger   -2-   and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to
receive (i) $20.00 in cash (the "Cash Consideration"), (ii) 0.3226
(the "Exchange Ratio") of a Parent Common Share (the "Share Consideration"
and, together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration") and
(iii), in the event the Effective Time does not occur on or before the record
date for the regular quarterly dividend on Parent Common Shares payable in
December 2001 (the "December 2001 Dividend") and/or March 2002 (the "March
2002 Dividend"), as the case may be, and such failure was not the result of a
failure by the Company to perform or observe in any material respect any of
its obligations under this Agreement, an amount in cash equal to the December
2001 Dividend and/or the March 2002 Dividend, as the case may be, payable in
respect of a Parent Common Share multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (which sum
shall be part of the Cash Consideration). "Parent Common Share" shall mean
the common shares, no par value, of Parent.   (b) Cancellation of Excluded
Company Shares. Each Excluded Company 
--------------------------------------- Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, no longer be
outstanding, shall be canceled and retired without payment of
any consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.   (c) Sub. At the
Effective Time, each share of common stock, $2.75 par  --- value, of Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding as shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and the
Surviving Corporation shall continue as a wholly owned subsidiary
of Parent.   Section 2.2 Exchange of Certificates for Shares.   (a)
Exchange Procedures. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall 
------------------- designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as agent for the holders of Company Shares in
connection with the Merger (the "Exchange Agent") to receive the Merger
Consideration to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant
to Section 2.1(a). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will deposit with the
Exchange Agent certificates representing Parent Common Shares and cash
sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Sections 2.1(a) and 2.2(d) and,
when and as needed, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent cash
sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.2(b). As promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record as of the Effective Time
of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
Company Shares (each a "Certificate") (other than holders of a Certificate in
respect of Excluded Company Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying
that delivery of the Certificates shall be effected, and that risk of loss
and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or, in lieu of such Certificates, affidavits of loss
together with either a reasonable undertaking to indemnify Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, if Parent believes that the person providing the
indemnity is sufficiently creditworthy, or, if Parent does not so believe,
indemnity bonds) to the Exchange Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for exchanging the
Certificates and receiving the Merger Consideration to which such holder
shall be entitled therefor pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Subject to Section
2.2(g), upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to   -3-   receive in exchange
therefor (i) a certificate representing that number of whole Parent Common
Shares that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) and
(ii) a check in the aggregate amount (after giving effect to any required tax
withholdings) of (A) the cash that such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.1(a) plus (B) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
determined in accordance with Section 2.2(d) plus (C) any cash dividends and
any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right
to receive pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.2(b). The Certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of any Certificate. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Shares that occurred prior to the
Effective Time, but is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
the Merger Consideration may be issued and/or paid to such a transferee if
the Certificate formerly representing such Company Shares is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect
such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. If any certificate for Parent Common Shares is to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the
Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the issuance of certificates for Parent Common Shares
in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange
Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (b) Distributions
with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. Whenever a 
------------------------------------------------ dividend or other
distribution is declared by Parent in respect of Parent Common Shares, the
record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration
shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all Parent
Common Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or
other distributions so declared in respect of such Parent Common Shares shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until such Certificate
is surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.2. Subject to
the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such Certificate,
there shall be issued or paid, less the amount of any withholding taxes that
may be required thereon, to the holder of the certificates representing whole
Parent Common Shares issued in exchange for such Certificate, without
interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other
distributions with a record date that is at or after the Effective Time and a
payment date on or prior to the date of surrender of such whole Parent Common
Shares and not previously paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole Parent
Common Shares with a record date at or after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender. For purposes of dividends or other
distributions in respect of Parent Common Shares, all Parent Common Shares to
be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of
the Effective Time.   (c) Transfers. After the Effective Time, there shall
be no transfers on  --------- the stock transfer books of the Company of the
Company Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   (d) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip or Parent
Common  -------------------- Shares representing fractional Parent Common
Shares shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates and
such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights of a shareholder of Parent or a holder of Parent Common
Shares. Notwithstanding   -4-   any other provision of this Agreement,
each holder of Company Shares exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Common Share
(after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a Parent Common Share multiplied by
(ii) the closing price of Parent Common Shares as reported on the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape on the Closing Date.   (e)
Termination of Exchange Period; Unclaimed Merger Consideration. Any 
-------------------------------------------------------------- Parent Common
Shares and any portion of the cash, dividends or other distributions with
respect to the Parent Common Shares deposited by Parent with the Exchange
Agent (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remain
unclaimed by the shareholders of the Company 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be paid to Parent upon demand. Any shareholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter be entitled to look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and other similar laws) for payment of their Merger Consideration and
any cash, dividends and other distributions in respect thereof issuable
and/or payable pursuant to Section 2.1, Section 2.2(b) and Section 2.2(d)
upon due surrender of their Certificates (or, in lieu of such Certificates,
affidavits of loss together with either a reasonable undertaking to indemnify
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, if Parent believes that the Person
providing the indemnity is sufficiently creditworthy, or, if Parent does not
so believe, indemnity bonds), in each case, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Company Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.   (f)
Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any 
-------------------------------------- Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and if
Parent believes that the Person providing the indemnity is sufficiently
creditworthy, the making of a reasonable undertaking to indemnify Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, or, if Parent does not so believe, the posting by
such Person of a bond in the form customarily required by Parent to indemnify
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, Parent will issue the Parent Common Shares and the Exchange
Agent will distribute such Merger Consideration, dividends and
other distributions in respect thereof issuable or payable in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1, Section
2.2(b) and Section 2.2(d), in each case, without interest.   (g)
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the 
---------- contrary, Certificates surrendered for exchange by any Rule 145
Affiliate (as determined pursuant to Section 6.8) of the Company shall not be
exchanged until Parent has received a written agreement from such Person as
provided in Section 6.8.   Section 2.3 Dissenters\' Rights. Company Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are
held by shareholders who shall have not voted in favor of the Merger and who
shall have made written demand for payment of the fair value for such shares
in accordance with Section 1091 of the OGCA (collectively, the "Dissenting
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. Such shareholders shall be entitled to receive payment
of the fair value of the Company Shares held by   -5-   them in
accordance with the OGCA, except that all Dissenting Shares held
by shareholders who shall have failed to perfect or who effectively shall
have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such Company Shares under
the OGCA shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to
be exchangeable, as of the Effective Time, for Merger Consideration in the
manner provided in Section 2.1(a).   Section 2.4 Adjustments to Prevent
Dilution. In the event that prior to the Effective Time, there shall have
been declared or effected a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse split), stock dividend, stock distribution or similar event made with
respect to the Company Shares or the Parent Common Shares, the Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such event.   ARTICLE
III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY   Except as publicly
disclosed by the Company in the Company Reports (as defined in Section 3.7)
filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement and except as set
forth in the disclosure letter (each section of which qualifies the
correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the
extent specified therein, provided that any disclosure set forth with 
-------- respect to any particular section shall be deemed to be disclosed in
reference to all other applicable sections of this Agreement if the
disclosure in respect of the particular section is sufficient on its face
without further inquiry reasonably to inform Parent of the information
required to be disclosed in respect of the other sections to avoid a breach
under the representation and warranty or covenant corresponding to such other
sections) previously delivered by the Company to Parent (the "Company
Disclosure Letter"), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as
follows:   Section 3.1 Existence; Good Standing; Corporate Authority. The
Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Oklahoma. The Company is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business
makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 9.10). The Company has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted. The copies of the Company\'s articles
of incorporation and bylaws previously made available to Parent are true
and correct and contain all amendments as of the date hereof.   Section 3.2
Authorization, Validity and Effect of Agreements. The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement
and all other agreements and documents contemplated hereby, to which it is a
party. The consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate
action, other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval and adoption of
this Agreement by the Company\'s shareholders. Assuming the valid
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Sub,
this Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to  
-6-   applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting or relating to creditors\' rights generally or general principles
of equity.   Section 3.3 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 100,000,000 Company Shares, and 10,000,000 shares of the
Company preferred stock, $0.01 par value ("Company Preferred Stock"). As of
August 31, 2001, there were (i) 43,758,077 Company Shares issued and
outstanding (excluding 359,315 treasury shares), (ii) no shares of Company
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and (iii) 1,911,552 Company Shares
subject to outstanding employee or director stock options, of which the
weighted average exercise price was approximately $23.30 per share. All
issued and outstanding Company Shares (i) are duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, (ii) were
not issued in violation of the terms of any agreement or other understanding
binding upon the Company and (iii) were issued in compliance with all
applicable charter documents of the Company and all applicable federal and
state securities laws, rules and regulations. Except as set forth in this
Section 3.3 and except for any Company Shares issued pursuant to the plans
listed in Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the date of
this Agreement there are no outstanding shares of capital stock and there are
no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, shareholder rights plan
or similar instruments, convertible securities, or other rights, agreements
or commitments which obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company has no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of
which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company
on any matter on which the shareholders of the Company are entitled to
vote.   Section 3.4 Subsidiaries. Section 3.4 of the Company Disclosure
Letter sets forth for each Subsidiary of the Company, its name and
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization and indicates whether such
Subsidiary is a Significant Subsidiary, in each case as of the date of this
Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, "Significant Subsidiary" shall
mean significant subsidiary as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or
partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (where
applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, has the corporate or partnership power and authority to own,
operate and lease its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in
good standing or to have such power and authority would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
(where applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the ownership, operation or
lease of its property or the conduct of its business requires
such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or to be in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company free and
clear of all liens, pledges, security interests, claims, preferential
purchase rights or other rights, interests or encumbrances ("Liens"). Other
than joint ventures, operating agreements and similar arrangements typical in
the Company\'s industry entered into in the ordinary course of business,
neither the Company nor any of the   -7-   Company\'s Subsidiaries
directly or indirectly owns any equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any other
person that would reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and
the Company\'s Subsidiaries taken as a whole.   Section 3.5 No Violation.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, or has received notice
that it would be with the passage of time, in violation of any term,
condition or provision of (i) its charter documents or bylaws, (ii) any loan
or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement,
lease, license or other instrument or (iii) any order of any court,
governmental authority or arbitration board or tribunal, or any
law, ordinance, governmental rule or regulation to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets is
subject, or is delinquent with respect to any report required to be filed
with any governmental entity, except, in the case of matters described in
clause (ii) or (iii), as would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except
where it would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its
Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders,
franchises and approvals of all governmental authorities necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the "Company Permits") and the
Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Company
Permits. No investigation by any governmental authority with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, other than those that would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 3.6 No Conflict.   (a) Neither the execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement nor the consummation by the Company
of the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof
will: (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of the
charter documents or bylaws of the Company; (ii) violate, or conflict with,
or result in a breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an
event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) under, or result in the termination or in a right of termination or
cancellation of, or give rise to a right of purchase under, or accelerate the
performance required by, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties of the Company or its Subsidiaries under, or result in being
declared void, voidable, or without further binding effect, or otherwise
result in the loss of a material benefit to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries under any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, Company Permit, lease,
contract, agreement, joint venture or other instrument or obligation to which

authorizations required pursuant to applicable Environmental Laws required to
operate or use any of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' material assets
for their current purposes or uses.   (d) Hazardous Substances have not

Subsidiaries are in compliance with any applicable law, rule or regulation of
any United States federal, state, local or foreign government or agency

No notice, charge, claim, action or assertion has been received by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Company\'s knowledge, has been
filed, commenced or threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
alleging any such violation, in each case that would reasonably be expected

not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no representation or warranty in this Section 3.14 is made with respect to
permits   -15-   issued under or matters relating to Environmental Laws,
which are covered exclusively by the provisions set forth in Section 3.13, or

a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except in the ordinary course of
business, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted to any
other person any license to use any of the foregoing. The conduct of the
Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' respective businesses as currently
conducted does not conflict with any patents, patent rights, licenses
(including seismic licenses), trademarks, trademark rights, trade names,
trade name rights or copyrights of others in a way which would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. There is no infringement of any proprietary right owned by or

Material Adverse Effect, the factual, non-interpretive data on which the
Company Reserve Report was based for purposes of estimating the oil and gas
reserves set forth in the Company Reserve Report was accurate in all material
respects.   Section 3.17 Financial and Commodity Hedging. The Company
Reports accurately summarize, in all material respects the outstanding

agreement or other arrangement that would, after the Effective Time, to the
knowledge of the Company, materially limit or restrict Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or any successor thereto,
from engaging or competing in the oil and gas   -16-   exploration and
production business in any significant geographic area, except for joint
ventures, area of mutual interest agreements entered into in connection with
prospect reviews and similar arrangements entered into in the ordinary course
of business.   (c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or bound by (i) any non-competition agreement, confidentiality,

its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, is conducted or (ii) any executory
agreement or obligation which pertains to the acquisition or disposition of
any asset, or which provides any third party any lien, claim, right of first
refusal or first offer or preferential right with regard thereto, except, in
the case of either clause (i) or (ii), for such agreements or obligations
that would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d) Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has received any material advance, take-or-pay,
production or other similar payments that entitle purchasers of production to
receive deliveries of hydrocarbons without paying therefor, and, on a net,
Company-wide basis, the Company is neither materially underproduced nor
overproduced under gas balancing or similar arrangements.   (e) There are no
contracts, agreements or binding arrangements between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and S. A. Louis Dreyfus et Cie or any of
its affiliates, on the other hand.   Section 3.19 Title to Properties.

owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries, and to all other properties,
interests in properties and assets, real and personal, reflected in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2000 (the "2000
10-K"), free and clear of any Lien, except: (i) Liens reflected in the 2000
10-K; (ii) Liens for current taxes not yet due and payable; and (iii) such
imperfections of title, easements, Liens, or other matters and failures

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The leases and other
agreements pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases or
otherwise acquires or obtains operating rights affecting any real or personal
property are in good standing, valid, and effective except where the failure
to be in good standing, valid and effective would not, individually or the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;
and there is not, under any such leases, any existing or prospective default
or event of default or event which with notice or lapse of time, or both,
would constitute a default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All
operating equipment of the Company and its Subsidiaries has in all material
respects been maintained in reasonable operating condition and repair,
ordinary wear and tear excepted, and is in all material respects sufficient
to permit the Company and its Subsidiaries to conduct their operations in the
ordinary course of business in a manner consistent with their past practices,
except for any such deficiency as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No claim, notice or order from any
Governmental Authority has been received by the Company or   -17-   any
Subsidiary due to hydrocarbon production in excess of allowables or
similar violations which could result in curtailment of production after the
Closing Date, reformation, amendment, cancellation or other alteration of any
unit or taking (whether permanent, temporary, whole, or partial) of any part
of the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary by reason of eminent domain
or otherwise, except any such violations which would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. There are no wells on any lease in which the Company
currently has or previously had an interest that have been permanently
plugged and abandoned that were not plugged and abandoned in accordance in
all material respects with applicable laws or contracts, except any such
violations which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has the
ability and right to obtain access to, produce, treat, transport, process and
otherwise market hydrocarbons from all of the oil and gas properties for
which reserves are shown in the Company Reserve Report, except any such
inability which would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   Section 3.20

adequate and customary in the industry for the operation of their respective

AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB   Except as publicly disclosed by Parent in
the Parent Reports (as defined in Section 4.6) filed with the SEC prior to
the date of this Agreement and except as set forth in the disclosure letter
(each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation
and warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein, provided that any
disclosure set forth with respect to any  -------- particular section shall
be deemed to be disclosed in reference to all other applicable sections of
this Agreement if the disclosure in respect of the particular section is
sufficient on its face without further inquiry reasonably to inform the
Company of the information required to be disclosed in respect of the other
sections to avoid a breach under the representation and warranty or covenant
corresponding to such other sections) previously delivered by Parent to the
Company (the "Parent Disclosure Letter"), Parent and Sub hereby represent and
warrant to the Company as follows:   Section 4.1 Existence; Good Standing;
Corporate Authority. Parent is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
Sub is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing

qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing
under the laws of any jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business
makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect
(as defined in Section 9.10). Each of Parent and Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own, operate and lease its properties and to
carry on its business as now conducted. As of the date hereof, the copies of
each of Parent\'s and Sub\'s   -19-   certificate of incorporation and
bylaws previously made available to the Company are true and correct and
contain all amendments.   Section 4.2 Authorization, Validity and Effect of

documents contemplated hereby, to which it is a party. The consummation by
each of Parent and Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
issuance and delivery by Parent of Parent Common Shares pursuant to the
Merger, has been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action. Assuming
the valid authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, this Agreement constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation
of each of Parent and Sub, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting or relating to creditors\' rights generally and general principles
of equity.   Section 4.3 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of

its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of Parent. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent
has no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders
of which have the right to vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable
for securities having the right to vote) with the shareholders of Parent on
any matter.   Section 4.4 No Violation. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or has received notice that it would be with the passage of
time, in violation of any term, condition or provision of (i) its charter

required to be filed with any governmental entity, except, in the case

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, or by which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound or affected; or
(iii) subject to the governmental filings and other matters referred to in
paragraph (b) of this Section 4.5, contravene or conflict with or constitute
a violation of any provision of any law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or
decree binding upon or applicable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries,
except, in the case of matters described in clause (ii) or (iii), as would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.   (b) Neither the execution and delivery by
Parent or Sub of this Agreement nor the consummation by Parent or Sub of the
transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms hereof will
require any consent, approval or authorization of, or filing or registration
with, any governmental or regulatory authority, other than Regulatory
Filings, and listing of the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger

the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements,

furnishing material non-public information) any inquiry, proposal or offer,
whether or not in writing (including any proposal or offer to its
shareholders), with respect to a third party tender offer,
merger, consolidation, business combination or similar transaction involving
all or more than 10% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole or 10% or more of any class of capital stock of the Company, or
any acquisition, directly or indirectly, of 10% or more of the capital stock
or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in a single
transaction or a series of related transactions, or   -26-   any
combination of the foregoing (any such proposal, offer or transaction
being hereinafter referred to as a "Company Acquisition Proposal"), (B)

clause (i) above shall prohibit the Company or its board of directors from
disclosing to the Company\'s shareholders a position with respect to a tender
offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act, provided that the board of directors of the Company shall
not recommend that the shareholders of the Company tender their
Company Shares in connection with any such tender or exchange offer unless
the board of directors shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that the
relevant Company Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (B) prior to
the Shareholders\' Meeting, if the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide
written Company Acquisition Proposal from a third party that the board of
directors of the Company determines in good faith (after receiving the advice
of a financial adviser of nationally recognized reputation) is reasonably
likely to be a Superior Proposal (as defined below), the Company and its
representatives may conduct such discussions or provide such information as
the board of directors of the Company shall determine, but only if, prior to
such provision of information or conduct of such discussions (x) such third
party shall have entered into a confidentiality agreement not materially less
favorable to the Company than the existing confidentiality agreement dated
June 5, 2001, between the Parent and the Company (the "Parent/Company
Confidentiality Agreement") (and containing additional provisions that
expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of this Section
6.1) and (y) the board of directors of the Company determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required
to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any unsolicited bona fide written
Company Acquisition Proposal which (i) contemplates (A) a merger or other
business combination, reorganization, share exchange,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, tender offer, exchange offer or
similar transaction involving the Company as a result of which the Company\'s
shareholders prior to such transaction in the aggregate cease to own at least
50% of the voting securities of the ultimate parent entity resulting from
such transaction or (B) a sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other
disposition (including, without limitation, a contribution to a joint
venture) of at least 50% of the value of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) is on terms which the board of
directors of the Company determines (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside counsel), taking into account, among other things, all
legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person
making the proposal, (A) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that
is more favorable to its shareholders from a financial point of view (in
their capacities as such) than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the terms of any proposal by the Parent to modify
the terms of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (B) is
reasonably likely to be financed and otherwise completed without undue
delay.   -27-    (b) The Company will promptly (but in any event within
24 hours) notify Parent of any requests referred to in Section 6.1(a) for
information or the receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, including the
identity of the person or group engaging in such discussions or negotiations,
requesting such information or making such Company Acquisition Proposal, and
the material terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal, and
shall keep Parent informed on a timely basis (but in any event within 24
hours) of any material changes with respect thereto. Prior to taking any
action referred to in the proviso of Section 6.1(a), if the Company intends
to participate in any such discussions or negotiations or provide any such
information to any such third party, the Company shall give prompt prior
notice to Parent of each such action.   (c) Nothing in this Section 6.1
shall permit the Company to enter into any agreement with respect to a
Company Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement, it being
agreed that, during the term of this Agreement, the Company shall not enter
into any agreement with any person that provides for, or in any way
facilitates, a Company Acquisition Proposal, other than a confidentiality
agreement not materially less favorable to the Company than
the Parent/Company Confidentiality Agreement.   Section 6.2 Shareholders\'
Meeting. The Company, acting through its board of directors, shall, in
accordance with applicable law and the Company\'s Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws, (i) duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its shareholders as soon as practicable following the date hereof
for the purpose of considering and taking action on this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Shareholders\' Meeting") and
(ii) subject to its fiduciary duties under applicable law after consultation
with outside counsel, (A) include in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as
defined in Section 6.6) the unanimous recommendation of the board of
directors that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
(B) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the necessary approval and
adoption of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by its

party in advance and, to the extent permitted  by such governmental
authority, gives the other party the opportunity  to attend and participate
thereat;   (v) furnish the other party with copies of all correspondence, 
filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance 
thereof) between them and their affiliates and their respective 
representatives on the one hand, and any government or regulatory  authority
or members or their respective staffs on the other hand,  with respect to
this Agreement and the Merger; and   (vi) furnish the other party with such
necessary information and  reasonable assistance as such other parties and
their respective  affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their
preparation  of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of
information to  any governmental or regulatory authorities, including
without  limitation, any filings necessary or appropriate under the
provisions  of the HSR Act.   (b) Without limiting Section 6.3(a), Parent
and the Company shall:   (i) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid

anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the Company shall not,
without Parent\'s prior written consent, commit to any divestitures,

similar matters), and the Company shall commit to, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to effect (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to commit to and use
reasonable best efforts to effect), any such divestitures, licenses, hold
separate arrangements or similar matters as Parent shall request, but solely
if such divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters
are contingent on consummation of the Merger and (ii) neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required (pursuant to Section 6.3(a)(ii) or
otherwise) to agree (with respect to (x) Parent or its Subsidiaries or (y)
the Company or its Subsidiaries) to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate
arrangements or similar matters, including covenants affecting business
operating practices, if such divestitures, licenses, arrangements or similar
matters, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse
Effect.   Section 6.4 Access to Information. From the date hereof through
Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall allow all designated officers,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives of the other party access at
all reasonable times upon reasonable notice to the records and

otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs of the Company and its
Subsidiaries or Parent and its Subsidiaries, including inspection of such
properties; provided that no  -------- investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.4 shall affect any representation or warranty given by any party
hereunder, and provided further that notwithstanding  -------- ------- the

be deemed to make any representation or warranty except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall
be required to provide any information which it reasonably believes it may
not provide to the other party by reason of applicable law, rules or
regulations, which that party reasonably believes constitutes information
protected by attorney/client privilege, or which it is required to keep
confidential by reason of contract or agreement with third parties. The
parties hereto will make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. The Company and Parent agree that they will not, and will
cause their representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to
this Section 6.4 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   Section 6.5 Notification of
Certain Matters. Each of the Company and Parent agrees to give prompt notice
to the other of, and to use its respective reasonable best efforts to prevent
or promptly remedy, to the extent within their control, (i) the occurrence or
failure to occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to
occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would reasonably be
expected to cause any of its representations or warranties in this Agreement
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at the Effective Time and
(ii) any material failure on its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or   -30-   agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.5 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice.   Section 6.6 Registration Statement; Proxy
Statement.   (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and
promptly prepare and Parent shall file with the SEC as soon as practicable a
Registration Statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act (the
"Registration Statement"), with respect to the Parent Common Shares issuable
in the Merger. A portion of the Registration Statement shall also serve as
the proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus") with respect to the
Shareholders\' Meeting. The respective parties will cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement to comply as to form in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Parent and
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, prior
to the effective date of the Registration Statement, all necessary
state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or approvals required to carry out
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent will advise the
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the
Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or amendment
has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Parent Common Shares issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. The Company will
advise Parent, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by
the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or comments thereon
and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information.  
(b) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly
as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the
SEC.   (c) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that the
information provided by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and each amendment or supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and
at the time of the respective meetings of shareholders of Parent and of the
Company, or, in the case of information provided by it for inclusion in the
Registration Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, at the time it
is filed or becomes effective, (i) will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder and (ii) will not include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.   Section 6.7
Listing Application. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Parent Common Shares to be issued in the Merger and the Parent Common
Shares to be issued upon exercise of Substituted Options and Assumed Options
(as such terms are defined in   -31-   Section 6.10(f)) to be approved
for listing, subject to official notice of issuance, on the New York Stock
Exchange prior to the Effective Time.   Section 6.8 Agreements of
Affiliates. Not less than thirty (30) days before the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Parent a list identifying
all persons who the Company believes may be deemed, at the time of the
Shareholders\' Meeting, to be "affiliates" of the Company, for purposes of
Rule 145 under the Securities Act (the "Rule 145 Affiliates"). Parent shall
be entitled to place restrictive legends on any Parent Common Shares received
by such Rule 145 Affiliates relating to transfer restrictions imposed by Rule
145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each person who is identified as a Rule 145 Affiliate in
such list to deliver to Parent, at or prior to the Effective Time, a written
agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.   Section 6.9
Indemnification and Insurance.   (a) From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law each person who
is, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or
director of the Company (or any Subsidiary or division thereof) and each
person who served at the request of the Company as a director, officer,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (individually, an
"Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including
attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement
in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or
omissions, by them in their capacities as such, whether commenced,
asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time. In the event of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (an "Action"), (i)
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay, as incurred, the fees
and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which counsel
shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent, in advance of the final disposition
of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and, if
required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law, and
(ii) Parent will, and will cause the Surviving Corporation to, cooperate in
the defense of any such matter; provided  -------- that neither Parent nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and provided further that neither Parent nor  -------- ------- the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.9(a)
to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel for all
Indemnified Parties in any single Action, unless, in the good faith judgment
of any of the Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interests
between two or more of such Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be
separate counsel for each similarly situated group.   (b) The parties agree
that the rights to indemnification, including provisions relating to advances
of expenses incurred in defense of any action or suit, in the certificate of
incorporation, bylaws and any indemnification agreement of the Company and
its Subsidiaries with respect to matters occurring through the Effective
Time, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
for a period of six years from the Effective Time; provided  --------  
-32-   that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Action pending
or asserted or claim made within such period shall continue until the
disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim.   (c) For a period
of six years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
maintain officers\' and directors\' liability insurance covering the
Indemnified Parties who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time
were covered by the Company\'s existing officers\' and directors\' liability
insurance ("DandO; Insurance") policies on terms substantially no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance with
respect to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, prior to the
Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other proceedings relating thereto
are commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time);
provided that after the Effective  -------- Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 200% of the last
annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof (the amount of
which premiums are set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter) (the "Maximum
Premium"), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. Parent shall have the right to cause coverage to
be extended under the Company\'s DandO; Insurance by obtaining "tail" coverage
for such six-year period on terms and conditions no less advantageous than
the Company\'s existing DandO; Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy
the provisions of this Section 6.9(c).   (d) The rights of each Indemnified
Party hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified
Party may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, under the OGCA, under existing
indemnification agreements, or otherwise, all of which will be assumed by the
Surviving Corporation and remain in effect for a period of at least six years
following the Effective Time.   (e) In the event Parent or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.9.  
(f) The provisions of this Section 6.9 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the
Indemnified Parties.   Section 6.10 Employee Benefits.   (a) From and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall assume and honor,
all Employee Benefit Plans including all employment agreements with officers
of the Company in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before
the consummation of the Merger, subject to any amendment or termination
thereof that may be permitted by such terms; provided that the 
-------- foregoing shall not be construed as prohibiting Parent or the
Surviving Corporation from terminating the employment of any employee of the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time. It is acknowledged and agreed
that the approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite Vote will constitute
a "change of control" for purposes of all those Employee Benefit Plans
containing "change of control" provisions including existing change of
control agreements between the Company and certain of its officers ("CIC  
-33-   Agreements"). Notwithstanding any provisions in the CIC Agreements
to the contrary, the amounts payable thereunder shall be paid on the Closing
Date.   (b) For 12 months following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall continue to provide to those individuals who are
employed by the Company as of the Effective Time and who remain employed
following the Effective Time by the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary
of the Surviving Corporation ("Affected Employees"), compensation and
employee benefits which, in the aggregate, are no less favorable than the
compensation and benefits provided by the Company to such employees
immediately prior to consummation of the Merger; provided that (i) as of
January 1, 2002, Affected Employees shall become  -------- eligible to
participate in the employee benefit plans, programs, policies
and arrangements of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent (the "Parent Plans")
on the same basis as similarly situated employees of the Parent, and (ii) the
Parent Plans shall be deemed to satisfy this Section 6.10(b). Additionally,
any employee of Company who is not covered by a CIC Agreement whose
employment is terminated by the Surviving Corporation on or after the
Effective Time other than for cause will be eligible for the severance
benefits under the Parent Severance Program effective January 27, 2000 which
provides for, among other things, two months advance notice prior to
termination, severance payments of one month\'s salary for each year of
service or partial year of more than six months with the Company and the
Surviving Corporation (including credited service with the Company as
provided in Section 6.10(c) below), up to six months of paid COBRA coverage,
outplacement services and minimum and maximum severance payment periods of 2
and 18 months, respectively.   (c) The Surviving Corporation shall give
Affected Employees full credit for their continuous service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries (including deemed service credited by such entities) for
purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting (but not benefit accruals
under any defined benefit pension plan) under all employee benefit plans,
programs, policies or arrangements which are maintained by Parent or any
Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation for such Affected Employees
to the same extent recognized by the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time under similar Employee Benefit Plans.   (d) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to the Affected Employees under any welfare
benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees under the Employee Benefit Plans and
that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time and (ii) provide each
Affected Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time (in the calendar year of the Effective Time) in
satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements for the
year in which the Effective Time occurs under any welfare plans that such
employees are eligible to participate in after the Effective Time.   (e)
The Surviving Corporation shall sponsor the Company\'s 401(k) Plan as of the
Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation either shall continue to sponsor
such 401(k) Plan or shall merge such Plan into the 401(k) Plan of Parent with
the result that the participants in the Company\'s 401(k) Plan shall
be entitled to repay any outstanding participant loans pursuant to the terms
of the Company\'s 401(k) Plan and to avoid any deemed distribution.  
-34-    (f) With respect to each outstanding option to acquire Company
Shares (the "Company Options") under the Company\'s Stock Option Plan, (the
"Stock Option Plan") :   (i) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
offer to all  employees and directors of the Company holding Company Options
the  opportunity to elect to amend their Company Options so that they may 
be converted into Substituted Options (as defined below). Prior to  approval
of the Merger by shareholders of the Company, the Company  shall cause the
Committee to exercise its authority under the Stock  Option Plan to make a
determination that optionees will not be  permitted to surrender for
cancellation their outstanding Company  Options for a cash payment following
a Change in Control (as defined  in the Stock Option Plan).   (ii) Parent
shall take all necessary action to provide that, at  the Effective Time, for
each Company employee and director who holds a  Company Option and who elects
to receive a Substituted Option, each  then outstanding Company Option will
automatically be converted into  an option of equivalent value in Parent
Common Shares (the  "Substituted Option") as follows. Each Company Option
will be  converted into a Substituted Option to purchase a number of Parent 
Common Shares equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of  Company
Shares that could have been purchased under such Company  Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (B) the  quotient of (1) the Per
Share Amount (as defined below) divided by (2)  the Average Price (as defined
below) (rounded to the nearest whole  number of Parent Common Shares). The
exercise price per share of the  Substituted Option shall be equal to the
quotient of (C) the per-share  option exercise price specified in the Company
Option divided by (D)  the quotient of (1) the Per Share Amount divided by
(2) the Average  Price (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The "Per Share
Amount"  shall mean the sum of the (E) the Cash Consideration and (F) the 
product of the Exchange Ratio and the Average Price. The Average Price  shall
mean the average (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000) of the volume  weighted
averages (rounded to the nearest 1/10,000) of the trading  prices of Parent
Common Shares on the New York Stock Exchange, as  reported by Bloomberg
Financial markets (or such other source as the  parties shall agree in
writing), for the ten consecutive Trading Days  ending on the third Trading
Day immediately before the Effective Time.  Trading Day shall mean any day on
which securities are traded on the  New York Stock Exchange.   (iii) Parent
shall take all necessary action to provide that, at  the Effective Time, for
each Company employee and director holding a  Company Option who does not
elect to accept a Substituted Option, each  then outstanding Company Option
will automatically be converted into  an option ("Assumed Option") to acquire
the Merger Consideration  (including the cash payment to be made pursuant to
Section 2.2(d) in  lieu of a fraction of a Parent Common Share), and the per
share  exercise price shall be appropriately adjusted, as if such Company 
Option had been exercised immediately prior to the Effective Time.  
-35-    (iv) Except as provided above, the terms and conditions of the 
Substituted Options and the Assumed Options shall be the same as the  terms
of the Company Options and the existing individual agreements  with the
holders thereof.   (g) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the payment of
2001 annual bonuses to employees as provided in Section 5.1(b)(xi), the
Surviving Corporation shall pay such bonuses as set forth on a schedule
delivered by Company to Parent prior to Closing. The aggregate amount of 2001
annual bonuses set forth on such schedule shall not exceed $3.4 million
multiplied by (A) the quotient of the number of days of calendar 2001 elapsed
prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) 365. Bonuses set forth on the
schedule shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation to employees who are
parties to CIC Agreements (as defined in Section 6.10(a) hereof) on the
Closing Date. All other employees listed on the schedule who do not prior
thereto voluntarily terminate employment with the Surviving Corporation or
who are not terminated by the Surviving Corporation for cause shall be paid
their 2001 annual bonuses on or before February 15, 2002.   Section 6.11
Reorganization. From and after the date hereof and until the Effective Time,
none of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall
knowingly (i) take any action, or fail to take any reasonable action, as a
result of which the Merger would fail to qualify as a reorganization within
the meaning of section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) enter into any contract,
agreement, commitment or arrangement to take or fail to take any such action.
Following the Effective Time, Parent shall not knowingly take any action or
knowingly cause any action to be taken which would cause the Merger to fail
to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.   Section 6.12 Public Statements. The parties will consult with each
other and will mutually agree upon any press releases or public
announcements pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such public
announcements prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be
required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange.   Section 6.13 Fees and
Expenses. Except as set forth in Section 8.5, all costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger
is consummated.   Section 6.14 Company Name and Trademarks. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cease
using the Company\'s name and logo in any manner. At the Effective Time, the
Company shall assign its rights to such name to S. A. Louis Dreyfus et Cie or
one or more of its affiliates subject to the terms of a licensing agreement
permitting the Surviving Corporation to use the name and trademark for a
limited transitional period not to exceed one year.   -36-    ARTICLE

of a termination pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.2 or clause (iv) of
Section 8.4, such termination results from the breach by the Company in a

this Agreement and at the time of such breach, any person shall have made a
Company Acquisition Proposal that had become public and then remained pending
or shall   -40-   have publicly announced and not withdrawn an intention
(whether or not conditional) to make a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (2)

pay Parent $70 million (the "Termination Amount") upon termination of this

referred to in clause (E) thereof is consummated. The Company acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5(a) are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and constitute liquidated
damages and not a penalty, and that, without these agreements, Parent would
not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to
pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5(a), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment
against the Company for the payment set forth in this Section 8.5(a), the
Company shall pay to Parent its costs and expenses (including attorneys\'
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount

of the Parent/Company Confidentiality Agreement and except for the provisions
of Article IX, provided that nothing herein shall relieve any party from
any  -------- liability for any breach by such party of any of its covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement and all rights and remedies of such
non-breaching party under this Agreement in the case of such a breach, at law
or in equity, shall be preserved.   Section 8.6 Extension; Waiver. At any
time prior to the Effective Time, each party may by action taken by its board
