not violate, conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of the

the Purchaser or Acquireco of their obligations in connection with the
Arrangement under this Agreement or for the completion of the Arrangement,

    | (e)  |  

_Available Funds_. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions to the
Arrangement as set out in this Agreement, the Purchaser and Acquireco will
have at the Effective Time sufficient funds available to consummate the
Arrangement  and pay the aggregate Consideration and other amounts required
to be paid pursuant hereto on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein and in the Plan of Arrangement, and to satisfy all other
obligations payable at the  Effective Time by the Purchaser and Acquireco
pursuant to this Agreement and the Arrangement.

_Financing_.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

The Purchaser has delivered to eOne true, correct and complete copies of an
executed commitment letter and corresponding fee letter (with only the fee
amounts, pricing flex, interest rates (and pricing caps) and other economic
terms  of the market flex (none of which would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing) redacted)
dated on or about the date hereof (such letters collectively, the "Debt
Commitment Letter") from the financial institutions identified therein
(together with any other agent, arranger, lender or other entity that commits
to provide or arrange, or enters into definitive agreements  related to, the
Debt Financing, the "Financing Sources") to provide, subject to the terms and
conditions therein, debt financing to the Purchaser in the amounts set forth
therein for the purpose  of funding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (being collectively referred to as the "Debt Financing").

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (ii)  |  

As of the date hereof, the Debt Commitment Letter has not been amended or
modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated (other than the
entering into of customary joinders to add Financing Sources), and none of
the  respective obligations and commitments contained in such letters have
been withdrawn, terminated, rescinded, amended or modified in any respect. The
Purchaser has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees in
connection with  the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or prior to
the date hereof. Assuming the Debt Financing is funded in accordance with the
Debt Commitment Letter, the net proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter, together with  the Purchaser's cash on hand, will in the aggregate be
sufficient for the Purchaser and Acquireco to, on and after the Effective
Date, (a) pay the aggregate Consideration, (b) pay for any refinancing of any
outstanding indebtedness of  eOne and the Purchaser contemplated by the Debt

Commitment Letter, and (c) pay any and all other amounts required to be paid
by the Purchaser or Acquireco hereunder for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including fees and expenses
required to  be paid by the Purchaser and Acquireco in connection with the
Arrangement, the other transactions contemplated hereby, the Debt Financing
(including any additional fees that may be required in connection with the
exercise of any  "flex" provisions in the related fee letter), and the
refinancing referred to in (b) above (such payments, the "Required Payments").

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

 

       
    | (iii)  |  

The Debt Commitment Letter is in full force and effect as of the date hereof
and constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser and, to the
knowledge of the Purchaser, each other party thereto, enforceable against
such  party in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency
and other applicable Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and subject to general principles of equity. No event has occurred
which, with or  without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to (A) constitute a default or breach on the part of
the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, any
other party thereto, under  any term of the Debt Financing, (B) to the
knowledge of the Purchaser, constitute a failure of any condition to the Debt
Financing or (C) to the knowledge of the Purchaser otherwise result in any
portion of the Debt Financing being  unavailable on the Effective Date.
Neither the Purchaser nor Acquireco has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the proceeds of
the Debt Financing will not be available to  Acquireco in the full
contemplated amount at the time required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (iv)  |

parties under the Debt Commitment Letter (including pursuant to any "flex"
provisions in the related fee letter or otherwise) to make the full amount of
the  Debt Financing available to the Purchaser on the terms therein except as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of the date hereof,
there are no side letters or other contracts to which the Purchaser, Acquireco
or any of  their respective affiliates is a party, which expand the
conditions precedent to the Debt Financing.

    | (g)  |  

_Litigation_. There is no claim, action, inquiry, suit, hearing, arbitration,
investigation or other proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser, threatened against or relating to the Purchaser or Acquireco or 
affecting any of their respective properties or assets before any Governmental
Entity, nor is the Purchaser or Acquireco subject to any outstanding order,
writ, injunction or decree that, individually or in the aggregate, is
reasonably  likely to prevent or materially delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

and

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (vi)  |  

is not considered in determining whether a representation, warranty or
covenant of eOne hereunder has been breached, it being acknowledged by the
Purchaser and eOne that these actions could require the consent of third

---|---|---

Subsidiaries and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
advisors and Representative shall have received an  indemnity, in form and
substance satisfactory to eOne, acting reasonably, from the Purchaser from and
against all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,

    | (a)  |  

The Purchaser and Acquireco shall use, and cause their respective affiliates
to use, their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or  advisable to arrange and obtain the Debt Financing described in
the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions (including the flex
provisions) described therein and in the related fee letter including using
reasonable best  efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter
in accordance with its terms until the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (or until the earlier termination of the
commitments thereunder, in  accordance with the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letters, unless the Purchaser shall have arranged and obtained in replacement
thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient
to consummate the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (including the
Arrangement), with conditions precedent to funding not less favorable to the
Purchaser (in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser) than the terms set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter  (including the flex provisions thereof)),
including to the extent any asset sales or debt incurrences are consummated
which would reduce the commitments under the Debt Commitment Letter, by
ensuring that the proceeds of such  transactions are available in place of
such reduced commitments to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Arrangement, (ii) to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the  financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (collectively, the "Debt Financing Agreements") on the terms
and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the Debt
Commitment  Letter and related fee letter or, if available, on other terms
that are acceptable to the Purchaser and would not adversely affect the
ability of the Purchaser and Acquireco to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement,  (iii) to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions to funding that are applicable to the Purchaser, Acquireco and
their respective affiliates in the Debt Commitment Letter (including, without
limitation, to ensure that no event of  default (an "Existing Credit
Agreement Event of Default") described in paragraph (g)(i) of Exhibit B to the
Debt Commitment Letter exists) and such definitive agreements thereto and to
consummate  the Debt Financing at or prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) to
enforce its rights under or with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (b)  |  

None of the Purchaser, Acquireco or any of their respective affiliates shall
agree to any amendments or modifications to, or grant any waivers of, any
condition or other provision under the Debt Commitment Letter without the
prior  written consent of eOne to the extent such amendments, modifications
or waivers would reasonably be expected to (A) reduce the aggregate amount of
cash proceeds available from the Debt Financing to fund the amounts required
to be paid  by the Purchaser and Acquireco pursuant to this Agreement below
the amount required, together with the Purchaser's cash on hand, to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Arrangement
(including by  changing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue
discount) (B) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend
or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a
manner reasonably likely to  prevent or delay or impair the ability of

each of the Purchaser or Acquireco to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (C) amend or modify any other term in a manner
reasonably likely to prevent or delay or impair the ability of each of the 
Purchaser or Acquireco to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Arrangement, or adversely impact the ability of the
Purchaser or Acquireco to enforce their rights against the other parties to
the  Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing Agreements. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser shall give eOne prompt
(and in any event within two business days) written notice (x) of any actual
or alleged  breach or default (or any event that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach
or default) by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt
Financing Agreements or  any Existing Credit Agreement Event of Default, (y)
of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication with
respect to any actual or alleged breach, default, termination or repudiation
by any party to any of the Debt  Commitment Letter or any definitive document
related to the Debt Financing or any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter
or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing or of any Existing
Credit Agreement Event of Default  or (z) if the Purchaser or Acquireco
determine in good faith that they will not be able to satisfy any of the
obligations to, or otherwise be able to obtain, some or any portion of the
Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or  from the sources contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" provisions) or Debt
Financing Agreements prior to the Outside Date. Upon the occurrence of any
circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z)  of the preceding sentence
or if any portion of the Debt Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, and
such portion is reasonably required to fund the aggregate Consideration and
all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be  paid by the
Purchaser or Acquireco pursuant to this Agreement, the Purchaser and Acquireco
shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement
thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an  amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Arrangement), with conditions precedent to funding not less
favorable to the Purchaser (in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser) than
the  terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the flex
provisions thereof). Additionally, the Debt Commitment Letter contemplates
that the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries may obtain alternative financing which
would reduce  the commitments of the Debt Financing Sources under the Debt
Commitment Letter. Any reference in this Agreement to (1) the Debt Financing
shall include any such alternative financing, (2) the Debt Commitment Letter
shall include the  commitment letter and the corresponding fee letter with
respect to any such alternative financing, (3) the Debt Financing Agreements
shall include the definitive agreements with respect to any such alternative
financing and (4) the  Financing Sources shall include the financing
institutions contemplated to provide any such alternative financing.

Financing  reasonably requested by eOne, and shall provide to eOne, as soon
as reasonably practicable but in any event within three calendar days of the
date eOne delivers to Purchaser a written

Acquisition Proposal pursuant to an existing  standstill or other
restriction; and (iv) eOne has been and continues to be in compliance with its
obligations under this Section 7.1 (it being understood that eOne shall not be

participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding such
Acquisition Proposal and, subject to the execution of an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, provide such Person with access to information 
regarding eOne and its Subsidiaries; provided that (A) eOne sends a copy of
any such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement to the Purchaser promptly upon
its execution, and (B) thereafter the Purchaser is provided with access to any
information to which such Person was provided and which was not previously
provided to the Purchaser.

after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
such Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal (if 
applicable, compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the this
Agreement and the Arrangement by the Purchaser under Section 7.1(f)) and (B)
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel,  that the failure by the Board to make a Change in Recommendation or
to cause eOne to terminate this Agreement to enter into the Proposed
Agreement, as applicable, would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (vi)  |  

in the case of eOne exercising its rights under clause (2) of this Section
7.1(e), (A) eOne concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.2(a)(iv)(B), and (B) prior to entering into the Proposed Agreement, eOne
has  paid to the Purchaser the Termination Payment.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (f)  |  

eOne acknowledges and agrees that, during the Matching Period or such longer
period as eOne may approve for such purpose, the Purchaser shall have the
opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of this 
Agreement, the Arrangement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and eOne shall co-operate with the Purchaser with respect thereto, including
negotiating in good faith with the Purchaser to enable the Purchaser to make
such  adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Arrangement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as the
Purchaser deems appropriate and as would enable the Purchaser to proceed with
the Arrangement or the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement or other
similar transactions involving eOne and its Subsidiaries and any related
transactions on such adjusted terms. The Board will review any proposal by the
Purchaser to amend the terms of  this Agreement or the Arrangement and any
other information provided by Purchaser in connection with any such proposal
in order to determine, in good faith in the exercise of its fiduciary duties
and consistent with Section 7.1(e),  whether the Purchaser's proposal to
amend this Agreement, the Arrangement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement would, if accepted by eOne, result in the Acquisition Proposal no
longer being a Superior Proposal compared to  the proposed amendment to the
terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement.

    | (g)  |  

The Board shall promptly (and in any event within two business days) reaffirm
its recommendation of the Arrangement by press release after: (i) any
Acquisition Proposal which is not determined to be a Superior Proposal is
publicly  announced; or (ii) the Board determines that a proposed amendment
to the terms of the Arrangement would result in an Acquisition Proposal which
has been publicly announced no longer being a Superior Proposal, and eOne and
the Purchaser  have so amended the terms of the Arrangement. The Purchaser
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the form and content of

-72-  

 

 

       
    | 
    |  

any such press release, recognizing that whether or not such comments are
appropriate will be determined by eOne, acting reasonably.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

  
 

 

 

       
    | (h)  |  

Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Board from: (i) responding through
a directors' circular or equivalent document as required by applicable
Securities Laws to an Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) making any disclosure to
the  securityholders of eOne if the Board, acting in good faith and after
consultation with its outside legal advisors, shall have first determined that
the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of  the Board, provided, however, in each case that, notwithstanding
that the Board shall be permitted to make such disclosure, the Board shall not
be permitted to make a Change in Recommendation,  other than as permitted by
Section 7.1(e).

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

eOne acknowledges and agrees that each successive modification of any
Acquisition Proposal that results in any amendment or modification of the
financial terms or conditions or other material terms and conditions,
including any  modification of, the consideration (or value of such
consideration) to be received by Shareholders shall constitute a new
Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of this Section 7.1.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (j)  |  

eOne shall ensure that the officers, directors and employees of eOne and its
Subsidiaries and any investment bankers, advisors or other Representatives
retained by eOne and/or its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement are aware of the provisions of this Section,
and eOne shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 7.1 by such
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, advisors or other
Representatives.

    | (k)  |  

If eOne provides the Purchaser with a Superior Proposal Notice on a date that
is less than 10 business days prior to the Meeting, eOne shall be permitted
to, and shall if requested by the Purchaser, adjourn or postpone the Meeting
to  a date that is not less than seven business days and not more than 10
business days after the date of such notice, provided, however, that the
Meeting shall not be adjourned or postponed to a date later than the seventh
business day  prior to the Outside Date.

with applicable Law and the terms of any existing Contracts, eOne shall,  and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to afford to
the Purchaser and to representatives of the Purchaser such access as the
Purchaser may reasonably require at all reasonable times, including for the
purpose of  facilitating integration business planning, to their officers,
employees, agents, properties, books, records and contracts, and shall furnish
the Purchaser with all data and information as the Purchaser may reasonably
request. The Purchaser and  eOne acknowledge and agree that information

conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement.

    | (a)  |  

Each Party will give prompt notice to the other of the occurrence, or failure
to occur, at any time from the date hereof until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms and the Effective Time
of  any event or state of facts which occurrence or failure would, or would
be likely to:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (i)  |  

cause any of the representations or warranties of such Party contained herein
to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect on the date hereof or at
the Effective Time (provided that this clause (i) shall not apply in the
case  of any event or state of facts resulting from the actions or omissions
of a Party which are required under this Agreement); or

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (ii)  |  

result in the failure to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such Party hereunder prior to
the Effective Time,

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
7.3 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
the Party receiving that notice.

 


 

 

 

       
    | (b)  |  

No Party may elect not to complete the transactions contemplated hereby
pursuant to the conditions set forth herein or any termination right arising
therefrom under Section 8.2(a)(iii)(B) or Section 8.2(a)(iv)(A) unless, prior
to the  Effective Date, the Party intending to rely thereon has delivered a
written notice to the other Party specifying in reasonable detail all breaches
of covenants, representations and warranties or other matters which the Party
delivering  such notice is asserting as the basis for the non-fulfilment or
the applicable condition or termination right, as the case may be. If any such
notice is delivered, provided that a Party is proceeding diligently to cure
such matter and  such matter is capable of being cured, no Party may
terminate this Arrangement Agreement until the expiration of a period of 10
business days from such notice.

arising from facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Effective Date
and the Purchaser will,  or will cause eOne and its Subsidiaries to, maintain

six years from the Effective Date; provided, that the Purchaser shall not be
required to pay any amounts in  respect of such coverage prior to the
Effective Time and provided, further that the cost of such policy shall not
exceed 300% of eOne's current annual aggregate premium for policies
currently  maintained by eOne or its Subsidiaries.

-74-  

 

       
    | (b)  |  

The Purchaser agrees that it shall cause eOne and its Subsidiaries to honour
all rights to indemnification or exculpation now existing in favour of present

such rights shall survive the completion of the Plan of Arrangement and shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years from
the Effective Date.

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

 

       
    | (c)  |  

The provisions of this Section 7.4 are intended for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified Person, his or her heirs and
his or her legal representatives and, for such purpose, eOne hereby confirms

a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to perform any covenant
or agreement on the part of eOne set forth in this Agreement shall have
occurred that would cause the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
Section  6.2(b) not to be satisfied, and such breach or failure is incapable
of being cured by the Outside Date or is not cured in accordance with Section

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement (which intentional and material breach and liability therefor shall

    | (d)  |  

Each of the Parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
and that, without those agreements, the Parties would not enter into this 
Agreement. Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in
this Section 8.3 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages, which the Party entitled to such damages will suffer
or  incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and the
resultant termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. Each of the
Parties irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that
any such  liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater
certainty, each Party agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where the Purchaser is entitled to a Termination Payment
and such Termination  Payment is paid in full, the Purchaser and Acquireco
shall be precluded from any other remedy against eOne at Law or in equity or
otherwise (including, without limitation, an order for specific performance),
and shall not seek to obtain  any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind,
including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against eOne or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
partners, managers, members,  shareholders or affiliates or their respective
representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided, however, that payment by eOne of a
Termination  Payment shall not be in lieu of any damages or any other payment
or remedy available in the event of any wilful or intentional breach by eOne
of any of its obligations under this Agreement.

This Agreement shall be governed, including as to validity, interpretation and
effect, by the Laws of the Province of Ontario and the Laws of Canada
applicable therein, except that any claim, action, proceeding or 
investigation against any Designated Financing Sources (in its or their
capacity as such) that is related to this Agreement or the Arrangement shall
be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the law of
the State of New York  without regard to the conflict of law principles
thereof. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns and submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario in respect of
all matters arising under and in relation to  this Agreement and the
Arrangement; provided that the Parties, with respect to any claim, action,
proceeding or investigation against any Designated Financing Source that is
related to this Agreement or the Arrangement irrevocably submit  exclusively
to the jurisdiction of the courts of any federal court sitting in the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York (or, only if such court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, in any New York State court sitting in the Borough of 
Manhattan in the City of New York). EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT.

 


 

 

 

       9.4  |  

Injunctive Relief

    
---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

The Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur for which money damages
would not be an adequate remedy at Law in the event that any of the provisions
of this Agreement were not performed in  accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, in the event
of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by a Party, the non-
breaching Party will be entitled, without the requirement of  posting a bond
or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and
specific performance, and the Parties shall not object to the granting of
injunctive or other equitable relief on the basis that there exists an
adequate remedy  at Law. Such remedies will not be the exclusive remedies for
any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all other remedies
available at Law or equity to each of the Parties.

This Agreement, the Disclosure Letter, and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between  the Parties, or any of them,
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof. Except as expressly
provided herein (including in the proviso to this sentence), this Agreement is
not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other than  the Parties
any rights or remedies hereunder; provided, that the provisions of Section
8.2, Section 8.4, Section 9.3 and this Section 9.6 that are applicable to any
Designated Financing Source are intended to benefit and be enforceable by
such  Designated Financing Source. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned the Parties without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, provided that the rights,
interests or obligations of  Aquireco (or any permitted assignee thereof) may
be assigned to a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Purchaser if such assignee
delivers an instrument in writing confirming that it is bound by and shall
perform all of the obligations of the assigning  party under this Agreement
as if it were an original signatory.

 


 

 

 

       9.7  |  

No Liability

    
---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

No director or officer of the Purchaser or Acquireco shall have any personal
liability whatsoever to eOne under this Agreement, or any other document
delivered in connection with the transactions  contemplated hereby on behalf
of the Purchaser or Acquireco. No director or officer of eOne shall have any
personal liability whatsoever to the Purchaser or Acquireco under this
Agreement, or any other document delivered in connection with the 
transactions contemplated hereby on behalf of the Purchaser or Acquireco.

 


 

 

 

       9.8  |  

Severability

    
---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall  nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision  is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner
to the end that the  transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
fullest extent possible.

 


 

 

 

       9.9  |  

Counterparts, Execution

    
---|--- 
    

 

 


 

 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. The Parties shall  be entitled to rely upon
delivery of an executed facsimile or similar executed electronic copy of this
Agreement, and such facsimile or similar executed electronic copy shall be
legally effective to create a valid and binding agreement between the 
Parties.

affiliate, as the case may be), shall be transferred by the holder thereof to
Acquireco (without further action and free and clear of all Liens) in exchange
for the  Consideration (less applicable withholdings) for each Common Share

which such holder is entitled to purchase or receive, or, if an eOne Capital

Consideration, and immediately such UK SAYE Option and any agreements related
thereto  shall be terminated and be of no further force and effect and eOne
shall have no liabilities or obligations with respect to any such UK SAYE
Option or any such agreement except as expressly set out in this Section
3.1(h)(ii); and

Rights of Dissent

         |  

(a)

    |  

Pursuant to the Interim Order, registered holders of Common Shares may
exercise rights of dissent ("Dissent Rights") under Section 190 of the CBCA,
as modified by this Article 4, the Interim Order and the Final Order, with
respect to Common Shares in connection with the Arrangement, provided that 
the written notice setting forth the objection of such registered holders of
Common Shares to the Arrangement and exercise of Dissent Rights must be
received by eOne not later than 5:00 p.m. on the business day that is two
business days  before the Meeting or any date to which the Meeting may be
postponed or adjourned and provided further that holders who exercise such
Dissent Rights and who:

    
---|---|--- 
    

 

\- 9 -  


 

 


 

         |   |  

(i)

    |  

are ultimately entitled to be paid fair value for their Common Shares, which
fair value, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Part XV of 
the CBCA, shall be determined as of the close of business on the day before
the Arrangement Resolution was adopted, shall have transferred their Common
Shares to Acquireco at the time specified in Section 3.1(e) and shall be paid
such  fair value by Acquireco in accordance with Section 3.1(e); and

    
---|---|---|--- 
      |   |   |   
      |   |  

(ii)

    |  

are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair value for their
Common Shares shall be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement at the 
same time as and on the same basis as a non-dissenting holder of Common Shares
and shall be entitled to receive only the consideration contemplated in
Section 3.1(f) that such holder would have received pursuant to the
Arrangement if  such holder had not exercised Dissent Rights.

    
    


 

         |  

(b)

    |  

In no circumstances shall Acquireco, eOne, the Purchaser or any other Person
be required to recognize a Person exercising Dissent Rights unless such
Person  is a registered holder of those Common Shares in respect of which
such rights are sought to be exercised.

    
---|---|--- 
      |   |   
      |  

(c)

    |  

For greater certainty, in no case shall Acquireco, eOne, the Purchaser or any
other Person be required to recognize Dissenting Shareholders as holders of 
Common Shares after the Effective Time, and the names of such Dissenting
Shareholders shall be deleted from the register of Shareholders as of the
Effective Time. In addition to any other restrictions under Section 190 of the
CBCA and,  for greater certainty, none of the following shall be entitled to
exercise Dissent Rights: (i) holders of International SAYE Options, UK SAYE
Options, Stock Options and Conditional Awards; and (ii) Shareholders who vote,
or who have  instructed a proxyholder to vote, in favour of the Arrangement
Resolution.

Exchange of Certificates for Cash

    
---|--- 
    


 

         |  

(a)

    |  

Following receipt of the Final Order, and immediately prior to the filing by
eOne of the Articles of Arrangement, the Purchaser or Acquireco shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to the Depositary sufficient funds to satisfy (i) on
behalf of Acquireco, the aggregate Consideration payable to  Shareholders
pursuant to Section 3.1(f), and (ii) the amounts required to be paid pursuant
to Section 3.1(a), which amounts shall be held by the Depositary in escrow as
agent and nominee for such former Shareholders or former Award  Holders, as
the case may be, for distribution in accordance with the provisions of this
Article 5.

    
---|---|--- 
      |   |   
      |  

(b)

    |  

Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Common Shares
that  were exchanged for cash, together with a duly completed and executed
Letter of Transmittal and such additional documents and instruments as the
Depositary

    
    

 

\- 10 -  


 

 


 

         |   |  

may reasonably require, the Shareholder of such surrendered certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Purchaser and Acquireco 
shall cause the Depositary to deliver to such Shareholder, on behalf of
Acquireco, a cheque (or other form of immediately available funds)
representing the cash which such Shareholder has the right to receive under
the Arrangement for  such Common Shares, less any amounts withheld pursuant
to Section 5.3 and any certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. The cash deposited with the Depositary shall be held in an
interest-bearing account, and any interest  earned on such funds shall be for
the account of Acquireco.

    
---|---|--- 
      |   |   
      |  

(c)

    |  

Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 5.1, each certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Common Shares shall be 
deemed after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender a cash payment in lieu of such certificate as contemplated in
this Section 5.1, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.3. Any
such  certificate formerly representing Common Shares not duly surrendered on
or before the second anniversary of the Effective Date shall cease to
represent a claim by or interest of any Former Shareholder of any kind or
nature against or in  eOne, Acquireco or the Purchaser. On the second
anniversary of the Effective Date, all cash to which such Former Shareholder
was entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered to Acquireco.

    
      |   |   
      |  

(d)

    |  

On the Effective Date, the Purchaser and Acquireco will direct the Depositary
to transfer to eOne the aggregate amount payable to Award Holders in 
accordance with Section 3.1 (such amount to be held in escrow by eOne as agent
and nominee for such holders until payments pursuant to Section 3.1 and this
Section 5.1(d) are made to such Award Holders). On the Effective Date, eOne 
shall pay or cause to be paid out of such escrowed amount the amounts, net of
applicable withholdings, to be paid to Award Holders on behalf of eOne
pursuant to Section 3.1, either (i) pursuant to the normal payroll practices
and  procedures of eOne, or (ii) by cheque or similar means (delivered to
such Award Holder, as reflected on the register maintained by or on behalf of
eOne in respect of the International SAYE Options, Elected UK SAYE Options,
Stock Options  or Conditional Awards).

    
      |   |   
      |  

(e)

    |  

From and after the Effective Time until the UK SAYE Option Expiry Time, upon
the exercise of any UK SAYE Option (other than Elected UK SAYE Options), the 
UK SAYE Option Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid, net of applicable
withholdings, the amounts to be paid to such holder pursuant to 3.1(h)(ii),
either (i) pursuant to the normal payroll practices and procedures of eOne, or
(ii) by  cheque or similar means (delivered to such holder, as reflected on
the register maintained by or on behalf of eOne in respect of the UK SAYE
Options).

    
      |   |   
      |  

(f)

    |  

Any payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary on behalf of Acquireco,
eOne or the UK SAYE Option Purchaser that has not been deposited or has been 
returned to the Depositary or that otherwise remains unclaimed, in each case,
on or before the second anniversary of the Effective Date, and any right or
claim to payment hereunder that remains outstanding on the second anniversary
of  the Effective Date shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind
or nature and the right of the holder to receive the consideration for Common
Shares, Stock Options,

    
    


 

 

 

\- 11 -  


 

 


 

         |   |

this Plan of Arrangement shall terminate and be deemed to be surrendered and 
forfeited to Acquireco, eOne or the UK SAYE Option Purchaser, as applicable,
for no consideration.

Lost Certificates

    
---|--- 
    


 

 

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Common Shares that were exchanged pursuant
to  Section 3.1 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or  destroyed certificate, cash deliverable in accordance with such
holder's Letter of Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in exchange for
any lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Person to whom such cash is to
be delivered shall as a  condition precedent to the delivery of such cash,
give a bond satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Depositary in such sum as
the Purchaser may direct, or otherwise indemnify the Purchaser, Acquireco and
eOne in a manner satisfactory to the  Purchaser, Acquireco and eOne, against
any claim that may be made against the Purchaser, Acquireco and eOne with
respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 


 

        

5.3

Withholding Rights

    
---|--- 
    


 

 

eOne, Acquireco, the Purchaser and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any Shareholder or
holder of  International SAYE Options, UK SAYE Options, Stock Options or
Conditional Awards such amounts as eOne, Acquireco, the Purchaser or the
Depositary determines, acting reasonably, are required or permitted to be
deducted and withheld with respect  to such payment under the Tax Act or any
provision of federal, provincial, territorial, state, local or foreign tax
law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all  purposes hereof as having
been paid to the Shareholder or holder of Conditional Awards, Stock Options,
International SAYE Options or UK SAYE Options in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld  amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.

From and after the Effective Time: (a) this Plan of Arrangement shall take

International SAYE Options, UK SAYE Options and Stock Options issued or
outstanding prior to the Effective Time, (b) the rights and obligations of the
Shareholders, the Award Holders, holders of UK SAYE Options, eOne, the
Purchaser, Acquireco,  the Depositary and any transfer agent or other

proceedings (actual or contingent and whether  or not previously asserted)
based on or in any way relating to any Common Shares, Conditional Awards,
International SAYE Options, UK SAYE Options or Stock Options shall be deemed
to have been settled, compromised, released and determined  without liability
except as set forth in this Plan of Arrangement.
