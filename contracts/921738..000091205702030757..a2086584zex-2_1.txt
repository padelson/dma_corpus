corporation ("PARENT"), and P ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a
direct wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB").

                     WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and
Merger Sub each have, in light of and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, resolved to deem this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Merger, taken together, advisable and fair to, and in the
best interests of, their respective stockholders; and

                     WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, Parent and certain stockholders of the Company are executing and
delivering one or more Stockholder Agreements, dated as of the date hereof, in a
form agreed to by such parties (the "STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS") pursuant to which
such stockholders are, among other things, covenanting to vote in favor of the
adoption of and otherwise to support this Agreement.

                     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                     SECTION 1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time and upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company (the "Merger"). Following the Merger, the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.

                     SECTION 1.2 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing an appropriate Certificate of Merger or other appropriate
documents (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in such form as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL, as soon as practicable on or after the Closing
Date. The Merger shall become effective upon such filing or at such time
thereafter as is provided in the Certificate of Merger (the "EFFECTIVE TIME").

                     SECTION 1.3 Closing of the Merger. The closing of the
Merger (the "CLOSING") will take place at a time and on a date to be specified
by the parties (the "CLOSING DATE"), which shall be no later than the second
business day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article
VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), at the


<PAGE>
offices of Morgan, Lewis & Bockius LLP, 1701 Market Street, Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania 19103, or at such other time, date or place as agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto.

                     SECTION 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

                     SECTION 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The
certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall
be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, except that
Article I of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
read "The name of the corporation is "Hollywood Casino Corporation"" until
amended in accordance with applicable Law. The bylaws of the Merger Sub in
effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until amended in accordance with applicable Law.

                     SECTION 1.6 Directors. The directors of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, to
hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.

                     SECTION 1.7 Officers. The officers of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, to
hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation until their successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.


                                   ARTICLE II

                              CONVERSION OF SHARES

                     SECTION 2.1 Conversion of Shares. (a) At the Effective
Time, each outstanding share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, be converted into one fully paid and
non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

                     (b) At the Effective Time, each share of Class A common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company including the associated
Rights ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (individually, a "SHARE" and collectively, the "SHARES") (other
than (i) Shares held by the Company, (ii) Shares held by Parent, Merger Sub or
any other subsidiary of Parent and (iii) any Dissenting Shares) shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
any holder thereof, be converted into and be exchangeable for the right to
receive $12.75, without interest, in cash (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). At the
Effective Time, the Shares will no longer be outstanding and will automatically


                                        2
<PAGE>
be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate representing such Share immediately prior to the Effective Time will
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon surrender of such certificate in accordance with
Section 2.4.

                     (c) At the Effective Time, each Share held by Parent,
Merger Sub, any other subsidiary of Parent, or the Company immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Merger Sub, the Company or any holder thereof, be canceled, retired and
cease to exist and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

                     (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock (the "DISSENTING SHARES") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder
who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant
to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL ("SECTION 262") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1(b), but instead such holder shall be
entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the
provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction
shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by
Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such
holder's Dissenting Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Dissenting
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and
shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.1(b). The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands to assert dissenters' rights that are received by the Company with
respect to Shares and (ii) the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any such demands. The Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to or
settle any such demands.

                     SECTION 2.2 Stock Options. As soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company (or, if appropriate, any
committee of the Company Board administering the Company's 1996 Non-Employee
Director Stock Plan or 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the "COMPANY
OPTION PLANS")) shall take such action as may be required to effect the
following provisions of this Section 2.2. As of the Effective Time each option
to purchase Shares pursuant to the Company Option Plans (each a "COMPANY STOCK
OPTION") which is then outstanding and has not been exercised shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or
any holder thereof, be converted into and exchangeable for the right to receive
an amount equal to the Merger Consideration in cash, less an amount equal to (a)
the exercise price for such Company Stock Option plus (b) any applicable tax
withholding amounts. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any Company Stock
Option with respect to which the applicable exercise price is greater than or
equal to the Merger Consideration shall be fully exercisable prior to the
Effective Time in accordance with the terms of the Company Option Plans, and any
such Company Stock Option that is not exercised prior to the Effective Time


                                        3
<PAGE>
shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall pay
the cash consideration to be paid for the Company Stock Options, via check, as
promptly as practicable but, in any event, within ten (10) business days after
the Effective Time.

                     SECTION 2.3 Exchange Fund. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging
Shares for the Merger Consideration (the "EXCHANGE AGENT"). At or prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the
benefit of holders of Shares, the cash payable pursuant to Section 2.1(b) in
exchange for outstanding Shares. The cash deposited with the Exchange Agent
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "EXCHANGE FUND."

                     SECTION 2.4 Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares (the
"CERTIFICATES") (a) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery
shall be effective, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter
shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify; and (b) instructions for effecting the surrender of such
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check in
the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant
to the provisions of this Article II. No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any cash payable upon the surrender of the Certificates. If payment is made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it will be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered will be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall (i) pay any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to
a person other than the registered holder of the surrendered Certificate or (ii)
establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

                     SECTION 2.5 No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common
Stock. All cash paid upon conversion of the Shares in accordance with the terms
of Article I and this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares.

                     SECTION 2.6 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of
the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving Corporation, and
any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this
Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation and Parent
for the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented
thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(b) and
Section 2.4. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by
holders of Shares five (5) years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date


                                        4
<PAGE>
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become subject to the abandoned property Law of any Governmental Entity) shall,
to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

                     SECTION 2.7 No Liability. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
person in respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

                     SECTION 2.8 Investment of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent
on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall promptly be paid to Parent.

                     SECTION 2.9 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in the form
reasonably required by the Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented
thereby.

                     SECTION 2.10 Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of a Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect to which
such deduction and withholding were made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be.

                     SECTION 2.11 Stock Transfer Books. The stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the
records of the Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall be converted into
the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented
thereby.

                                   ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

                     Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by
the Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "COMPANY
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly
numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified


                                        5
<PAGE>
therein), the Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and
Merger Sub as follows:

                     SECTION 3.1 Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries.
(a) The Company and each of its subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite corporate, partnership
or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to
carry on its business as now conducted and proposed by the Company to be
conducted. For purposes of this Section 3.1, the concept of good standing
applies to any of the Foreign Subs only to the extent that such concept is
recognized and exists under the Laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization of such Foreign Sub.

                     (b) Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a list of all subsidiaries of the Company. Except as listed in Section 3.1
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, beneficially or of record, any shares of capital stock or other
security of any other entity or any other investment in any other entity.

                     (c) Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction
in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing does
not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. None of the Company's
subsidiaries located in Argentina or Mexico (collectively, the "FOREIGN SUBS"),
has any assets valued, individually or in the aggregate, at more than $25,000,
and none of the Foreign Subs has conducted any business to date.

                     (d) The Company has heretofore made available or delivered
to Parent accurate and complete copies of the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other similar governing instruments), as currently in effect, of the
Company and each of its subsidiaries.

                     SECTION 3.2 Capitalization of the Company and Its
Subsidiaries. (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of: (i)
50,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, of which 25,477,625 shares were
issued and outstanding and 117,831 shares of which are held in the Company's
treasury, each as of the close of business on June 30, 2002; (ii) 10,000,000
shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "CLASS B
SHARES"), of which no Class B Shares are issued and outstanding; (iii) 15,000
shares of Class A cumulative preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"CLASS A PREFERRED SHARES"), of which no Class A Preferred Shares are issued and
outstanding; (iv) 15,000,000 shares of Series preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share (the "SERIES PREFERRED SHARES"), of which no Series Preferred Shares
are issued and outstanding; and (v) 1,000,000 shares of Series A junior
participating preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "SERIES A JUNIOR
PREFERRED SHARES"), of which no Series A Junior Preferred Shares are issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding Shares have been validly issued,
and are duly authorized, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive
rights. As of June 30, 2002, 2,180,040 shares of Company Common Stock were
reserved for issuance and issuable upon or otherwise deliverable in connection
with the exercise of outstanding Company Stock Options issued pursuant to the


                                        6
<PAGE>
Company Option Plans. Since March 31, 2002, (a) no shares of the Company's
capital stock have been issued other than pursuant to Company Stock Options
already in existence on such date, (b) no Company Stock Options have been
granted and (c) other than in connection with the cashless exercise of any
Company Stock Options, there has been no declaration or payment of any dividend
or other distribution and no repurchase of shares of capital stock of the
Company. Except as set forth above, as of the date hereof, there are outstanding
(i) no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company; (ii)
no securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company;
(iii) except for the Company Rights Agreement, no options or other rights to
acquire from the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and no obligations of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries to issue, any capital stock, voting
securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or
voting securities of the Company; and (iv) no equity equivalents, interests in
the ownership or earnings of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or other
similar rights (including stock appreciation rights) (collectively, "COMPANY
SECURITIES"). Other than in connection with the cashless exercise of any Company
Stock Options, there are no outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities.
There are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party
relating to the voting of any shares of capital stock of the Company. Section
3.2(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth information regarding the
current exercise price, date of grant and number granted of Company Stock
Options for each holder thereof. Following the Effective Time, no holder of
Company Stock Options will have any right to receive shares of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation upon exercise of the Company Stock Options.

                     (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, all of the outstanding capital stock of the Company's
subsidiaries is owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of
any Lien, other than Permitted Exceptions, or any other limitation or
restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote or sell the same,
except as may be provided as a matter of Law). Except as set forth in Section
3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no securities of the
Company or its subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for, no options or
other rights to acquire from the Company or its subsidiaries, and no other
contract, understanding, arrangement or obligation (whether or not contingent)
providing for the issuance or sale, directly or indirectly of, any capital stock
or other ownership interests in, or any other securities of, any subsidiary of
the Company. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or
its subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding
shares of capital stock or other ownership interests in any subsidiary of the
Company. For purposes of this Agreement, "LIEN" means any mortgage, lien, claim,
pledge, option, charge, right of first refusal, agreement, limitation on the
Company's or any subsidiary of the Company's voting rights, security interest or
other encumbrance of any kind or nature whatsoever. Except as set forth in
Section 3.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or any of the Company's subsidiaries to
provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any subsidiary of the Company that is not wholly
owned by the Company or to or in any other person.

                     SECTION 3.3 Authority Relative to This Agreement; Consents
and Approvals. (a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions


                                        7
<PAGE>
contemplated hereby. No other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger and this Agreement,
the Company Requisite Vote). This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid, legal and binding
agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms.

                     (b) The Board of Directors of the Company (the "COMPANY
BOARD") has duly and validly authorized the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and approved the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and has taken all corporate actions required to be taken by the Company Board
for the consummation of the transactions, including the Merger, contemplated
hereby and has resolved (i) to deem this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, taken together, advisable and fair
to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders; and (ii) to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company approve and adopt this Agreement.
The Company Board has directed that this Agreement be submitted to the
stockholders of the Company for their approval. The affirmative approval of the
holders of Shares representing a majority of the votes that may be cast by the
holders of all outstanding Shares (voting as a single class) as of the record
date for the Company (the "COMPANY REQUISITE VOTE") is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Company necessary to
adopt this Agreement and approve the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger.

                     SECTION 3.4 SEC Reports; Financial Statements. The Company
and each of its subsidiaries that files forms, reports and documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") have filed all required forms,
statements, reports and documents with the SEC since the later of January 1,
1999 or the date on which any such filing obligation arose (collectively, the
"COMPANY SEC REPORTS"), each of which has complied in all material respects with
all applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"ACT"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "EXCHANGE ACT"), or
both, as the case may be, each as in effect on the dates such Company SEC
Reports were filed. Except as set forth in Section 3.4 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or as and to the extent amended, modified, restated or revised in any
subsequent Company SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement, none of
the Company SEC Reports, including any financial statements or schedules
included or incorporated by reference therein, contained, when filed, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries,
including all related notes and schedules, contained in the Company SEC Reports
complied as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and fairly present
(on a consolidated basis, if applicable) (i) the financial position of the
Company or its subsidiary providing the financial statements, as applicable, as
of the dates thereof, and (ii) its results of operations, cash flows and changes
in stockholders' equity for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of the
unaudited interim financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments). Since
December 31, 2001 (the "AUDIT DATE"), there has not been any material change, or


                                        8
<PAGE>
any application or request for any material change, by the Company or any of its
subsidiaries in accounting principles, methods or policies for financial
accounting or Tax purposes (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

                     SECTION 3.5 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as and to
the extent publicly disclosed by the Company in the Company SEC Reports filed
prior to the date of this Agreement or as set forth in Section 3.5 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, none of the Company or its subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or
otherwise, and whether due or to become due or asserted or unasserted, whether
or not required by GAAP to be reflected in, reserved against or otherwise
described in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries (in each case including the notes thereto), which have or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set forth in the Company SEC Reports
filed prior to the date of this Agreement or in Section 3.5 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, there are no related-party transactions or off-balance
sheet structures or transactions with respect to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries that would be required to be reported or set forth therein pursuant
to the Exchange Act or the rules promulgated by the SEC thereunder.

                     SECTION 3.6 Absence of Changes. Except as and to the extent
publicly disclosed by the Company in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the
date of this Agreement or in Section 3.6 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
since the Audit Date, the business of the Company and each of its three
principal casino operating subsidiaries has been carried on only in the ordinary
and usual course consistent with past practice, and none of the Company or its
subsidiaries has incurred any liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise, which do or which would reasonably be expected to have,
and there have been no events, changes or effects with respect to the Company or
its subsidiaries which do or which would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                     SECTION 3.7 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. (a)
Except for such filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may
be required by or under, and other applicable requirements of, the Act, the
Exchange Act, state securities or blue sky Laws, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR ACT"), the American Stock
Exchange, any Gaming Authority, such filings, permits, authorizations, consents
and approvals relating or applicable to Parent or any of its subsidiaries and
not the Company or any of its subsidiaries, the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL or as otherwise set forth in
Sections 3.7(a) or (b) to the Company Disclosure Schedule, no filing with or
notice to, and no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any court or
tribunal or administrative, governmental or regulatory body, agency or
authority, including any Gaming Authority (a "GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY"), is
necessary for the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement or the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby, except
where the failure to obtain such permits, authorizations, consents or approvals
or to make such filings or give such notice would not and would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, (i) materially impair,
materially delay, or prevent the performance of this Agreement or the Merger, or
(ii) materially impair the ability of the Surviving Corporation and its


                                        9
<PAGE>
subsidiaries to conduct their respective businesses in a substantially similar
manner as conducted by the Company and the Company's subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time.

                     (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.7(b) to the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provision of the respective certificate or articles of incorporation or bylaws
(or similar governing documents) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii)
result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without due notice or
lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of termination,
amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien (other than Permitted
Exceptions)) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other
instrument or obligation (collectively, "CONTRACTS") to which the Company or any
of its subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their
respective properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) violate any Law
(including any Gaming Law) applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties or assets or any Company Permit, except in
the case of (ii) or (iii) for violations, breaches or defaults which do not or
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                     SECTION 3.8 No Default. Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries are in violation of any term of (a) its certificate of
incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents, (b) any Contract or (c)
any foreign or domestic law, order, writ, injunction, decree, ordinance, award,
stipulation, statute, judicial or administrative doctrine, rule or regulation
entered by a Governmental Entity including any Gaming Law ("LAW") applicable to
the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, the consequence of which violation does or would reasonably be expected
to (i) have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or (ii) prevent or materially delay the performance of this Agreement by
the Company.

                     SECTION 3.9 Real Property. (a) Section 3.9(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all of the material real property owned
in fee by the Company and its subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries has good and marketable title to each parcel of real property owned
by it, free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Exceptions.

                     (b) Section 3.9(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth all material leases, subleases and other agreements (the "REAL PROPERTY
LEASES") under which the Company or any of its subsidiaries uses or occupies or
has the right to use or occupy, now or in the future, any real property. Each
Real Property Lease constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation of the
Company or its subsidiary that is a party thereto, as the case may be,
enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be
limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
fraudulent transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights or by general equity principles), and is in full
force and effect. All rents and other sums and charges payable by the Company
and its subsidiaries as tenants under the Real Property Leases are materially
current and no termination event or condition or uncured default of a material
nature on the part of the Company or any such subsidiary or, to the Company's
knowledge, the landlord, exists under any Real Property Lease. Each of the


                                       10
<PAGE>
Company and its subsidiaries has a good and valid leasehold interest in each
parcel of real property leased by it, free and clear of all Liens, other than
Permitted Exceptions.

                     (c) No party to any Real Property Lease has given written
notice to the Company or any of its subsidiaries of or made a claim against the
Company or any of its subsidiaries with respect to, any breach or default
thereunder, in any such case in which such breach or default does or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company.

                     SECTION 3.10 Litigation. Except as disclosed in Section
3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or any of the Company SEC Reports filed
after January 1, 2002 but prior to the date of this Agreement, there is no
claim, action, proceeding or known investigation (collectively, "CLAIM") pending
or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, including by or
before any Governmental Entity, which (a) does or would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company or (b) as of the date hereof, questions the validity of this Agreement
or any action to be taken by the Company in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or could otherwise prevent or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as
disclosed in Section 3.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or any of the
Company SEC Reports filed after January 1, 2002 but prior to the date of this
Agreement, none of the Company or its subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding
order, writ, injunction or decree which does or would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

                     SECTION 3.11 Compliance with Applicable Law. The Company
and its subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders
and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of
their respective businesses (the "COMPANY PERMITS"), except for failures to hold
such permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals which do not
or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Except as set forth in Section 3.11 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and its subsidiaries and each of
their respective "key persons" (as defined under applicable Gaming Law) are in
compliance with the terms of the Company Permits, except where the failure to so
comply does not or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. The businesses of the
Company and its subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any Law
applicable to the Company or its subsidiaries, except for violations or possible
violations which do not and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Except as set forth in Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the
Company's knowledge, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Company or its subsidiaries is pending or threatened, nor, to the
Company's knowledge, has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to
conduct the same, other than those which do not or would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

                     SECTION 3.12 Employee Plans. (a) Section 3.12(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list, as of the date

                                       11
<PAGE>
the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), all
material employment, severance, individual consulting, individual compensation

obligation or liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to any current or
former employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each an "EMPLOYEE
BENEFIT PLAN" and collectively, the "EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS"). For purposes of
this Agreement, "ERISA AFFILIATE" means any Person that, together with the
Company, would be treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code or
Section 4001 of ERISA and any general partnership of which the Company is or has
been a general partner. Except as set forth on Section 3.12(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, none of the Employee Benefit Plans is a multiemployer plan,
as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA ("MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN"), or is or has been
subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA ("MULTIPLE EMPLOYER PLANS"), and
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate contributes to or has any liability
under any Multiemployer Plan.

                     (b) True, correct and complete copies of the following
documents, to the extent such documents are applicable with respect to each of
the Employee Benefit Plans (other than a Multiemployer Plan) have been made
available or delivered to Parent by the Company: (i) any plans and related trust
documents, and amendments thereto; (ii) the most recent Forms 5500 and schedules
thereto; (iii) the most recent Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") determination
letter; (iv) the most recent financial statements and actuarial valuations
prepared for such Employee Benefit Plans, if applicable; and (v) the most recent
summary plan descriptions.

                     (c) To the knowledge of the Company, except as disclosed in
Section 3.12(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule: (i) all material payments
required to be made by or under any Employee Benefit Plan, any related trusts,
or any collective bargaining agreement or pursuant to Law have been made by the
due date thereof (including any valid extension); (ii) the Company and its ERISA
Affiliates have timely performed in all material respects all obligations
required to be performed by them under any Employee Benefit Plan; (iii) the
Employee Benefit Plans, have been administered in compliance with their terms
and the requirements of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws; (iv) there
are no actions, suits, arbitrations or claims (other than routine claims for
benefit) pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan; and (v) the Company and its ERISA Affiliates have no
liability as a result of any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Section 406
of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code) for any excise Tax or civil penalty.

                     (d) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(d) of the Company
Disclosure Statement:

         (i)      None of the Employee Benefit Plans is subject to Title IV of
                  ERISA. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has any
                  liability under Title IV of ERISA.


                                       12
<PAGE>
         (ii)     Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate or any
                  organization to which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate is a
                  successor or parent corporation, within the meaning of Section
                  4069(b) of ERISA, has engaged in any transaction within the
                  last five years which might be alleged to come within the
                  meaning of Section 4069 of ERISA.

                     (e) To the knowledge of the Company, each of the Employee
Benefit Plans which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Code has been determined by the IRS to be so "qualified" and the
trusts maintained pursuant thereto are exempt from federal income taxation under
Section 501 of the Code, and the Company knows of no fact which would adversely
affect the qualified status of any such Employee Benefit Plan or the exemption
of such trust in each case, in a manner that would result in a material
liability to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.

                     (f) Except as set forth in Section 3.12(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule or as required by other applicable Law, none of the Employee
Benefit Plans provide for continuing retiree health, retiree medical or retiree
life insurance coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant.

Disclosure Schedule, no stock or other security issued by the Company forms or
has formed a material part of the assets of any Employee Benefit Plan.

                     (h) Except as contemplated by this Agreement or disclosed
in Section 3.12(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will by itself or in combination with any other event: (i) result in any
bonus, retirement, severance or other payment becoming due, or increase the
amount of compensation due, to any current or former employee of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Employee Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment
or vesting of any such material benefits or (iv) result in any job security or
similar benefit or increased such benefit.

                     (i) If the Effective Time occurs after December 31, 2002,
except as provided in the written materials provided to Parent on or about
August 5, 2002, to the Company's knowledge, other than de minimis amounts, there
would be no amounts payable under any contract, plan or arrangement (written or
otherwise) covering any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its
ERISA Affiliates that would not be deductible pursuant to the terms of Sections
162(m) or 280G of the Code.

                     (j) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates do not maintain,
sponsor or have any liability (contingent or otherwise) with respect to any
Employee Benefit Plan outside the United States.

Company or any of its subsidiaries is or has been a member, have timely filed

and each of its subsidiaries have paid (or the Company has paid on its

The most recent consolidated financial statements contained in the Company SEC

which are being contested or disputed in good faith or for which the applicable
amount has not been assessed or determined by the appropriate taxing authority.

Permitted Exceptions) upon any of the assets of the Company or any of its

of attorney with respect to any Taxes has been executed or filed with any taxing
authority. No material issues relating to Taxes have been raised in writing by
the relevant taxing authority during any pending audit or examination or
otherwise.

                     (c) None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a

forth a list of all Material Contracts. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all written Contracts
(and all amendments, modifications and supplements thereto and all side letters
to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party affecting the
obligations of any party thereunder) to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or by which any of its properties or assets are bound
that are either filed (including through incorporation by reference) as an
exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2001 of either the Company or Hollywood Casino Shreveport, a Louisiana general
partnership and Shreveport Capital Corporation, a Louisiana corporation, or
otherwise that are material to the business, properties or assets of the Company
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, including, without limitation, to the
extent any of the following are, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the business, properties or assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as

non-competition or indemnification contracts (including, without limitation, any
contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party involving
employees of the Company); (ii) contracts granting a right of first refusal or
first negotiation; (iii) partnership or joint venture agreements; (iv)

                     (b) Each of the Material Contracts constitutes the valid
and legally binding obligation of the Company or its subsidiaries, enforceable
in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
transfer and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights or by general equity principles). There is no default under
any Material Contract so listed either by the Company or, to the Company's
knowledge, by any other party thereto, and no event has occurred that with the
lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default
thereunder by the Company or, to the Company's knowledge, any other party, in
any such case in which such default or event does or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

                     (c) No party to any such Material Contract has given
written notice to the Company of or made a Claim against the Company with
respect to any breach or default thereunder, in any such case in which such
breach or default does or would reasonably be expected to have, individually or

used in connection with the business of the Company and its subsidiaries as
currently conducted or as reasonably contemplated to be conducted.

                     (c) To the Company's knowledge, the use by the Company of
any Intellectual Property owned by the Company and its subsidiaries does not
infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any person other than as would

have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company.

Property or, to the Company's knowledge, has a basis to make any such material
claim in the future.

                     SECTION 3.19 Opinion of Financial Advisor. Goldman, Sachs &
Co. (the "COMPANY FINANCIAL ADVISOR") has delivered to the Company Board its

the Merger Consideration is fair to the holders of Shares from a financial point
of view.

                     SECTION 3.20 Brokers. No broker, finder or investment
banker (other than the Company Financial Advisor) is entitled to any brokerage,

Company Board has taken all necessary action (including any amendment thereof)
under the Rights Agreement, dated as of May 7, 1993, between the Company and
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the "COMPANY RIGHTS
AGREEMENT"), so that (a) none of the execution or delivery of this Agreement,
the exchange of the Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Article II, or any other transaction contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
will cause (i) the rights (the "RIGHTS") issued pursuant to the Company Rights
Agreement to become exercisable under the Company Rights Agreement, (ii) Parent
or Merger Sub to be deemed an "ACQUIRING PERSON" (as defined in the Company
Rights Agreement), or (iii) a "TRIGGERING EVENT," a "STOCK ACQUISITION DATE" or
a "DISTRIBUTION DATE" (each as defined in the Company Rights Agreement) to occur
upon any such event; and (b) the "EXPIRATION DATE" (as defined in the Company
Rights Agreement) of the Rights shall occur immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

                     SECTION 3.23 Noncompetition Agreements. Except as required
by any Gaming Laws or Gaming Authorities or licenses issued thereunder or
thereby or as set forth in Section 3.23 of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any agreement that
purports to restrict or prohibit in any material respect the Company or any of
its subsidiaries from, directly or indirectly, engaging in any business
currently engaged in by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. To the knowledge
of the Company, none of the Company's officers or key employees is a party to
any agreement that restricts such officer or key employee from acting as an
officer or employee of an entity engaged in any business engaged in by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, except for those restrictions which do not
or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

                     SECTION 3.24 Completeness of Disclosure. Neither this
Agreement nor any certificate, schedule, statement, document or instrument to be
executed by the Company in connection with the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, contains or will contain any untrue statement of

stated herein or therein or necessary to make any statement herein or therein
not misleading.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                            OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

                     Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered by
Parent to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "PARENT
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly
numbered representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified
therein), and except, with respect to Sections 4.3, 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 hereof, as
to matters which would not or would not reasonably be expected to, materially
impair, materially delay or prevent the Merger or the consummation of the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter (as defined herein), Parent and
Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant to the Company as follows:


                                       20
<PAGE>
                     SECTION 4.1 Organization. (a) Each of Parent and its
subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, and has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business
as now conducted or proposed by Parent to be conducted.

                     (b) Each of Parent and its subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing does not
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                     SECTION 4.2 Authority Relative to This Agreement. (a) Each
of Parent and Merger Sub has all necessary corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. No other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and constitutes a valid,
legal and binding agreement of each of Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable
against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance with its terms.

                     (b) The Boards of Directors of Parent (the "PARENT BOARD")
and Merger Sub and Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub have duly and
validly authorized the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and have taken all
corporate actions required to be taken by such Boards of Directors and Parent as
the sole stockholder of Merger Sub for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

                     SECTION 4.3 SEC Reports; Financial Statements. Parent has
filed all required forms, statements, reports and documents with the SEC since
the later of January 1, 1999 or the date on which any such filing obligation
arose (collectively, "PARENT SEC Reports"), each of which has complied in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act,
or both, as the case may be, each as in effect on the dates such Parent SEC
Reports were filed. Except as and to the extent amended, modified, restated or
revised in any subsequent Parent SEC Report filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, none of the Parent SEC Reports, including any financial statements or
schedules included or incorporated by reference therein, contained, when filed,
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated or incorporated by reference therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements, including all
related notes and schedules, contained in the Parent SEC Reports complied as to
form in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), and fairly
present (i) the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries, as of the dates thereof, and (ii) the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity for the periods then


                                       21
<PAGE>
ended (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim financial statements, to
normal year-end adjustments) for Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries. Since
the Audit Date, there has not been any material change, or any application or
request for any material change, by Parent or any of its consolidated
subsidiaries in accounting principles, methods or policies for financial
accounting or Tax purposes (subject, in the case of the unaudited interim
financial statements, to normal year-end adjustments).

                     SECTION 4.4 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as and to
the extent publicly disclosed by Parent in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, none of Parent or its consolidated subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent
or otherwise, and whether due or to become due or asserted or unasserted,
whether or not required by GAAP to be reflected in, reserved against or
otherwise described in the consolidated balance sheet of Parent (including the
notes thereto), which have or would reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                     SECTION 4.5 Absence of Changes. Except as and to the extent
publicly disclosed by Parent in the Parent SEC Reports filed prior to the date
of this Agreement, since the Audit Date, the business of Parent and each of its
subsidiaries has been carried on only in the ordinary and usual course
consistent with past practice, none of Parent or its subsidiaries has incurred
any liabilities of any nature, whether or not accrued, contingent or otherwise,
which do or which would reasonably be expected to have, and there have been no
events, changes or effects with respect to Parent or its subsidiaries which do
or which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                     SECTION 4.6 Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except
for such filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be
required under, and other applicable requirements of, the Act, the Exchange Act,
state securities or blue sky Laws, the HSR Act, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.
("NASDAQ"), any Gaming Authority, such filings, permits, authorization, consents
and approvals relating or applicable to the Company or any of its subsidiaries
and not Parent or any of its subsidiaries, the filing and recordation of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, and as otherwise set forth in
Section 4.6 to the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no filing with or notice to, and
no permit, authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity is
necessary for the execution and delivery by Parent or Merger Sub of this
Agreement or the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except where the failure to obtain such permits,
authorizations, consents or approvals or to make such filings or give such
notice would not and would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, materially impair, materially delay, or prevent the performance of
this Agreement or the Merger. Neither the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub nor the consummation by Parent or Merger
Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in
any breach of any provision of the respective articles of incorporation or
bylaws (or similar governing documents) of Parent or Merger Sub or any of
Parent's subsidiaries, (ii) result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to
any right of termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien (other
than Permitted Exceptions)) under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of
any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of Parent's subsidiaries is a


                                       22
<PAGE>
party or by which any of them or any of their respective properties or assets
may be bound, or (iii) violate any Law applicable to Parent or Merger Sub or any
of Parent's subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or assets, except
in the case of (ii) or (iii), for violations, breaches or defaults which do not
or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                     SECTION 4.7 Litigation. Except as and to the extent
publicly disclosed by Parent in the Parent SEC Reports filed after January 1,
2002 but prior to the date of this Agreement, there is no Claim pending or, to
Parent's knowledge, threatened against Parent or any of its subsidiaries or any
of their respective properties or assets, including by or before any
Governmental Entity, which (a) does or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent or (b) as
of the date hereof, questions the validity of this Agreement or any action to be
taken by Parent in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or could otherwise prevent or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except as and to the extent
publicly disclosed by Parent in the Parent SEC Reports filed after January 1,
2002 but prior to the date of this Agreement, none of Parent or its subsidiaries
is subject to any outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree which does or
would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

                     SECTION 4.8 Compliance with Applicable Law. Parent and its
subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and
approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses (the "PARENT PERMITS"), except for failures to hold such
permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and approvals which do not or
would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Except as set forth in Section 4.8 of the
Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent and its subsidiaries and each of their
respective "key persons" (as defined under applicable Gaming Law) are in
compliance with the terms of the Parent Permits, except where the failure to so
comply does not or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. The businesses of Parent and
its subsidiaries are not being conducted in violation of any Law applicable to
Parent or its subsidiaries, except for violations or possible violations which
do not and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To Parent's knowledge, no
investigation or review by any Governmental Entity with respect to Parent or its
subsidiaries is pending or threatened, nor, to Parent's knowledge, has any
Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the same, other than, in
each case, those which Parent reasonably believes do not or would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.

                     SECTION 4.9 No Prior Activities. Except for obligations
incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization or the negotiation
and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
Merger Sub has neither incurred any obligation or liability to nor engaged in
any business or activity of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any
agreement or arrangement with any person.

                     SECTION 4.10 Brokers. Except as set forth in Section 4.10
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, no broker, finder or investment banker (other
than Lehman Brothers, Inc.) is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other


                                       23
<PAGE>
advisory fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by and on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub or any of their affiliates.

                     SECTION 4.11 Financing. Parent has obtained a written
commitment (the "COMMITMENT LETTER") from Bear Stearns & Co. Inc., Bear Stearns
Corporate Lending Inc. (collectively, "BEAR") and Merrill Lynch Capital
Corporation ("MERRILL") to provide financing in connection with the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, a true and correct copy
of which has been provided by Parent to the Company. The Commitment Letter has
not been amended and is in full force and effect. Parent does not know of any
facts that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
materially impair, materially delay or prevent the consummation of the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter or that would cause the funds to be
provided by Bear and Merrill under the Commitment Letter to be insufficient to
fund Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under this Agreement or as otherwise
required or contemplated by or under the Commitment Letter.

                     SECTION 4.12 No Ownership of Securities. None of Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries own, beneficially, or of
record, any Shares or other debt or equity securities of the Company, except for
not more than 100 shares of the Company Common Stock owned by Parent or its
subsidiaries.

                     SECTION 4.13 Completeness of Disclosure. Neither this
Agreement nor any certificate, schedule, statement, document or instrument to be
executed by Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the negotiation, execution
or performance of this Agreement, contains or will contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits or will omit to state a material fact required to be
stated herein or therein or necessary to make any statement herein or therein
not misleading.

                                    ARTICLE V

                    COVENANTS RELATED TO CONDUCT OF BUSINESS

                     SECTION 5.1 Conduct of Business of the Company. Except as
contemplated by this Agreement, or to the extent prohibited or required by any
Gaming Authority or to the extent a prior approval of a Gaming Authority is
required to agree to the undertaking, during the period from the date hereof to
the Effective Time, the Company will use reasonable best efforts and will cause
each of its subsidiaries to use reasonable best efforts to conduct its
operations in the ordinary and usual course of business consistent with past
practice (including with respect to its capital maintenance programs) and, to
the extent consistent therewith, with no less diligence and effort than would be
applied in the absence of this Agreement, seek to preserve intact the current
business organizations of the Company and each of its subsidiaries, keep
available the service of the current officers and employees of the Company and
each of its subsidiaries and preserve the Company's and its subsidiaries'
relationships with customers, suppliers and all others having business dealings
with the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the end that goodwill and ongoing
businesses shall be materially unimpaired at the Effective Time. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement or in Section 5.1(g) or (m) of the Company Disclosure


                                       24

                     (o) waive, release, assign, settle or compromise any
pending or threatened suit, action or claim relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby or any other rights, claims or litigation material to the
Company or any of its three principal casino operating subsidiaries or regarding
an amount in excess of $50,000 for any of the Company's other subsidiaries;

                     (p) except as otherwise required by Law, enter into any or

materiality becoming untrue, (ii) result in any of such representations and
warranties that are not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect,
(iii) result in any of the conditions to the consummation of the Merger, the
financing under the Commitment Letter or the other transactions contemplated
hereby not being satisfied, or (iv) materially impair, materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

                     SECTION 5.3 Access to Information. (a) Between the date
hereof and the Effective Time, the Company (i) will give Parent and Merger Sub

and those of its subsidiaries to furnish Parent and Merger Sub promptly with

subsidiaries as Parent or Merger Sub may from time to time reasonably request,
including in the case of (i), (ii) and (iii), promptly providing such access,
inspections and financial operating data and other information (including

                                   ARTICLE VI

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

                     SECTION 6.1 Stockholder Meeting. The Company shall take all
lawful action to (a) cause its annual meeting of stockholders or a special
meeting of its stockholders (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER MEETING") to be duly
called and held as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement for the
purpose of voting on the approval and adoption of this Agreement and (b) solicit
proxies from its stockholders to obtain the Company Requisite Vote for the
approval and adoption of this Agreement. The Company Board shall recommend
approval and adoption by the Company's stockholders of this Agreement and the
Merger and, except as permitted by Section 6.6, the Company Board shall not
withdraw, amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent such recommendation (or
announce publicly its intention to do so).

                     SECTION 6.2 Preparation of the Proxy Statement. The Company
will, as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and in
any event, within forty-five (45) days after the date hereof), prepare and file
with the SEC the proxy statement and any amendments or supplements thereto
relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting to be held in connection with the
Merger (the "PROXY STATEMENT"). Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate with the
Company in the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement. The Company will
provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy
Statement prior to filing. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to have
the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly thereafter as practicable.
The Company shall, as promptly as practicable after the receipt thereof, provide
to Parent copies of any written comments and advise Parent of any oral comments


                                       28
<PAGE>
with respect to the Proxy Statement received from the staff of the SEC. The
Company will provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on any amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to filing with the
SEC and will provide Parent with a copy of all such filings with the SEC. The
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to its stockholders at the earliest practicable date.

                     SECTION 6.3 Company Information Supplied. The Company
covenants that the Proxy Statement will not, at the date mailed to stockholders
of the Company and at the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting to be held in
connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
event with respect to the Company, its officers or directors or any of its
subsidiaries should occur which is required to be described in an amendment of,
or a supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly so advise
Parent and such event shall be so described, and such amendment or supplement
(which Parent shall have a reasonable opportunity to review) shall be promptly
filed with the SEC and, as required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of
the Company. The Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to the Company
Stockholder Meeting, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder.

                     SECTION 6.4 Parent and Merger Sub Information Supplied.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub covenant that none of the information supplied or
to be supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Proxy Statement
will, at the date mailed to stockholders and at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any event with
respect to Parent, its officers or directors or any of its subsidiaries should
occur which is required to be described in an amendment of, or a supplement to,
the Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly so advise the Company of such event
in sufficient detail to allow the Company to prepare and file any such amendment
or supplement.

                     SECTION 6.5 Efforts; Cooperation. (a) Subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, to (i) obtain from
Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made by Parent or the
Company or any of their subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) make all necessary filings,
and thereafter make any other submissions either required or deemed appropriate
by each of the parties, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby required under (A) the Act, the Exchange
Act, any other applicable federal or state securities or blue sky Laws, (B) the
HSR Act, (C) the DGCL, (D) any other applicable Law, (E) any Gaming Laws
applicable to such party and (F) the rules and regulations of the American Stock


                                       29
<PAGE>
Exchange. The parties hereto shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all such filings, including by providing copies of
all such documents to the nonfiling party and its advisors prior to filing, and,
except as required by Law, none of the parties will file any such document if
any of the other parties shall have reasonably objected to the filing of such
document. No party to this Agreement shall consent to any voluntary extension of
any statutory deadline or waiting period or to any voluntary delay of the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby at the
behest of any Governmental Entity without the consent and agreement of the other
parties to this Agreement, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable and in any event within twenty (20) business days of the
date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information
and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, as promptly as
practicable all other actions consistent with this Section 6.5 necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the
HSR Act as soon as practicable.

                     (b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.5(a), each
of Parent and the Company shall (i) cooperate in all material respects with each
other in connection with any filing or submission and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry, including any proceeding initiated by a private
party; and (ii) keep the other party promptly informed in all material respects
of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such
party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice or any other Governmental Entity and of any material communication
received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each
case regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby. For purposes of this
Agreement, "ANTITRUST LAW" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act,
as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all
other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

                     (c) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.5(a), each
of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly
and expeditiously as practicable, (i) file all required applications for Parent
and all "key persons" (as defined under applicable Gaming Laws) to obtain the
necessary approvals from all applicable Gaming Authorities in order to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; and (ii) request an accelerated
review from such Gaming Authorities in connection with such filings.

                     (d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants
of the parties contained in Sections 6.5(a), (b) and (c), each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections, if
any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Entity or other person with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law or Gaming Law or by
any Gaming Authority. In connection with the foregoing, if any administrative or
judicial action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, Gaming Law or
the rules and regulations of any Gaming Authority, each of Parent and the
Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its respective


                                       30
<PAGE>
reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary
or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section
6.5 shall (i) limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Article VIII so long as such party has up to then complied in all material
respects with its obligations under this Section 6.5, or (ii) require Parent to
(A) dispose of or hold separate any part of its or the Company's businesses or
operations (or a combination of Parent's and the Company's businesses or
operations), (B) agree not to compete in any geographic area or line of business
or (C) remove or replace any "key person" (as defined under applicable Gaming
Laws), except, in each case, as would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

                     (e) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.5(a), the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent in its
efforts to secure the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter.

                     (f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company shall prevent the Foreign Subs from conducting any business.

                     SECTION 6.6 Acquisition Proposals. (a) From the date hereof
until the termination hereof and except as expressly permitted by the following
provisions of this Section 6.6, the Company will not, nor will it permit any of
its subsidiaries to, nor will it authorize or permit any officer, director,
employee or agent of, or any investment banker, attorney, accountant or other
advisor or representative of, the Company or any of its subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or encourage any inquiries, offers
or proposals that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a
proposal or offer for (x) any merger, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, business combination or similar transaction, (y) any sale,
lease, exchange, mortgage, transfer or other disposition, in a single
transaction or series of related transactions, of assets representing twenty
percent (20%) or more of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (z) sale of shares of capital stock representing, individually or
in the aggregate, twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the
Company other than to the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, including,
without limitation, by way of a tender offer or exchange offer by any person
(other than the Company or a subsidiary of the Company) for shares of capital
stock representing twenty percent (20%) or more of the voting power of the
Company (any of the foregoing inquiries, offers or proposals being referred to
in this Agreement as an "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL"), (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations concerning, or provide to any person or entity any
information or data relating to the Company or any subsidiary of the Company for
the purposes of making, or take any other action to facilitate, any Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may
reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) agree to,
approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or (iv) take any other action
materially inconsistent with the obligations and commitments assumed by the
Company pursuant to this Section 6.6; provided, however, that, subject to the
Company's compliance with this Section 6.6, nothing contained in this Section
6.6 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company
Board from, either prior to receipt of the Company Requisite Vote or at any time
after February 28, 2003, (A) entering into a definitive agreement providing for


                                       31
<PAGE>
the implementation of a Superior Proposal if the Company or the Company Board is
concurrently terminating this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a), (B)
furnishing non-public information to, entering into customary confidentiality
agreements with, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person
or entity in connection with an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal to the Company or its stockholders, if the Company Board determines in
its good faith reasonable judgment after consultation with the Company Financial
Advisor or other nationally-recognized independent financial advisors that such
Acquisition Proposal, if accepted, constitutes, or is reasonably likely to lead
to or result in, a Superior Proposal or (C) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position with respect to such Acquisition Proposal contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making any other public
disclosure that the Company Board determines in its good faith reasonable
judgment, after consultation with independent legal counsel, is required under
applicable Law. The Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing, and will promptly inform the
individuals or entities referred to in the first sentence of this Section 6.6(a)
of the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.6.

                     (b) The Company shall (i) promptly (and in any event no
later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt by the Company Board or a senior
executive officer of the Company) notify Parent orally and in writing after
receipt by the Company (or its advisors) of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiries indicating that any person is considering making or wishes to make, or
which may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, including
the material terms and conditions thereof and the identity of the person making
it, (ii) promptly (and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) hours after
receipt by the Company Board or a senior executive officer of the Company)
notify Parent orally and in writing after receipt of any request for non-public
information relating to it or any of its subsidiaries or for access to its or
any of its subsidiaries' properties, books or records by any person that, to the
Company's knowledge, may be considering making, or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal, and (iii) receive from any person that may make or has made an
Acquisition Proposal and that requests non-public information relating to the
Company and/or any of its subsidiaries, an executed confidentiality letter in
reasonably customary form and containing terms that are as stringent in all
material respects as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement prior to
delivery of any such non-public information. Oral notice shall be deemed given
by making a telephone call to Robert Krauss at 215.864.8202 and speaking with
him directly or leaving a voice mail message or to such other person and
telephone number as may be directed in writing by Parent. Written notice shall
be deemed given to Parent upon notice to Parent in accordance with Section 9.3.

                     (c) The Company Board will not withdraw or modify, or
propose to withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to Parent, its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger except in connection with a
Superior Proposal and then only upon or after the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.3(a).

                     SECTION 6.7 Public Announcements. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company will consult with one another before issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by any


                                       32
<PAGE>
applicable Gaming Authority, Governmental Entity or Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with the American Stock Exchange or Nasdaq, as
determined by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, in which
case the issuing party shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult with the
other parties before issuing any such release or making any such public
statement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will not publicly
disclose any guidance concerning the expected earnings or other performance of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Company
shall publicly disclose that it is no longer providing such guidance as a result
of the requirements of this Section 6.7 and shall be permitted to provide
guidance if, based on the advice of outside legal counsel, the provision of such
guidance is required or advisable under applicable Law.

                     SECTION 6.8 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers'
Insurance.

                     (a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the parties hereto
(each, an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY" and, collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES")
against all losses, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), Claims, damages or liabilities or, subject to the proviso of the next
succeeding sentence, amounts paid in, settlement, arising out of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time that are in whole or in part
(i) based on, or arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director
or officer of such party or (ii) based on, arising out of or pertaining to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of any such loss,
expense, Claim, damage or liability (whether or not arising before the Effective
Time), (i) Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected
by such Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, promptly after statements therefor are received and otherwise advance to
such Indemnified Party upon request reimbursement of documented expenses
reasonably incurred, in either case to the extent not prohibited by applicable
Law and upon receipt of any affirmation and undertaking required by applicable
Law, (ii) Parent will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an Indemnified Party's
conduct complies with the standards set forth under applicable Law and Parent's
articles of incorporation or bylaws shall be made by independent counsel
mutually acceptable to Parent and the Indemnified Party; provided, however, that
Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).

                     (b) After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be
maintained in effect a policy of directors' and officers' liability insurance
providing tail coverage for the benefit of those persons who are covered by a
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by the Company at
the Effective Time for the maximum term and coverage (not to exceed the coverage
amount provided by the Company's policy that was effective on November 1, 2001)
that can be obtained for the payment of an aggregate premium cost to Parent not
greater than six hundred percent (600%) of the annual premium payable by the
Company for its directors' and officers' liability insurance that was effective
as of November 1, 2001, the amount of coverage and term of such policy to be
advised by the Company to Parent.


                                       33
<PAGE>
                     (c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.8.

                     (d) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, from and after
the Effective Time, all rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses
now existing in favor of the employees, agents, directors or officers of the
Company and its subsidiaries with respect to their activities as such prior to
the Effective Time, as provided in the Company's certificate of incorporation or
bylaws, in effect on the date thereof or otherwise in effect on the date hereof,
all of which the Company represents are listed on Schedule 6.6, shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of not less
than six years from the Effective Time.

                     (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives.

                     SECTION 6.9 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company
shall give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and Parent and Merger Sub
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence of which would be likely to cause
any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement which is qualified as
to materiality to be untrue or inaccurate, or any representation or warranty not
so qualified to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, at or prior to
the Effective Time, (b) any material failure of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder or under the
Commitment Letter, (c) any notice of, or other communication relating to, a
default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a
default, received by it or any of its subsidiaries subsequent to the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any contract or agreement
material to the financial condition, properties, businesses, results of
operations or prospects of it and its subsidiaries taken as a whole to which it
or any of its subsidiaries is a party or is subject, (d) any notice or other
communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such third party
is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (e) in the case of the Company, any Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, and in the case of Parent, any Material Adverse Effect on Parent;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.9
shall not cure such breach or non-compliance or limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or otherwise
affect the representations or warranties of any party or the conditions to the
obligations of any party hereunder.

                     SECTION 6.10 Employee Matters. (a) Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor the obligations of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under the provisions of all employment,
bonus, consulting, termination, severance, change in control and indemnification
agreements between and among the Company or any of its subsidiaries and any
current or former officer, director, consultant or employee of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, that this Section 6.10 shall not be


                                       34
<PAGE>
construed to limit Parent or the Surviving Corporation's ability to amend or
terminate any such agreement to the extent permitted by Law and the terms of
each such agreement.

                     (b) Following the Effective Time and for a period of 6
months thereafter, Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to provide, to all individuals who are employees of the Company at the Effective
Time and whose employment will continue following the Effective Time (the
"ASSUMED EMPLOYEES") with: (i) compensation, employee benefits, and terms and
conditions of employment that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, as
Parent provides to similarly-situated employees of Parent; (ii) compensation,
employee benefits, and terms and conditions of employment that are substantially
similar, in the aggregate, to those of the Company as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time; or (iii) a combination of clauses (i) and (ii);
provided that such compensation, employee benefits, and terms and conditions of
employment are substantially similar, in the aggregate, to those in effect for
the Assumed Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Following the
Effective Time, to the extent permitted by Law and applicable tax qualification
requirements, and subject to any generally applicable break in service or
similar rule, and the approval of any insurance carrier, third party provider or
the like with reasonable best efforts of Parent, each Assumed Employee shall
receive service credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting
(but not for benefit accrual purposes) for employment, compensation, and
employee benefit plan purposes with the Company prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, none of the provisions
contained herein shall operate to duplicate any benefit provided to any Assumed
Employee or the funding of any such benefit. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will also cause all (A) pre-existing conditions and proof of
insurability provisions, for all conditions that all Assumed Employees and their
covered dependents have as of the Closing, and (B) waiting periods under each
plan that would otherwise be applicable to newly hired employees to be waived in
the case of clause (A) or clause (B) with respect to Assumed Employees to the
same extent waived or satisfied under the Employee Benefit Plans; provided that
nothing in this sentence shall limit the ability of Parent or the Surviving

Assumed Employee credit, for purposes of Parent's and the Surviving
Corporation's vacation and/or other paid leave benefit programs, for such
employees accrued and unpaid vacation and/or paid leave balance as of the
Effective Time.

                     (d) Nothing contained in this Agreement is intended to (i)
confer upon any Assumed Employee any right to continued employment after the
Effective Time or (ii) prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation from
reserving the right to amend, modify or terminate any of their respective
benefit plans.

                     SECTION 6.11 SEC Filings. Each of Parent and the Company

delay or prevent the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter. Parent

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                         TERMINATION; AMENDMENT; WAIVER

                     SECTION 8.1 Termination by Mutual Agreement. This Agreement
may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after the approval of the Merger by the
Company Requisite Vote referred to in Section 7.1(a), by mutual written consent
of the Company and Parent by action of their respective Boards of Directors.

                     SECTION 8.2 Termination by Either Parent or the Company.
This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time
prior to the Effective Time by action of the Board of Directors of either Parent
or the Company if:

                     (a) the Merger shall not have been consummated on or before
two hundred seventy (270) days from the date of this Agreement, whether such
date is before or after the date of approval of the Merger by the Company
Requisite Vote (as may be extended as hereinafter provided, the "TERMINATION
DATE"); provided, however, that if either Parent or the Company determines that
additional time is necessary in connection with obtaining any consent,
registration, approval, permit or authorization required to be obtained from any
Gaming Authority, the Termination Date may be extended by Parent or the Company
from time to time by written notice to the other party to a date not beyond
three hundred sixty-five (365) days from the date of this Agreement.

                     (b) the Company Requisite Vote shall not have been obtained
at the Company Stockholder Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof;

                     (c) any Law permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting consummation of the Merger shall become final and non-appealable
(whether before or after the approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite
Vote); or


                                       39
<PAGE>
                     (d) any Governmental Entity shall have failed to issue an
order, decree or ruling or to take any other action which is necessary to
fulfill the conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) or 7.1(d), as applicable, and
(i) such denial of a request to issue such order, decree, ruling or take such
other action shall have been final and nonappealable or (ii) such order, decree,
ruling or other action is not reasonably likely to be issued or taken within one
year after the date hereof;

provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.2 shall not be available to any party that has breached in any material
respect its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that shall have
proximately contributed to the occurrence of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated.

                     SECTION 8.3 Termination by the Company. This Agreement may
be terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time by action of the Company Board:

                     (a) prior to the Company Requisite Vote or at any time
after February 28, 2003, if the Company Board shall have approved, and the
Company shall have concurrently entered into, a definitive agreement providing
for the implementation of a Superior Proposal, so long as such action is not
prohibited by Section 6.6;

                     (b) if there is a breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that
cannot be cured and would cause a condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) or
7.3(b) to be incapable of being satisfied as of the Termination Date; or

                     (c) upon written notice to Parent if (i) the Commitment
Letter shall have expired or have been terminated or (ii) prior to the end of
any calendar quarter ending after the date hereof or any calendar month ending
after January 31, 2002, the Company requests Parent to deliver to the Company a
certificate pursuant to this Section 8.3(c) and Parent does not within
forty-five (45) days of the end of such quarter or within thirty (30) days of
the end of such month, as applicable, deliver such certificate of Parent signed
by a responsible officer stating that the Commitment Letter is in full force and
effect and that, after inquiry of Bear and Merrill, Parent does not know of any
facts that would reasonably be expected to materially impair, materially delay
or prevent the consummation of the financing contemplated by the Commitment
Letter; provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this
Section 8.3(c) shall not be available to the Company unless within ten (10) days
of receiving written notice by the Company of its intention to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 8.3(c), Parent does not (A) secure an extension of
the Commitment Letter (if expired or terminated), (B) secure an amendment of the
Commitment Letter that allows it to deliver the certificate referenced in this
Section 8.3(c), or (C) secure a commitment letter for alternate or additional
financing upon terms reasonably acceptable to the Company. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.3(c)
shall not be available to the Company if it has breached in any material respect
its obligations under this Agreement in any manner that contributed to Parent's
inability to deliver the certificate referenced in this Section 8.3(c).


                                       40
<PAGE>
                     SECTION 8.4 Termination by Parent. This Agreement may be
terminated and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective
Time, by action of the Parent Board:

                     (a) if the Company enters into a binding agreement for a
Superior Proposal;

                     (b) if there is a breach by the Company of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement that
cannot be cured and would cause a condition set forth in Sections 7.2(a) or
7.2(b) to be incapable of being satisfied as of the Termination Date; or

                     (c) after the occurrence of a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company.

                     SECTION 8.5 Effect of Termination and Abandonment. In the
event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger
pursuant to this Article VIII, this Agreement (other than this Section 8.5 and
Sections 5.3(c), 6.12, 8.6 and Article IX) shall become void and of no effect
with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other
representatives); provided, however, that no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto of any liability or damages resulting from any willful breach of
any of its representations or warranties or the breach of any of its covenants
or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

                     SECTION 8.6 Termination Amount and Expenses.

                     (a) Except as set forth in this Section 8.6, all Expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.12.

                     (b) The Company agrees that, if the Company shall terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(a) or Parent shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(a) then the Company shall pay to Parent on or
before the Termination Payment Date, a termination fee in an amount equal to
$15,000,000 plus an additional amount determined in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule 8.6, for a total amount not to exceed $27,500,000 (the
"TERMINATION AMOUNT"). As used in this Agreement, "TERMINATION PAYMENT DATE"
shall mean the earlier to occur of: (i) the date that is one (1) year after the
Termination Date, or (ii) the date on which a Superior Proposal is consummated
by the Company, and if the Superior Proposal terminates without being
consummated, the Company shall pay with the Termination Amount interest thereon
at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum from the date of termination of the
Superior Proposal to the date of payment. For purposes of this Agreement the
"value" of consideration other than cash payable in a Superior Proposal shall be
the fair market value as determined in good faith by the Company Board for
purposes of valuing the Superior Proposal, except that any publicly-traded
security shall be valued as follows: (i) if the security is then traded on a
national securities exchange or Nasdaq (or a similar national quotation system),
then the value of the security shall be deemed to be the average of the closing
prices of the security on such exchange or system over the ten (10) trading day
period ending on the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.3(a) or 8.4(a) or (ii) if the security is actively traded over-the-counter,
then the value of the security shall be deemed to be the average of the
midpoints between the closing bid and asked prices of the security over the ten


                                       41
<PAGE>
(10) trading day period ending on the date this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 8.3(a) or 8.4(a).

                     (c) The Company agrees that, if Parent shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.4(b), the Company shall pay to Parent, within
five (5) business days of receipt by Company of a written notice from Parent
evidencing Parent's documented Expenses, an amount equal to Parent's documented
Expenses not to exceed $3,500,000 in the aggregate.

                     (d) Parent agrees that, if the Company shall terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.3(b), Parent shall pay to the Company, within
five (5) business days of receipt by Parent of a written notice from the Company
evidencing the Company's documented Expenses, an amount equal to the Company's
documented Expenses not to exceed $3,500,000 in the aggregate.

                     (e) Each of Parent and the Company agrees that the payments
provided for in this Section 8.6 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the
parties upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, and such
remedy shall be limited to the payments stipulated in this Section 8.6;
provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any party hereto
of any liability or damages resulting from any willful breach of any of its
representations and warranties or the breach of any of its covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
recovery by Parent under Section 8.6(b) or Section 8.6(c) is intended to be
mutually exclusive and in no event shall Parent be entitled to payment under
both such Sections.

                     (f) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 8.6 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, such party would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if a party fails to pay promptly amounts due
hereunder, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a
suit which results in a judgment against the Company for such amounts, the
non-prevailing party shall pay the prevailing party's expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with such suit.

                     (g) Any payment required to be made pursuant to this
Section 8.6 shall be made on the requisite payment date by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent or the Company,
as applicable.

                     SECTION 8.7 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by
action taken by the Company, Parent and Merger Sub at any time before or after
approval of the Merger by the Company Requisite Vote but, after any such
approval, no amendment shall be made which requires the approval of such
stockholders under applicable Law without such approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the parties
hereto.

                     SECTION 8.8 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, each party hereto (for these purposes, Parent and Merger Sub
shall together be deemed one party and the Company shall be deemed the other
party) may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations


                                       42
<PAGE>
and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance by the
other party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any
agreement on the part of either party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such party. The failure of either party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.


                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

None of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this
Agreement or in any exhibit, schedule or instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive beyond the Effective Time, except for those covenants
and agreements contained herein and therein that by their terms apply or are to
be performed in whole or in part after the Effective Time and this Article IX.
This Section 9.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties which
by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time.

                     SECTION 9.2 Entire Agreement; Assignment. (a) This
Agreement (including any exhibits, schedules and annexes to this Agreement), the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent Disclosure Schedule constitute the
entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all other prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof other
than the Confidentiality Agreement.

                     (b) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests
or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by operation of Law (including, but
not limited to, by merger or consolidation) or otherwise. Any assignment in
violation of the preceding sentence shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

                     SECTION 9.3 Notices. All notices, requests, instructions or
other documents to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall
be deemed given (a) five (5) business days following sending by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, (b) when sent if sent by facsimile; provided,
that the fax is promptly confirmed by telephone confirmation thereof, (c) when
