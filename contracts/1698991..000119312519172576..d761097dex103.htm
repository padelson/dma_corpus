illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">5.2 <U>Assignment</U>. Neither

unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money damages may be inadequate and the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-breaching</FONT> party may have no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, the
parties agree that such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-breaching</FONT> party shall have the right to enforce its rights and the other party&#146;s obligations hereunder by an action or actions for specific performance and/or injunctive relief
(without posting of bond or other security), including any order, injunction or decree sought by such <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-breaching</FONT> party to cause the other party to perform its/their respective agreements and covenants
contained in this Agreement and to cure breaches of this Agreement. Each party further agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any action for any such equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a breach
or threatened breach of this Agreement. </P>
