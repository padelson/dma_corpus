Exhibit 10.3

 

SUPPORT AGREEMENT

This SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
June 13, 2019, by and among TPG Pace Holdings Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted
company (" _Parent_ ") and Accel Entertainment, Inc., an Illinois corporation
(the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in the Transaction
Agreement (as defined below).

 

RECITALS

A. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent,
each of the Persons set forth on Schedule 1 to the Transaction Agreement (each
a " _Seller_ ", and collectively the " _Sellers_ "), and each of David
Ruttenberg and Gordon Rubenstein, each in their capacity as a Shareholder
Representative, are entering into a Transaction Agreement substantially in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (as the same may be amended from time to
time, the " _Transaction Agreement_ ") pursuant to which, among other things,
Parent shall acquire, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding Company Stock of the Company held by the Sellers (the "
_Stock Purchase_ "), and following the Closing, the Company shall merge with
and into New Pace LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _NewCo_ "), with NewCo surviving such merger (the "
_Merger_ ") (NewCo, in its capacity as surviving company of the Merger, is
sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving NewCo_ "), as a result of which,
Surviving NewCo will become a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. 

B. The Sellers are holders of Company Stock and, pursuant to the Transaction
Agreement and by virtue of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreement, each Seller will directly or indirectly receive substantial payment
and other valuable consideration from Parent in exchange for Company Stock as
specified in the Transaction Agreement, and the Company desires to assist the
Sellers to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Agreement and realize such valuable consideration by entering into this
Agreement.

 

C. Each of Parent and the Company has determined that it is in its best
interests to enter into this Agreement.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below and for
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, do
hereby agree as follows:

 

1\. _Support_. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Sellers in their compliance with the covenants as set forth in
Articles I, II, IV and V of the Transaction Agreement.

2\. _Expense Reimbursement_.

 

2.1 _Agreement to Pay Parent Expense Reimbursement_. Notwithstanding Section
7.3(a) of the Transaction Agreement, in the event that (a) there is a valid
termination of the Transaction Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section
7.1(b)(iii) of the Transaction Agreement, or (b) there is a valid termination
of the Transaction Agreement by the Shareholder Representatives pursuant to
Section 7.1(b)(ii) of the Transaction Agreement and Parent may have validly
terminated the Transaction Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) of the
Transaction Agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent an
expense reimbursement fee equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Parent
Transaction Expenses documented and actually incurred by Parent and its
Affiliates up to a maximum amount of $1,000,000 (the " _Parent Expense
Reimbursement_ ").

   

2.2 _Agreement to Pay Company Expense Reimbursement_. Notwithstanding Section
7.3(a) of the Transaction Agreement, in the event that there is a valid
termination of the Transaction Agreement either (x) by (i) the Shareholder
Representatives pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) of the Transaction
Agreement, or (ii) either the Shareholder Representatives or Parent for any
reason and the Shareholder Representatives may have validly terminated this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)(iii) of the Transaction Agreement then
Parent shall pay an expense reimbursement equal to one hundred percent (100%)
of the Company Transaction Expenses documented and actually incurred by the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates up to a maximum
amount of $1,000,000, or (y) by (i) the Shareholder Representatives pursuant
to Section 7.1(c) of the Transaction Agreement, or (ii) either the Shareholder
Representatives or Parent for any reason and the Shareholder Representatives
may have validly terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) of the
Transaction Agreement, then Parent shall pay an expense reimbursement equal to
one hundred percent (100%) of the Company Transaction Expenses documented and
actually incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates up to a maximum amount of $3,000,000 (such payment pursuant to
either _clause (x)_ or _(y)_ , the " _Company Expense Reimbursement_ " and
each of the Company Expense Reimbursement and the Parent Expense
Reimbursement, an " _Expense Reimbursement_ "); _provided_ , that Parent shall
not be required to pay the Company Expense Reimbursement pursuant to _clause
(y)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_ if the Company has failed to use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the Companys audit which is being
undertaken in connection with the filing of the S-4 Registration Statement /
Proxy Statement to be completed as soon as possible, or (ii) assist Parent in
the preparation and filing of the S-4 Registration Statement / Proxy
Statement.

 

2.3 _Terms of Payment of Expense Reimbursement_. The applicable Expense
Reimbursement shall be paid within ten (10) Business Days after the party
required to pay such Expense Reimbursement receives the documented Company
Transaction Expenses or Parent Transaction Expenses, as applicable, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by
the party entitled to receive such Expense Reimbursement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Transaction Agreement (other than Section
5.6(f) thereof), the parties expressly acknowledge and agree that, with
respect to any termination of the Transaction Agreement in circumstances
where an Expense Reimbursement is payable, the payment of the Expense
Reimbursement shall, in light of the difficulty of accurately determining
actual damages, constitute liquidated damages with respect to any claim for
damages or any other claim which the recipient(s) of the Expense Reimbursement
would otherwise be entitled to assert against the liable party or its
Affiliates or any of their respective assets, or against any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or shareholders with respect to the
Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby and shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy available to such parties. Except for
nonpayment of the Expense Reimbursement (and as set forth in Section 5.6(f)
of the Transaction Agreement), the parties hereby agree that, upon termination
of the Transaction Agreement in circumstances where the Expense Reimbursement
is payable, in no event shall the other parties (a) seek to obtain any
recovery or judgment against the party liable for the Expense Reimbursement or
its Affiliates or any of their respective assets, or against any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or shareholders or (b) be entitled
to seek or obtain any other damages of any kind, including consequential,
indirect or punitive damages; _provided_ , that, the foregoing shall not (i)
relieve any party from liability for Actual Fraud prior to termination of the
Transaction Agreement or (ii) limit the right of any party to seek specific
performance or other injunctive relief in lieu of terminating the Transaction
Agreement.

3\. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate, and no party shall have any
rights or obligations hereunder and this Agreement shall have no further
effect upon (i) the mutual agreement of the parties hereto, or (ii) the
termination of the Transaction Agreement in accordance with its terms. No such
termination, however, shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or
damages to the other party hereto resulting from any deliberate breach of this
Agreement prior to its termination.

 

4\. _Litigation_. Subject to the following sentence, each party hereto shall
notify the other party hereto of the defense, settlement or prosecution of
any proceeding commenced following the date hereof related to this Agreement
or the Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and shall keep the other party hereto apprised of any developments
with respect to such defense, settlement or prosecution, on a reasonably
frequent basis and at such partys sole cost and expense. Further, to the
extent that the Company becomes aware of any Action brought by any shareholder
of the Company against the Company or its directors or officers relating to
this Agreement or the Transaction Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Transaction Agreement, the Company shall promptly
advise Parent orally and in writing of such Action and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed regarding any such litigation. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in, subject to a customary joint defense
agreement, but not control the defense of any such litigation, shall give due
consideration to Parents advice with respect to such litigation, and shall
not settle any such litigation without the prior written consent of Parent,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

5\. _Miscellaneous_.

5.1  _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is not affected
in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement
so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

5.2 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ shall be void. 

5.3 _Amendment; Modification_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented at any time only by written agreement of the parties.

5.4 _Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief_. The parties acknowledge that
the rights of each party set forth herein are unique and recognize and affirm
that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any party, money damages
may be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy at
law. Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party shall have
the right to enforce its rights and the other partys obligations hereunder by
an action or actions for specific performance and/or injunctive
relief (without posting of bond or other security), including any order,
injunction or decree sought by such non-breaching party to cause the other
party to perform its/their respective agreements and covenants contained in
this Agreement and to cure breaches of this Agreement. Each party further
agrees that the only permitted objection that it may raise in response to any
action for any such equitable relief is that it contests the existence of a
breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

5.6 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware (regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof) as to all matters, including matters of validity,
construction, effect, performance and remedies.

 

5.7 _Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process_. Each party hereby and
any person asserting rights as a third party beneficiary may do so only if
he, she or it irrevocably agrees that any Action shall be brought only to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware or the federal
courts located in the State of Delaware, and each party hereby consents to
the jurisdiction of such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such suit, action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action or
proceeding in any such court or that any such suit, action or proceeding that
is brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. During
the period an Action that is filed in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
5.7_ is pending before a court, all actions, suits or proceedings with respect
to such Action or any other Action, including any counterclaim, cross-claim or
interpleader, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court.
Each party and any person asserting rights as a third party beneficiary may do
so only if he, she or it hereby waives, and shall not assert as a defense in
any Action, that (a) such party is not personally subject to the jurisdiction
of the above named courts for any reason, (b) such action, suit or proceeding
may not be brought or is not maintainable in such court, (c) such partys
property is exempt or immune from execution, (d) such action, suit or
proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or (e) the venue of such
action, suit or proceeding is improper. A final judgment in any action, suit
or proceeding described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ following the expiration
of any period permitted for appeal and subject to any stay during appeal shall
be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Laws. EACH OF
THE PARTIES AND ANY PERSON ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY MAY
DO SO ONLY IF HE, SHE OR IT IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY ON ANY CLAIMS OR COUNTERCLAIMS ASSERTED IN ANY ACTION
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND FOR
ANY COUNTERCLAIM RELATING THERETO. IF THE SUBJECT MATTER OF ANY SUCH ACTION IS
ONE IN WHICH THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL IS PROHIBITED, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON
ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL ASSERT IN SUCH ACTION A
NONCOMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. FURTHERMORE, NO PARTY NOR ANY PERSON
ASSERTING RIGHTS AS A THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY SHALL SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY
SUCH ACTION WITH A SEPARATE ACTION OR OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY
TRIAL CANNOT BE WAIVED.

5.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, this Agreement is exclusively for the benefit of Parent, and its
respective successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the obligations
of the Company under this Agreement, and for the benefit of the Company, and
its respective successors and permitted assigns, with respect to the
obligations of Parent under this Agreement, and this Agreement shall not be
deemed to confer upon or give to any other third party any remedy, claim,
liability, reimbursement, cause of action or other right.

counterparts with the same effect as if the signatures to each counterpart

5.12 _Headings_. The Section headings contained in this Agreement are
