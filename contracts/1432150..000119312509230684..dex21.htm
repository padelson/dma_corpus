procedures as it deems to be reasonably necessary to permit the holders of
any outstanding Company Warrants to elect to:

A. If the Company Warrant is for the purchase of Series BB Preferred Stock
and if the Exercise Price is less than $3.2745 per share, effect a net
exercise of such Company Warrant immediately prior to the Closing and thereby

12 2.5 _Surrender of Certificates_. Within five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Series AA
Preferred Stock or Series BB Preferred Stock (the "Certificates") a letter of
transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") in customary form (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to Parent and
shall contain such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably
specify). Upon receipt of the Certificates for cancellation, together with a
duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and any other
documents as Parent shall reasonably require, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to promptly deliver to such Company Stockholder that portion of the
Merger Consideration which such Company Stockholder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ and any other amount which such Company
Stockholder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_. In the
event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent, as promptly as practicable following the receipt by the Exchange Agent
and Parent of the foregoing documents, to issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate that portion of the Merger Consideration and
any other amount payable pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ represented by the
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in exchange therefor which the Company
Stockholder has the right to receive. The Board of Directors of Parent may in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to provide to Parent
an indemnity agreement against any claim that may be made against Parent with
respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
From and after the Effective Time, no shares of Company Capital Stock will
be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of Certificates formerly
representing such Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto except as provided herein or by Applicable Law. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed and no
transfer of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Capital
Stock are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for that portion of the Merger Consideration and any
other amount payable with respect to such Company Capital Stock in accordance
with _Section 2.1(c)_.

2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. If, in connection with the Merger, holders of Company
Capital Stock shall have demanded and perfected appraisal rights pursuant to
_Section 262_ of Delaware Law, none of such Dissenting Shares shall be
converted into a right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration or any
other amount payable with respect to such Company Capital Stock in accordance
with _Section 2.1(c)_, but shall be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to Delaware Law. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who,
pursuant to the provisions of Delaware Law becomes entitled to payment of the
fair value of such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with
Delaware Law (but only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or
finally determined pursuant to Delaware Law). In the event that any holder of
Company Capital Stock fails to make an effective demand for payment or fails
to perfect its appraisal rights as to its shares of Company Capital Stock or
any Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose their status as Dissenting Shares,
then any such shares shall immediately be converted into the right to receive
the consideration issuable pursuant to _Article II_ in respect of



 

13  such shares as if such shares never been Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall
issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably
practicable after) the applicable time or times specified in _Section 2.5_,
following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in _Section
2.5_, the portion of the Merger Consideration and any other amounts, to which
such Company Stockholder would have been entitled under _Section 2.1(c)_
with respect to such shares. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice
of any demand received by the Company for appraisal of Company Capital Stock
in accordance with Delaware Law and (ii) the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal rights
under such law. The Company agrees that, except with Parents prior written
consent, it shall not voluntarily make any payment or offer to make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand for
appraisal rights.

2.7  _Legends; Stop-Transfer Notices; Removal_.

(a) _Legends_. Legends reading substantially as follows shall be placed on
each stock certificate representing Parent Common Shares issued pursuant to
the Merger:

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED FOR
INVESTMENT AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933. SUCH
SHARES MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
REGISTRATION WITHOUT AN EXEMPTION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT AND AN OPINION OF
LEGAL COUNSEL REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS
NOT REQUIRED.

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO A LOCK-UP
PERIOD AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE ISSUERS REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED

issued in the Merger (the "Merger Securities") agrees that, in order to ensure
compliance with the restrictions referred to herein, Parent may issue
appropriate "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent.

of _Section 7.5_; and (ii) the expiration or termination of the market stand-
off provisions of _Section 7.1_ (and of any agreement entered pursuant to
_Section 7.1_. After such time, and upon the request of such Holder of Merger
Securities, a new certificate or certificates representing such Parent Common
Stock not repurchased shall be issued without the legends referred to in
_Section 2.7(a)_, and delivered to such Holder.



 

14 2.8 _Tax Withholding_. Parent or Parents agent (the "Payer") shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration or other payment
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company Securityholder,
the amounts it reasonably determines are required to be deducted and withheld
under the Code, the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance [New Version], 1961, as
amended (the "Ordinance") or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law
with respect to the making of such payment, provided, however, that (i)
with respect to Israeli entities or residents only; it is being agreed that
no withholding with respect to Israeli Taxes will be made for Company
Securityholders that are non-Israeli entities or individuals if such holder
represents, to the Payers satisfaction, that such holder is not an Israeli
resident for Israeli tax purposes and if being a body of persons represents
that it was not formed or organized under the laws of the State of Israel and
is not managed and controlled from Israel, and in addition in the case of an
LLC, partnership or any other passthrough entity formed or organized outside
the State of Israel that all its capital interest holders are non-Israeli
residents (the "Residency Certificate"), or (ii) in the event that any
Company Securityholder provides the Payer at least three Business Days prior
to the last day on which the amounts so withheld, if withheld, must be
transferred to the applicable authority, with a valid approval or ruling
issued by the applicable Governmental Authority regarding the withholding (or
exemption from withholding) of Israeli Tax from the Merger Consideration in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Payer (with respect to Israeli
withholding requirements a valid certificate of exemption from withholding
with respect to services and assets or a ruling issued by the Israeli tax
authority will be sufficient), then the deduction and withholding of any
amounts under the Ordinance or any other provision of Israeli law or
requirement, if any, from the Merger Consideration payable to such Company
Securityholder shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such
approval or ruling. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Company Securityholder in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made. If the Payer so withholds amounts and pays them to
applicable authorities, the Payer shall furnish to such Company
Securityholder documents evidencing such withholding.

2.9 _Tax and Accounting Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto
that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368 of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan
of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3T(a)
of the United States Income Tax Regulations. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, Merger Sub or Company makes any representation or warranty
with respect to any tax consequences to Parent, Merger Sub, Company or any
Company Stockholders arising under this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, and each party hereto and the Company Stockholders shall
rely on their own tax advisors as to the tax consequences to them of such
transactions.

2.10 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time before or after the
Effective Time, any of the parties hereto reasonably believes or is advised
that any further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably
necessary to consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of
this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective officers and directors shall
execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments, instruments and
assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary to consummate the

Person. In the conduct of its business, including without limitation the

technology, software or other copyrightable, patentable or otherwise
proprietary work. To the Companys knowledge, neither the employment of any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor the use by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries of the services of any consultant or independent

Subsidiaries).

(f) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has taken commercially reasonable

the use, priority or enforceability of the trademark or service mark. To the
knowledge of the Company, the Company, each of its Subsidiaries, and each of

be required to deposit, with an escrow agent or other party, any Company

any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") or the
Department of Labor ("DOL"). No "prohibited transaction" (as defined in
_Section 4975_ of the Code or _Section 406_ of ERISA) has occurred that
involves the assets of any Company Benefit Arrangements and that is
reasonably likely to subject Company, any of the its Subsidiaries, or any of
their employees to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
_Section 4975_ of the Code or the sanctions imposed under Title I of ERISA.

(g) All contributions due from the Company with respect to any of the Company
Benefit Arrangements have been made or have been accrued on the Companys
financial statements (including the Company Financial Statements), and no
further contributions shall be due or shall have accrued thereunder as of the
Closing Date (other than contributions accrued in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practices, after the Balance Sheet Date as a
result of the operations of the Company after the Balance Sheet Date).

(h) All individuals who, pursuant to the terms of any Company Benefit
Arrangement, are entitled to participate in any Company Benefit Arrangement,
are currently participating in such Company Benefit Arrangement or have been
offered an opportunity to do so and have declined to do so.

(i) The Company shall not have any material Liability to any employee or to
any organization or any other entity as a result of the termination of any
employee leasing arrangement.



 

39 (j) There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement
(whether or not written) by the Company relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Arrangement that would
increase materially the expense of maintaining such Company Benefit
Arrangement above the level of the expense incurred in respect thereof during
the calendar year 2008 (other than increased insurance premiums), except any
such amendments that are required under Applicable Law. Except as set forth on
_Section 3.16(j)_ to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the execution of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not (either alone or in connection with the termination of
employment or change of position of any employee following or in connection
with the consummation of the Merger) constitute an event under any Company
Benefit Arrangement that will or may result in any material payment (whether
severance pay or otherwise), acceleration of payment, forgiveness of
indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any employee.

(k) Each Company Benefit Arrangement and each group health plan maintained by
an ERISA Affiliate, to the extent applicable, is in compliance, in all
material respects, with applicable state and federal laws including the
continuation coverage requirements of  _Section 4980B_ of the Code,
_Sections 601_ through 608 of ERISA, the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990, as amended, and the regulations thereunder, the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations
thereunder, the Womens Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, and the Family
Medical Leave Act of 1993, as amended, and the regulations thereunder, as such
requirements affect the Company, any Subsidiary, and their employees. There
are no outstanding, uncorrected violations under the Consolidation Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, ("COBRA"), with respect to any
of the Company Benefit Arrangements, covered employees or qualified
beneficiaries that would be reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Parent.

(l) Except as set forth on _Section 3.16(l)_ to the Company Disclosure
Schedule, no benefit payable or that may become payable by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Company Benefit Arrangement or as a
result of, in connection with or arising under this Agreement or the
Certificate of Merger shall constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in
_Section 280G(b)(2)_ of the Code) that is subject to the imposition of an
excise tax under _Section 4999_ of the Code or that would not be deductible
by reason of _Section 280G_ of the Code. Unless otherwise indicated in
_Section 3.16(l)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries is not a party to any: (i) Contract with any executive
officer or other key employee thereof (A) the benefits of which are
contingent, or the terms of which are materially altered, upon the occurrence
of a transaction involving the Company in the nature of the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Company Ancillary
Agreement, (B) providing any term of employment or compensation guarantee,
or (C) providing severance benefits or other benefits after the termination
of employment of such employee regardless of the reason for such termination
of employment other than as required by COBRA (or similar state laws),
vacation pay cash-outs or other arrangements governed by ERISA; or (ii)
Contract or plan, including any stock option plan, stock appreciation rights
plan or stock purchase plan, any of the benefits of which shall be increased,
or the vesting of benefits of which shall be accelerated, by the occurrence
of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or 



 

40  any event subsequent to the Merger such as the termination of employment of
any person, or the value of any of the benefits of which shall be calculated
on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries has no obligation to pay any material
amount or provide any material benefit to any former employee or officer,
other than obligations (i) for which the Company has established a reserve
for such amount on the Company Balance Sheet, (ii) pursuant to Contracts
entered into after the Balance Sheet Date and disclosed on _Section 3.16(l)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (iii) governmentally mandated
benefits.

(m) To the Companys knowledge, no employee or consultant of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is in material violation of (i) any term of any
employment or consulting Contract or (ii) any term of any other Contract or
any restrictive covenant relating to the right of any such employee or
consultant to be employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to use
trade secrets or proprietary information of others. To the Companys
knowledge, the employment of any employee or consultant by the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries does not subject it to any Liability to any third
party other than Liabilities with respect to employer payroll tax and employee
tax withholding.

(n) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has not established any
compensation and benefit plan that is maintained or is required to be
maintained or contributed to by the law or applicable custom or rule of the
relevant jurisdiction, outside of the United States.

loss," or "plant closing" as defined by the Workers Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act (the "WARN Act") in respect of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(p) All required reports and descriptions of each Company Benefit Arrangement
(including Internal Revenue Service Form 5500 annual reports, summary annual
reports, summary plan descriptions and summaries of material modifications)
have been timely filed with the IRS, the DOL or other governmental body and
have been distributed as required.

(q) The form of each Company Benefit Arrangement that is subject to _Section
409A_ of the Code meets the requirements of  _Sections 409A(a)(2)_, _(3)_
and _(4)_ of the Code and has been operated in accordance with such
requirements.

respect to employees of the Company who reside or work in Israel (the "
_Israeli Employees_ "): (i) the employment of each Israeli Employee is
subject to termination upon not more than thirty (30) days prior written
notice under the termination notice provisions included in the applicable
employment agreement with such Israeli Employee disclosed on _3.16(r) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ or Applicable Law; (ii) all obligations of the
Company to provide statutory severance pay to all Israeli Employees pursuant
to the Severance Pay Law (5723-1963) are fully funded or are accrued on the
Company Financial Statements; (iii) no Israeli Employees employment by the
Company requires any special license, permit or other governmental
authorization; (iv) there are no unwritten policies, practices or customs
of the Company that entitle any Israeli Employee to benefits in addition to
what such Israeli Employee is entitled to 



 

41  by Applicable Law or under the terms of such Israeli Employees employment
agreement (including unwritten customs or practices concerning bonuses, the
payment of statutory severance pay when it is not required under Applicable
Law); (v) all amounts that the Company is legally or contractually required
either (x) to deduct from Israeli Employees salaries or to transfer to such

obligations to make any such deduction, transfer, withholding or
payment; (vi) the Company is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Law and Contracts relating to employment, employment practices,

Law, 1996; and (vii) the Company has not engaged any consultants, sub-

is not subject to, and no employee benefits from, any expansion order (tzavei
harchava) except for extension orders applying to all employees in the State
of Israel. The Company has furnished to Parent (a) copies of all agreements
with Israeli Employees, agreements with Israeli human resource contractors, or
with Israeli consultants, sub-contractors or freelancers; (b) copies

policies of insurance and bonds set forth in _Section 3.18_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, including all legally required workers compensation and
other insurance. _Section 3.18_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth
the name of the insurer under each such policy and bond, the type of policy
or bond, and the coverage amount and any applicable deductible. There is no
material claim pending under any of such policies or bonds as to which
coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the underwriters of such
policies or bonds. All premiums due and payable under all such policies and
bonds have been timely paid, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is
otherwise in compliance in all material respects with the terms of such
policies and bonds. All such policies and bonds remain in full force and
effect, and the Company has no



 

42  knowledge of any threatened termination of, or material premium increase

insurance coverage for the Companys or its Subsidiaries assets and operation
of the Company Business, of the kinds, in the amounts and against the risks
required to comply with Applicable Law and/or any contractual or other
obligations, and such policies are of the scope and amount customary and
reasonable for the businesses in which the Company and its Subsidiaries has
engaged. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been refused any
insurance with respect to any aspect of the operations of its business, nor
has its coverage been limited by any insurance carrier to which it has
applied for insurance or with which it has carried insurance. The activities
and operations of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have been conducted
in a manner so as to materially conform to all applicable provisions of such

liabilities or obligations excluded under (a) through (c) above).

taken as a whole.

Sub.

issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, and will not be subject to any right
of rescission, right of first refusal or preemptive right, and will be
offered, issued, sold and delivered by the Parent in compliance with
all requirements of Applicable Law.

4.13 _Reorganization_. None of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries (including
Merger Sub) nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any of Parents Affiliates has
taken or agreed to take any action that would prevent the Merger from
qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code
and Parent is not aware of any agreement, plan or other circumstance that
would prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

the time of Parents follow-on offering and ending 180 days from the effective
date of such registration statement, subject to such extension or extensions
as may be required by the underwriters in order to publish research reports
while complying with Rule 2711 of the National Association of Security
Dealers, Inc. and Rule 472(f)(4) of the New York Stock Exchange (the "Lock-Up
Period"); provided, however, that upon 90 days after the effective date of
such registration statement and upon the consent of the underwriters, the
parties subject to the Lock-Up Period shall be permitted to sell or otherwise
dispose of 5% of the Merger Securities or Management Securities,
as applicable, on a pro rata basis; and provided further that the parties
subject to the Lock-Up Period shall be permitted to sell or otherwise dispose
of 2.5% of the Merger Securities or Management Securities, as applicable,
every two weeks thereafter on a pro rata basis; with both of such provisos
subject to the consent of such underwriters, only in attempt to provide the
best conditions for the success of such public offering. For purposes of
clarification, no more than one such extension of the Lock-Up Period may
occur. For the purposes of this section, the pro rata percentage shall be
calculated as the sum of (i) the number of shares of Merger Securities or
Management Securities held by the Holder or the member of the Management, as
applicable, divided by (ii) the number of shares of Merger Securities or
Management Securities held by all Holders and the Management subject to the
Lock-up Period. The Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the
Chief Accounting Officer of the Parent will notify the Holders and the
Management regarding the number of pro rata shares that such Holders and
Management are permitted to sell. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (A) the
Parent does not file the registration statement within 90 days after the
Effective Time or (B) the Parent files the registration statement and the SEC
has not declared the registration effective within one-hundred fifty (150)
days of the initial filing, the provisions and restrictions under this
Section 7.1 shall have no force or effect.

(b) _Limitations_. The obligations described in _Section 7.1(a)_ shall not
apply to: (i) a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans, or to
a registration relating solely to a transaction pursuant to Rule 145 under the
Securities Act; (ii) shares of Parent Common Stock acquired by a Holder
directly from the underwriters in a registered public offering of Parents
securities; or (iii) shares of Parent Common Stock acquired by a Holder in an
established trading market from any party other than Parent.



 

60 7.2 _Approval of the Company Stockholders_. Company shall promptly after the
date hereof take all action necessary in accordance with Delaware Law and the
Company Charter Documents to obtain the Stockholder Approvals approving the
Merger as soon as practicable.

7.3 _Sale of Shares Pursuant to Regulation D_. The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to the holders of
the Series AA Preferred Stock and Series BB Preferred Stock and the holders of
Company Warrants pursuant to _Section 2.1_ hereof shall constitute
"restricted securities" under the Securities Act. All such holders shall be
accredited investors. The certificates of Parent Common Stock shall bear the
legend set forth in _Section 2.7_. It is acknowledged and understood that
Parent is relying on certain written representations made by each holder of
Series AA Preferred Stock, Series BB Preferred Stock and Company Warrants.
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each holder of
Series AA Preferred Stock, Series BB Preferred Stock and Company Warrants to
execute and deliver to Parent an Investor Representation Statement in the
form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the "Investor Representation Statement")
prior to the Closing Date.

7.4 _Blue Sky Laws_. Parent shall take such steps as may be necessary to
comply with the securities and blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are
applicable to the issuance of the Parent Common Stock in connection with the
Merger. Company shall take such steps as may be necessary to assist Parent as
may be necessary to comply with the securities and blue sky laws of all
jurisdictions which are applicable in connection with the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

7.5 _Registration of Shares of Parent Common Stock Issued in the Merger_.

(a) Parent shall cause the Merger Securities to be registered under the
Securities Act so as to permit the resale thereof, and in connection therewith
shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file a
registration statement under the Securities Act (the "Registration
Statement") with the SEC by December 9, 2009 and use all commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to become effective as
soon as possible after the filing thereof, and in any event shall cause the
Registration Statement to become effective within four (4) months after the
Effective Time. Each Holder shall provide all such information and materials
to Parent and take all such action as may be required in order to permit
Parent to comply with all applicable requirements of the SEC and to obtain
any desired acceleration of the effective date of such Registration Statement.
Such provision of information and materials is a condition precedent to the
obligations of Parent with respect to such Holder pursuant to this _Section
7.5_. The offering made pursuant to such registration shall not be
underwritten.

(b) Parent shall (i) prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement
in accordance with _Section 7.5(a)_ hereof with respect to the shares of
Merger Securities and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement to remain effective for a period ending on the
first to occur of (a) the date all of the shares registered thereunder and 



 

61  not previously sold by the Holders may be sold under Rule 144 in one three-
month period (assuming compliance by the Holders and Parent with the
provisions thereof) or (B) two (2) years after the Effective Time; _provided_
, _however_ , for this subsection (B), if the Parent exercises its Suspension
Right (as defined below), the period for the effective time of the
Registration Statement shall be extended beyond the two (2) years by the
cumulative period of time in which the Parent has suspended open market offers
and sales of Merger Securities; (ii) prepare and file with the SEC such
amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement and the prospectus
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to comply with the provisions
of the Securities Act with respect to the sale or other disposition of all
securities proposed to be registered in the Registration Statement until
the termination of effectiveness of the Registration Statement; and (iii)
furnish to each Holder such number of copies of any prospectus (including any
amended or supplemented prospectus) in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act, and such other documents, as each Holder may reasonably
request in order to effect the offering and sale of the Merger Securities to
be offered and sold, but only while Parent shall be required under the
provisions hereof to cause the Registration Statement to remain current.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 7.5_, Parent shall
have the right at any time to require that all Holders suspend further open
market offers and sales of Merger Securities for a period not to exceed ninety
(90) days, if, in the reasonable judgment of Parent after consultation with
counsel, there is in existence material undisclosed information or events
with respect to Parent the disclosure of which would be seriously detrimental
to Parent (the "Suspension Right"); provided, however, that Parent shall not
exercise this Suspension Right more than once in any twelve (12) month
period. In the event Parent exercises the Suspension Right, such suspension
will continue for the period of time reasonably necessary for disclosure to
occur at a time that is not materially detrimental to Parent or until such
time as the information or event is no longer material, each as determined in
good faith by Parent after consultation with counsel, but in no event shall
any single suspension continue for more than 90 consecutive days. Parent will
promptly give notice, in a writing signed by an executive officer of Parent of
any such suspension (the "Suspension Notice"). Parent agrees to notify the
Holders promptly upon termination of the suspension (the "Resumption
Notice").

(d) Parent shall pay all of the out-of-pocket expenses, other than
underwriting discounts and commissions, if any, incurred in connection with
any registration of Merger Securities pursuant to this _Section 7.5_,
including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, printing
expenses, transfer agents and registrars fees, the fees and disbursements
of Parents outside counsel and independent accountants and the reasonable
fees and disbursements of one counsel for the selling Holders selected by them
with the approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

(e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, Parent will indemnify,
defend, protect and hold harmless each selling Holder, each underwriter of
Parent Common Stock being sold by such Holders pursuant to this _Section
7.5_, each Person, if any, who controls any such Holder or underwriter within
the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and their respective
affiliates, officers, directors, partners, successors and assigns (each a
"Holder Indemnitee") against all actions, claims, losses, damages, liabilities
and expenses to which they or any of them become subject under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or under any other statute or at common law or otherwise
and, except as hereinafter provided, will promptly 



 

62  reimburse each such Holder Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them or any of them in connection with investigating or
defending any actions, whether or not resulting in any liability, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities or actions arise out of or
are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of material
fact in any Registration Statement and any prospectus filed pursuant to
_Section 7.5_ or any post-effective amendment thereto or arise out of or are
based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or any violation by Parent of any rule or regulation promulgated
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or under any other statute or at
common law or otherwise and relating to action or inaction required of Parent
in connection with such registration; provided, however, that Parent shall
not be liable to any such Holder Indemnitee in respect of any claims, losses,
damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission, made in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished to Parent by such Holder
Indemnitee specifically for use in connection with such registration statement
and prospectus or post-effective amendment.

 

(f) To the fullest extent permitted by law, each selling Holder of Merger
Securities registered in accordance with  _Section 7.5_ will indemnify
Parent, each Person, if any, who controls Parent within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, each underwriter of Parent Common Stock
and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, partners, successors
and assigns (each a "Parent Indemnitee") against any actions, claims, losses,
damages, liabilities and expenses to which they or any of them become subject
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or under any other statute or at
common law or otherwise, and, except as hereinafter provided, will promptly
reimburse each Parent Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them or any of them in connection with investigating or
defending any actions, whether or not resulting in any liability, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities or actions arise out of or
are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact in any Registration Statement and any prospectus filed pursuant to
_Section 7.5_ or any post-effective amendment thereto or arise out of or are
based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, which untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to Parent by such Holder specifically for use in
connection with such registration statement, prospectus or post-effective
amendment; provided, however, that the obligations of each such selling Holder
hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the proceeds to such Holder
from the sale of such Holders Merger Securities as contemplated herein.

(g) Each Person entitled to indemnification under this  _Section 7.5_ (a
"Registration Indemnified Person") shall give notice to the party required to
provide indemnification (the "Registration Indemnifying Person") promptly
after such Registration Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of any claim
as to which indemnity may be sought and shall permit the Registration
Indemnifying Person to assume the defense of any such claim and any litigation
resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the Registration Indemnifying
Person who conducts the defense of such claim or any litigation resulting
therefrom shall be approved by the Registration Indemnified Person (whose
approval shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the
Registration Indemnified Person may participate in such defense at such 



 

63  partys expense (unless the Registration Indemnified Person has reasonably
concluded that there may be a conflict of interest between the Registration
Indemnifying Person and the Registration Indemnified Person in such action,
in which case the fees and expenses of one counsel for such Registration
Indemnified Person(s) shall be at the expense of the Registration Indemnifying
Person), and provided further that the failure of any Registration
Indemnified Person to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Registration Indemnifying Person of its obligations under this _Section 7.5_
except to the extent the Registration Indemnifying Person is materially
prejudiced thereby. No Registration Indemnifying Person, in the defense of any
such claim or litigation, shall (except with the consent of each Registration
Indemnified Person) consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such Registration Indemnified Person of a
release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation. Each
Registration Indemnified Person shall furnish such information regarding
itself or the claim in question as a Registration Indemnifying Person may
reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in
connection with the defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.

(h) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability
under the Securities Act in any case in which Parent or any Holder makes a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section 7.5_ but it is judicially
determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent
jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last
right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case
notwithstanding that this _Section 7.5_ provides for indemnification, in such
case, then Parent and such Holder will contribute to the aggregate losses,
claims, damages or liabilities to which they may be subject (after
contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of Parent on the one hand and of the Holder on the other
in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations or, if the allocation provided herein is not permitted by
applicable law, in such proportion as shall be permitted by applicable law
and reflect as nearly as possible the allocation provided herein. The relative
fault of Parent on the one hand and of the Holder on the other shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by Parent on the one hand or by
the Holder on the other, and each partys relative intent, knowledge, access
to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission; provided, however, that in any such case (i) no Holder will be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the proceeds received by such
Holder from the sale of Merger Securities pursuant to the Registration
Statement; and (ii) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation within
the meaning of _Section 11(f)_ of the Securities Act will be entitled
to contribution from any Person or entity who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

(i) In no event shall Parent provide registration rights to any other Person
superior to or on parity with the rights provided in this _Section 7.5_.

7.6 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) The Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill
and honor the obligation of the Company to the Companys present and former
directors and officers (the " _Indemnified Directors and Officers_ ") pursuant
to the terms of the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.



 

64 (b) Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Agreement, this _Section
7.6_ (i) shall survive the consummation of the Merger, (ii) is intended to
benefit the Indemnified Directors and Officers and their respective heirs and
(iii) is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights
to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have against the
Parent or the Surviving Corporation first arising after the Closing Date by
contract or otherwise. This _Section 7.6_ shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified
Director and Officer under this _Section 7.6_ without the written consent of
such affected Indemnified Director and Officer.

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
neither the Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall take any action to
terminate any liability insurance that the Company acquires and fully pays for
prior to the Effective Time with respect to claims arising against the
Companys officers and directors with respect to their acts and omissions
as directors and officers of the Company occurring prior to the Effective
Time (the "Tail Policy"); provided that the Surviving Corporation may, but
under no circumstances shall be obligated to, substitute a policy of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions that, in the aggregate, are
no less advantageous. The Company shall purchase the Tail Policy, which for
clarity, would constitute a Merger Expense.

7.7 _Employees_. Immediately after the Effective Time, and for such period of
time as it determines in its sole discretion, Surviving Corporation shall
continue the at-will employment of such of the Companys employees as it
determines on terms and conditions commensurate with similarly situated
employees of Parent or Parents Affiliates. Such employees who are employed
by Surviving Corporation shall receive credit for service with the Company and
its Subsidiaries (including credit with predecessors recognized by the Company
and its Subsidiaries) for purposes of all employee benefit plans and programs
offered by the Company, including but not limited to paid time off. Prior to
the Closing, the Company shall take all required corporate action to terminate
the Companys 401(k) plan, and shall communicate the fact of
such terminations to all such employees. Prior to the Closing, the Company
shall communicate to those Company employees in the U.S. that are continuing
as employees in the U.S. of the Surviving Corporation that the Companys
current verbal policy of providing severance and COBRA benefits upon
termination will no longer be applicable; provided, however, the foregoing
shall not apply to any non-U.S. employees or any employee with an existing
contract providing for severance payments as of the Agreement Date. After the
Effective Time and upon the availability of shares under the Parent Option
Plans which can be issued in accordance with all applicable securities and
other laws and regulations, Parent shall grant to each of the employees of
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries a stock option award or other
equity award with respect to Parent stock with terms and conditions and for
numbers of shares that are consistent with stock option awards or other equity
awards to other similarly situated employees of Parent or Parents
Affiliates; subsequent awards to such employees shall be as determined in the
sole discretion of Parent. The employment of the current Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company shall terminate at the
Effective Time, and such individuals shall not become employees of Surviving
Corporation or any of its Affiliates. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer of the Company and those other individuals set forth on
_Schedule 7.7_ attached hereto shall receive such COBRA benefits set forth
opposite their names on _Schedule 7.7_ which shall be paid for by the Parent.



 

65 7.8 _Reorganization_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intends and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify
and will not take any actions which to its knowledge could reasonably be
expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within
the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Unless otherwise required pursuant to
a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall report the Merger as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code.

$1,500,000.

ARTICLE IX  

TERMINATION OF AGREEMENT

9.1 _Termination by Mutual Consent_. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Effective Time by the mutual written consent of Parent and
the Company.

9.2 _Unilateral Termination_.

(a) Either Parent or the Company, by giving written notice to the other, may
terminate this Agreement if a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree
or ruling or taken any other action, in each case having the effect of
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger or any
other material transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Either Parent or the Company, by giving written notice to the other, may
terminate this Agreement if the Merger shall not have been consummated by
midnight in Palo Alto, California on November 15, 2009; _provided_ , _however_
, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.2(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose breach of a representation
or warranty or covenant made under this Agreement by such party results in the
failure of any condition set forth in _Article VIII_ to be fulfilled or
satisfied on or before such date.

(c) Either Parent or the Company, by giving written notice to the other, may
terminate this Agreement at any time prior to the Effective Time if the other
has committed a breach of (i) any of its representations and warranties under
_Article III_ or _Article IV_ , as applicable, or (ii) any of its covenants
under _Article V_ or _Article VI_ , as applicable, and has not cured such
breach within ten (10) business days after the party seeking to terminate this
Agreement has given the other party written notice of such breach and its
intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section 9.2(c)_ (
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such cure period shall be available or
applicable to any such breach which by its nature cannot be cured) and if not
cured on or prior to the Closing Date, such breach would result in the
failure of any of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ , as applicable,
to be fulfilled or satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.2(c)_ shall not be available
to a party if the party is at that time in material breach of this Agreement.



 

70 (d) Parent, by giving written notice to the Company, may terminate this
Agreement if (i) the Companys Board of Directors shall have for any reason
recommended, endorsed, accepted or agreed to an Alternative Transaction or
shall have resolved to do any of the foregoing, or (iii) if an inquiry, offer
or proposal for an Alternative Transaction shall have been made and the
Companys Board of Directors of the Company in connection therewith does not
within ten (10) business days of Parents request to do so reconfirm its
approval and recommendation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and reject such Alternative Transaction.

(e) The Company, by giving written notice to Parent, may terminate this
Agreement (at any time prior to the approval and adoption of this Agreement by
the required vote of the stockholders of the Company) if the Company has
received a Superior Proposal and the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in its good faith judgment, confirmed by advice of outside legal
counsel, that it is required to recommend or accept such Superior Proposal
provided that the Company complies with the provisions of  _Section 5.7_.

9.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in  _Section 9.2_, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company or their respective officers, directors, stockholders or
Affiliates; provided, however, that (i) the provisions of this _Section 9.3_
(Effect of Termination) and _Article XI_ (Miscellaneous) shall remain in full
force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii)
nothing herein shall relieve any party hereto from liability in connection
with any material breach of any of such partys representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein.

ARTICLE X

NO SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

10.1 _No Survival_. If the Merger is consummated, none of the representations
and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive
the Merger. This _Section 10.1_ shall not limit any covenant or agreement of
the parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective
Time.

ARTICLE XI

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 _Governing Law_. The internal laws of the State of Delaware,
irrespective of its conflicts of law principles, shall govern the validity of
this Agreement, the construction of its terms, the interpretation and
enforcement of the rights and duties of the parties hereto and the
consummation and effects of the Merger.

11.2 _Assignment; Binding Upon Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Parent, including any
successor to, or assignee of, all or substantially all of the business and
assets of Parent. Except as set forth in the preceding



 

71  sentence, no party hereto may assign any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment
in violation of this provision shall be void.

11.3 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to
other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to effect
the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.

11.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original as regards any party whose
signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and
the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or more
counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the signatures
of all parties reflected hereon as signatories. This Agreement may
be executed and delivered by one party hereto to the other parties hereto by
facsimile or e-mail transmission of a photocopy of the original signature page
hereto, and upon receipt of such facsimile or e-mail transmission by the other
parties hereto, the photocopy of the original signature page included in such
facsimile or e-mail transmission will be deemed to have the same effect as if
the original signature had been delivered to the other parties. The parties
shall endeavor to exchange the original signature copies, but the failure to
deliver the original signature copy and/or the nonreceipt of the original
signature copy shall have no effect upon the binding and enforceable nature of
this Agreement.

11.5 _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party hereunder shall be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby
or by law on such party, and the exercise of any one remedy shall not preclude
the exercise of any other. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of the
United States or any State having jurisdiction.

11.6 _Amendments and Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
amended, and the observance of any term of this Agreement may be waived
(either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively or
prospectively), only by a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby. The
waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the performance hereof
shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any
succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto as provided in this _Section 11.6_ at any time before or after
adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders, but, after such
adoption, no amendment shall be made which by Applicable Law requires the
further approval of the Company Stockholders without obtaining such further
approval. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each of Company and
Parent, by action taken



 

72  by its Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the
other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to it contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for its benefit
contained herein. No such waiver or extension shall be effective unless
signed in writing by the party against whom such waiver or extension is
asserted. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof
shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such party
thereafter to enforce such provisions.

11.7 _Expenses_. As otherwise provided herein, whether or not the Merger is
successfully consummated, each party shall bear its respective legal,
accountants, and financial advisory fees and other expenses incurred with
respect to this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

11.8 _Attorneys  Fees_. Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret any
part of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, as
an element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys fees
to be fixed by the court (including costs, expenses and fees on any appeal).
The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs of suit,
regardless of whether such suit proceeds to final judgment.

11.9 _Notices_. All notices and other communications required or permitted
under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be either hand delivered in
person, sent by facsimile, sent by certified or registered first-class mail,
postage pre-paid, or sent by nationally recognized express courier service.
Such notices and other communications shall be effective upon receipt if hand
delivered or sent by facsimile, three (3) business days after mailing if sent
by mail, and one business day after dispatch if sent by express courier, to

intended, nor shall be interpreted, to provide or create any third party
beneficiary rights or any other rights of any kind in any client, customer,

Parent shall not be bound by such Confidentiality Agreement after the Closing.
If this Agreement is terminated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect, and all copies of documents containing confidential
information of a disclosing party shall be returned by the receiving party to
the disclosing party or be destroyed, as provided in the Confidentiality
Agreement.



 

74 11.13 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the exhibits and schedules hereto,
the Company Ancillary Agreements, the Parent Ancillary Agreements and the
Merger Sub Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire understanding and
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements or understandings,
inducements or conditions, express or implied, written or oral, between the
parties with respect hereto other than the Confidentiality Agreement. The
express terms hereof control and supersede any course of performance or usage
of the trade inconsistent with any of the terms hereof.

11.14 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB, THE COMPANY AND THE
REPRESENTATIVE HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
