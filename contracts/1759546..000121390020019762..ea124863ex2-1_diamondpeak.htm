context of a transaction such as the one contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company entered into agreements with those certain Stockholders (such
agreements, the " _Confirmatory Agreements_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, it is intended that, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger
shall qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this

Article I 
  
 The Merger; Closing

corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease, (b) the Company
shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and from and after the
Effective Time, shall be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and the
separate corporate existence of the Company with all of its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by
the Merger, except, in each case, as expressly set forth in _Section 1.4_ and
_Section 1.5_ and as provided in the DGCL, and (c) the Merger shall have
such other effects as provided in the DGCL.

  



  

   

-2-

 



    



  

Section 1.2 _Time and Place of Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place at 9:00 a.m. (New York Time), at the offices of
Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 125 Broad Street, New York, NY 10004 (or, if mutually
agreed by Parent and the Company, by means of a virtual closing through
electronic exchange of signatures), on the fifth (5th) Business Day following
the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the
last condition in _Article VI _to be satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waiver of those conditions) or at such other time and place as Parent and the
Company mutually agree (the " _Closing Date_ ").

  



  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following, and on the
date of, the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause a certificate of
merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be
executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware as provided in Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at the time when the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with
and accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at
such later date and time as may be agreed by the Parties in writing and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the " _Effective
Time_ ").

  



  

Section 1.4 _The Certificate of Incorporation of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of each
of Parent and Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated to be in
the form of the certificates of incorporation set forth in _Exhibit D_ (the
" _Amended and Restated Parent Charter_ ") and _Exhibit E_,
respectively, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law. The Amended and Restated Parent Charter shall provide,  _inter alia_ ,
that the name of Parent shall be Lordstown Motors Corp.

  



  

Section 1.5 _The Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. The Parties shall take
all actions necessary so that the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated to be in the form of the bylaws set forth in

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers_. The Parties shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that immediately following the Effective Time, (i) the
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be comprised of the
Persons whose names are set forth on _Schedule 1.6_ or their successors as

Article II 
  
 Merger Consideration; Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock

  



  

Section 2.1 _Merger Consideration; Conversion of Shares of Company Stock_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Parties or any holder of any capital stock of the Company,
(i) each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time (other than (x) shares of Company Common Stock that are held by
Dissenting Stockholders (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") and (y) shares of Company
Common Stock that are held by Non-Accredited Investors (" _Non -Accredited
Investor Shares_") shall be converted into, and become exchangeable for the
number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to the
_quotient obtained by dividing_ (A) the Purchase Price _by_ (B) $10.00 _by_
(C) the Fully Diluted Share Number (such number of shares of Parent Class A
Common Stock, the " _Stock Merger Consideration_ ") and (ii) each Non-
Accredited Investor Share shall be converted into, and become exchangeable
for, the right to receive an amount in cash in Dollars equal to the _quotient
obtained by dividing_ (A) the Purchase Price _by_ (B) the Fully Diluted Share
Number (such number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, the " _Cash
Merger Consideration_ "). The Cash Merger Consideration or Stock Merger
Consideration that a Stockholder shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this
_Section 2.1(a)_ is referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ ".
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Parent, in its sole
discretion, determines that any Stockholder is an Accredited Investor despite
such holder's failure to deliver an investor questionnaire, then Parent may
elect to treat such holder as an Accredited Investor for all purposes under
this Agreement.

  



  

(b) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties
or any holder of any capital stock of the Company, all of the shares of
Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) shall represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Article II_, shall
cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the
Effective Time, and each certificate formerly representing any of the shares
of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
_Section 2.1_.

  



  

(c) Each Dissenting Share shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder of such Dissenting Share, cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and
shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the holder thereof may have under
_Section 2.14._

  



  

Section 2.2 _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and each
certificate or book-entry account therefor shall continue to evidence an
equivalent number of shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

   

-4-

 



    



  

Section 2.3 _PIPE Investment_. At the Closing, the PIPE Investors and Parent
shall consummate the PIPE Investment pursuant to and in accordance with the
terms of the applicable Subscription Agreements.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Treatment of Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Company Option_ ") under the Stock Plans (as defined in _Section 3.2(b)_),
whether vested or unvested, shall automatically and without any required
action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent an option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into an option
to purchase a number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock equal to
the product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration, at an exercise
price per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) the Merger
Consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that the exercise price and
the number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock purchasable pursuant to
the Company Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with avoiding
adverse taxation under Section 409A of the Code. Except as specifically
provided above, following the Effective Time, each Company Option shall
continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions (including vesting
and exercisability terms) as were applicable to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time. At or prior to the Effective Time,
the Company and the Company Board shall adopt any resolutions and take any
actions that are necessary to effectuate the treatment of Company Options
contemplated by this _Section 2.4_.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the Parent Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt
a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock by the Parent or options to
purchase shares of Parent Common Stock upon conversion of Company Options,
pursuant to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to any officer,
director or shareholder (by reason of "director by deputization") of the
Company or Parent who is expected to become a "covered person" of Parent for
purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder (" _Section 16_") shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of
Section 16.

  



  

Section 2.6 _Tax Consequences of the Merger_. It is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a
"plan of reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the
Code.

  



  

   

-5-

 



    



  

Section 2.7 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued
upon the payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section
2.1._ All fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that a Stockholder would
be otherwise entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.1_, but for this
_Section 2.7_, shall be aggregated and rounded to three decimal places and
such holder shall be entitled to receive a cash payment, without interest, in
lieu of any such fractional share, which payment shall be calculated by Parent
and shall represent such holder's proportionate interest in a share of Parent
Common Stock represented by such fractional share based on a price per share
of $10.00. No Stockholder shall be entitled by virtue of the right to receive
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock described in this 
_Section 2.7_ to any dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect
of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock. The payment of cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is not a separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding-off of the
fractions in the exchange.

  



  

Section 2.8 _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with an exchange agent selected by Parent
(with the consent of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) to serve as the exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock, an aggregate number of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to
be issued in non-certificated book-entry form and an aggregate amount of cash,
in each case, comprising the amounts required to be delivered in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.1_ and _2.7_. The
relative amounts of Stock Merger Consideration and Cash Merger Consideration
initially deposited will be determined based on information contained in
investor questionnaires delivered pursuant to Section 2.9 at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time or as otherwise determined by
Parent in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.1(a). If,
subsequent to such deposit, the relative amounts of Stock Merger
Consideration and Cash Merger Consideration are adjusted due to receipt of
additional investor questionnaires or otherwise, the amounts on deposit with
the Exchange Agent shall be adjusted accordingly. In addition, Parent shall
deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from
time to time after the Effective Time, any dividends or other distributions,
if any, to which the holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.10_ with both a record and payment date after the
Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such shares of Company Common
Stock. Such shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, cash and the amount of any
dividends or other distributions deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant
to this _Section 2.8_ are referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ". The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than a purpose expressly
provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund may be
deposited by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent. To the
extent that there are losses with respect to such deposits, a default of an
applicable bank or for any other reason any amount in the Exchange Fund is
below that required to make prompt payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration and the other payments contemplated by this _Article
II_, Parent shall promptly replace, restore or supplement the shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock or cash, as applicable, in the Exchange Fund so
as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level
sufficient for the Exchange Agent to make the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration and the other payments contemplated by this _Article II_. Any
interest and other income resulting from such deposit may become part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under
_Section 2.1_ may, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to
Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective
Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in
respect of all shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or
other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Class A Common Stock shall

evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable, in each case, in form and substance, reasonably satisfactory to
the Exchange Agent. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.11_, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock, if any, and any unpaid
non-stock dividends and any other dividends or other distributions, in each
case, payable or issuable pursuant to this _Article II_.

properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except in
the case of clause (b) or (c) where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, or to have such power or authority, could not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
Company's certificates of incorporation and by-laws or comparable governing
documents, each as amended to the Execution Date ("

complete list of all outstanding Company Options as of the date of
this Agreement, setting forth the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to each Company Option and the holder, grant date and exercise price

correct (i) description of the number of shares of Company Common Stock held

respects as of Closing and (ii) allocation of the amount of the Merger
Consideration to be paid or delivered to each Stockholder in accordance with

preceding sentence shall assume (i) in the case of the Schedule 3.2 delivered
with this Agreement, the assumptions as to the Trust Account and Private
Placement set forth therein, (ii) in the case of the updates to Schedule 3.2,
the assumptions provided by Parent regarding the Trust Account and Private

and the Transaction Documents to which it is a party do not, and
the consummation of the Transactions will not, conflict with, or result in
any breach or violation of or default (with or without notice, lapse of time,

provision of (i) the Organizational Documents of the Company, (ii) any
Contract not otherwise terminable by the other party thereto on ninety (90)
days' or less notice or (iii) assuming (solely with respect to performance of

risk factor, forward-looking statement (or similarly captioned section) and
any other disclosures therein to the extent they are of a predictive or
cautionary nature or related to forward-looking statements (it being
acknowledged that nothing disclosed in the Parent Reports will be deemed to
modify or qualify the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1
(Organization; Good Standing and Qualification), Section 4.2 (Capital
Structure), and Section 4.3 (Authority; Approval)), or (ii) in the
corresponding sections or subsections of the disclosure letter delivered to
the Company by Parent prior to the Execution Date (the " _Parent Disclosure

assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification,

or in good standing or to have such power or authority, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material

Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which they are a party do not,

time or both) under, or give rise to any right of termination, loss of rights,

has made, arranged or modified (in any material way) any extensions of credit
in the form of a personal loan to any executive officer or director of
Parent.

  



  

(c) Except as not required in reliance on exemptions from various reporting
requirements by virtue of Parent's status as an "emerging growth company"
within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our
Business Startups Act of 2012, Parent maintains disclosure controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such

information required to be disclosed by Parent, is recorded and reported on a
timely basis to the individuals responsible for the preparation of Parent's
filings with the SEC.

  



  

(d) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by

-31-

 



    



  

(e) Parent maintains systems of internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the Exchange Act) that
are sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and
includes policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of
records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of Parent, (ii) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, (iii)
that receipts and expenditures of Parent are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of Parent, and (iv) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of Parent's assets that could have a material
effect on its financial statements.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Absence of Certain Changes_. Since Parent's incorporation and
through the date of this Agreement (a) Parent has conducted its business in
the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practices in all
material respects (except for the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement) and (b) there has not been any change, occurrence or
development in the financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities,
business or results of operations or any other change, occurrence or
development, which has had, or would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the
ability of Parent to consummate the Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.7 _Litigation and Liabilities_.

  



  

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Actions pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing against Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably

Parent to consummate the Transactions.

  



  

(b) Since its date of incorporation, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has
carried on any business or conducted any operations other than: (i) directed
towards the accomplishment of a business combination and (ii) the execution
of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party,
the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and matters
ancillary thereto. Other than under the Transaction Documents or pursuant to
the performance of its obligations thereunder, neither Parent nor Merger
Sub has any liabilities. Parent is not a party to or subject to the
provisions of any Order that restricts the manner in which Parent conducts
its business except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of
Parent to consummate the Transactions.

Section 4.8 _Parent Trust Account_. As of the Execution Date, Parent has
approximately $284,300,000 in the account established by Parent for the
benefit of its stockholders at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the "
_Parent Trust Account_ "), such monies being invested in U.S. Government
treasury bills or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and
held in trust pursuant to that certain Investment Management Trust Agreement,
dated as of February 27, 2019, between Parent and American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company, LLC, as trustee (the " _Parent Trust Agreement_ "). The Parent
Trust Agreement is valid and in full force and effect and enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception,
and has not been amended or modified. Parent has complied in all material
respects with the terms of the Parent Trust Agreement and is not in breach
thereof or default thereunder and there does not exist under the Parent Trust
Agreement any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time,
would constitute such a breach or default by Parent or the trustee under the
Parent Trust Agreement (the " _Trustee_ "). There are no separate Contracts,
side letters or other arrangements or understandings (whether written or
unwritten, express or implied) that would cause the description of the Parent
Trust Agreement in the Parent Reports to be inaccurate in any material
respect or that would, to the Knowledge of Parent, entitle any Person (other
than pursuant to a Parent Share Redemption) to any portion of the proceeds in
the Parent Trust Account. There are no proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened with respect to the Parent Trust Account.
Upon the consummation of the Merger and notice thereof to the Trustee pursuant
to the Parent Trust Agreement, Parent shall cause the Trustee to, and the
Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to Parent as promptly as
practicable, the funds in the Parent Trust Account in accordance with the
Parent Trust Agreement at which point the Parent Trust Account shall
terminate; provided, however, that the liabilities and obligations of Parent
due and owing or incurred at or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as
and when due, including all amounts payable (a) to stockholders of Parent
who shall have exercised applicable redemption rights, (b) with respect to
filings, applications and/or other actions taken pursuant to this Agreement
required under Law, (c) to the Trustee for fees and costs incurred in
accordance with the Parent Trust Agreement; and (d) to third parties (e.g.,
professionals, printers, etc.) who have rendered services to Parent in
connection with its efforts to effect the Merger. As of the Execution Date,
assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
herein and the compliance by the Company with its respective obligations
hereunder, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
use of funds in the Parent Trust Account will not be satisfied or funds
available in the Parent Trust Account will not be available to Parent at the
Effective Time.

  



  

Section 4.9 _PIPE Investments_. Parent has made available to the Company
true, correct and complete copies of the Subscription Agreements. As of the
date of this Agreement, the Subscription Agreements (a) are in full force and
effect without amendment or modification, (b) are the valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Parent (or its applicable Affiliate) and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto (except, in any case, as
may be limited by Bankruptcy and Equity Exception) and (c) have not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. The PIPE Investment,
together with the amount in the Parent Trust Account at the Closing, will be
in the aggregate sufficient to enable Parent to (a) pay all cash
amounts required to be paid by Parent under or in connection with this
Agreement and (b) pay any and all Transaction Expenses. There are no other
Contracts between Parent and any PIPE Investor relating to any Subscription
Agreement, that would reasonably be expected to affect the obligations of the
PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the
PIPE Investment set forth in the Subscription Agreements, and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, no facts or circumstances exist that may reasonably be
expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in any Subscription
Agreement not being satisfied, or the PIPE Investment not being available to
Parent, on the Closing Date. No event has occurred that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the
part of Parent under any material term or condition of any Subscription
Agreement and, as of the Execution Date, Parent has no reason to believe that
it will be unable to satisfy in all material respects on a timely basis any
term or condition of Closing to be satisfied by it contained in any
Subscription Agreement. The Subscription Agreements contain all of the
conditions precedent (other than the conditions contained in this Agreement
or the Transaction Documents) to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to
contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE Investment set forth
in the Subscription Agreements on the terms therein.

Agreement, will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and will be issued free and clear of any Liens (other than such

to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Parent
acknowledges that the Company Common Stock is not registered under the
Securities Act, any state securities Laws or any other applicable securities

sold except pursuant to the registration provisions of the Securities Act or

brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees or other similar payments in
connection with the Transactions, except that Parent has employed Goldman
Sachs and Co. LLC as its financial advisor in connection with the Transactions.

  



  

Section 4.13 _Information Supplied; Proxy_. The information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the Proxy will not, at the time the Proxy is first mailed to the stockholders
of Parent and at the time of the Parent Special Meeting to be held in
connection with the Transactions, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no representation or warranty is made by the Parent with respect
to (a) statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy based on
information that was supplied by the Company or its Representatives or (b)
any projections or forecasts included in the Proxy.

which to file) all material Tax Returns required to be filed by any of them
and all such filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all material
respects, (b) have paid all material Taxes that are required to be paid,
except with respect to current Taxes not yet due and payable or otherwise
being contested in good faith and (c) have not waived any statute

Execution Date, there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Merger
Sub, threatened in writing, audits, examinations, investigations or other
proceedings in respect of material Taxes or Tax matters. To the Knowledge of
Parent or Merger Sub, there are no unresolved questions or claims concerning
the Parent's or Merger Sub's Tax liability that would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Parent
and Merger Sub are not a party to and are not bound by any Tax sharing,
allocation or indemnification agreement or arrangement. Parent and Merger Sub

federal income Tax Return for which the statute of limitations is open

have any liability for the Taxes of any person under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign law), as

(or series of related transactions)" within the meaning of Section 355(e) of
the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a "distributing corporation" or

Section 4.15 _Investigation and Reliance_. Unless any such information is
expressly and specifically included in a representation or warranty contained
in Article III of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
stockholders, Affiliates or Representatives shall have any liability to
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective stockholders, Affiliates or
Representatives resulting from the use of any projections, forecasts or
estimates made available to Parent, its Affiliates, or any of

interest to pay any tax obligation owed by Parent as a result of assets owned
by Parent, including franchise taxes prior to the Closing and (ii) to
effectuate the Parent Share Redemption. Following the Closing, and upon notice
to the trustee of the Parent Trust Account (the " _Parent Trustee_ ") and the
satisfaction of the requirements for release set forth in the Parent Trust
Agreement, the Parent Trustee shall be obligated to release as promptly as
practicable any and all amounts still due to holders of shares of Parent
Common Stock who have exercised their redemption rights with respect to
shares of Parent Common Stock, and, thereafter, release the remaining funds
in the Parent Trust Account to Parent to be reflected on
Parent's consolidated balance sheet and the Parent Trust Account shall
thereafter be terminated.

  



  

   

-41-

 



    



  

(b) _Trust Account Waiver_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i)
Parent is a blank check company with the power and privileges to effect a
merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar business combination
involving the Company and one or more businesses or assets and (ii) Parent's
sole assets consist of the cash proceeds of Parent's initial public offering
and private placements of its securities, and that substantially all of these
proceeds have been deposited in the Parent Trust Account for the benefit of
Parent's public stockholders until the Closing. For and in consideration of
Parent entering into this Agreement, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, Company on behalf of itself and any of its managers,
directors, officers, affiliates, members, stockholders and trustees, hereby
irrevocably waives any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they have
or may have in the future in or to any monies in the Parent Trust Account, and
agrees not to seek recourse against the Parent Trust Account or any funds
distributed therefrom in accordance with the terms of this Agreement as a
result of, or arising out of, any claims against Parent arising under this
Agreement (it being agreed that such waiver shall automatically terminate
without further action by any party hereto at the Closing and shall not apply
following the Closing to the Parent Trust Account funds that are released
from the Parent Trust Account to Parent pursuant to _Section 5.3_).

  



  

(c) _Parent Share Redemption_. At the Closing, Parent shall use its best
efforts to cause the Parent Trustee to pay as and when due all amounts
payable to stockholders of Parent holding shares of the Parent Common Stock
sold in Parent's initial public offering who shall have validly elected to
redeem their shares of Parent Common Stock (and who have not rescinded such
election) pursuant to Parent's Organizational Documents and shall use its
best efforts to cause the Parent Trustee to pay, as and when due, the
Deferred Discount (as defined in the Parent Trust Agreement) pursuant to the
terms of the Parent Trust Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Note Conversion_. Parent agrees to issue Parent Class A Common
Stock to the holder(s) of each Convertible Promissory Note in accordance with
the terms thereof as of the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.5 _BGL Warrants_. Parent agrees to issue the BGL Warrants to BGL in
accordance with the terms of the BGL Subscription, Registration and Lock-
Up Agreement as of the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.6 _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the proxy statement relating to
the Parent Special Meeting (as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
" _Proxy_ "). Parent and the Company each shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to respond promptly to comments from the SEC and resolve
any such comments as promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing, to
promptly thereafter mail the Proxy to the stockholders of the Parent.

  



  

(b) The Parent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt of all
comments (written or oral) from the SEC and of any request (written or oral)
by the SEC for any amendment or supplement to the Proxy or for additional
information and shall promptly provide to the other copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives and the SEC with
respect to the Proxy.

  



  

(c) Each of Parent and the Company will provide its respective legal counsel
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on drafts of the Proxy
and other documents related to the Parent Special Meeting or the Parent
Stockholder Proposals, prior to filing such documents with the applicable
Governmental Entity and mailing such documents to the stockholders of Parent.
Each Party will include in the Proxy and such other documents related to
Parent Special Meeting all comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the
other Party or its legal counsel and each agrees that all information
relating to Parent and Merger Sub included in the Proxy shall be in form and
content satisfactory to Parent, acting reasonably, and all information
relating to the Company included in the Proxy shall be in form and content
satisfactory to the Company, acting reasonably.

  



  

   

-42-

 



    



  

Section 5.7 _Parent Meeting_. Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to
take, in accordance with applicable Law, NASDAQ rules and its Organizational
Documents, all action necessary to convene the Parent Special Meeting as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the SEC advises it has no further
comments on the Proxy (the " _SEC Clearance Date_ ") (and will commence the
mailing of the Proxy to the Parent Stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the SEC Clearance Date and schedule such meeting for a date that is no
more than 35 days after the Proxy is mailed), to (i) consider and vote upon
the approval of the Parent Stockholder Proposals and to cause such vote to be
taken and (ii) provide Parent Stockholders with the opportunity to elect to
effect a Parent Share Redemption. Parent may only elect to postpone or
adjourn such meeting if (x) a postponement or adjournment is required by Law,
(y) as of the time for which the Parent Special Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy) there are insufficient
shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) and
voting to approve the Parent Stockholder Proposals or to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Parent Special Meeting or (z) Parent
determines the payments for the Parent Share Redemption could reasonably
be expected to cause the conditions in _Section 6.3_ to not be satisfied at
the Closing. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its
stockholders proxies as promptly as possible in favor of the
Parent Stockholder Proposals and include in the Proxy the Parent Board
Recommendation; _provided_ , _that_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, at any
time prior to obtaining approval of the Parent Stockholder Proposals, the
Parent Board may fail to make, amend, change, withdraw, modify, withhold or
qualify the Parent Board Recommendation (any such action, a " _Change in
Recommendation_ ") if the Parent Board shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
that a failure to make a Change in Recommendation would violate its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and following such Change in Recommendation the
obligation to solicit proxies in favor of the Parent Stockholder Proposals
shall terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, a Change in Recommendation will
not affect Parent's obligations pursuant to this _Section 5.7_ (other than as
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence) or elsewhere in this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.8 _ Approval of Sole Stockholder of Merger Sub_. Immediately
following approval of the Parent Stockholder Proposals, Parent shall execute
and deliver, in accordance with applicable Law and its Organizational
Documents, in its capacity as sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written
consent adopting the plan of merger contained in this Agreement.

Laws, including Section 228, Section 251(c) and Section 262 of the DGCL, and
the Company's Organizational Documents, promptly following the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall seek and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain (a) as promptly as practicable, and in any event, within
twenty-four (24) hours following the execution of this Agreement (the "
_Stockholder Support Delivery Period_ "), the Initial Stockholder Consent and
(b) as promptly as practicable, Support Agreements from Stockholders holding
at least 95% of the Company Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the
Execution Date, in each case, in lieu of a meeting pursuant to Section 228 of
the DGCL for the purposes of (i) adopting this Agreement and approving the
Merger, (ii) acknowledging that the adoption and approvals are irrevocable
and result in the waiver of any right of such stockholders to demand
appraisal in connection with the Merger pursuant to the Delaware Law and
(iii) such other matters set forth therein. As promptly as practicable and,
in any event, prior to the expiration of the Stockholder Support Delivery
Period, if the Initial Stockholder Consent is obtained Company, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a copy thereof (including by facsimile or other
electronic image scan transmission), certified as correct and complete by an
executive officer of the Company.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Information Statement_. Promptly, and in any case at the same
time as any Support Agreement is solicited from any Stockholder (other than
the Initial Stockholder Consents), the Company shall prepare (with the
cooperation of Parent) and mail to each Stockholder an information statement
regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which shall be in a
form reasonably acceptable to Parent (as it may be amended or supplemented
from time to time, the " _Information Statement_ "). The Information
Statement shall constitute an information statement for the
Company's solicitation of consent of the holders of Company Common Stock with
respect to the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger and
shall include (a) a statement to the effect that the Company's board of
directors had unanimously recommended that the holders of Company Common
Stock vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the
Merger and (b) such other information as Parent and the Company reasonably
agree is required or advisable under applicable Law to be included therein.
The Company shall, with the cooperation of Parent (to the extent
reasonably required), prepare any other necessary documentation required or
advisable to be provided to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
DGCL. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Parent or the
Company for inclusion in the Information Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto will contain, as of the date of the delivery of such
document, any untrue statement of a material fact, or will omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. Together with the
Information Statement, the Company will mail to each holder of record of each
Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to a
Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu of a Certificate as provided in _Section 2.13_) to the
Exchange Agent (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), (ii) instructions for
surrendering a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of a Certificate as
provided in _Section 2.13_)) to the Exchange Agent and (iii) an investor
questionnaire in the form prepared by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to
the Company.

expenses incurred prior to the Closing for which payment has been made and

Employee's employment with the Company for purposes of vesting, benefit
accrual and eligibility to participate under each applicable benefit plan of
Parent, as if such service had been performed with Parent, except for benefit

officers or employees of the Company pertaining to compensation or benefit
matters that are affected by the Transactions, the Company shall provide
Parent with a copy of the intended communication, Parent shall have a

Section 5.16 _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing, the Company shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless
and reimburse to the fullest extent that the Company may lawfully do so, each
current director and officer of the Company (in each case, when acting in
such capacity), determined as of the Closing (the " _Indemnitees_ "), against
any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with,
arising out of or otherwise related to any Action arising out of matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing, whether asserted or claimed
prior to, at or after the Closing, including in connection with (i)
the Transactions and (ii) actions to enforce this _Section 5.16_ or any
other indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnitee, and Parent
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and the Company's Organizational Documents in effect as of the
Execution Date; _provided_ , _that_ any Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
by final adjudication that such Person is not entitled to indemnification;
and _provided_ , _further_ , that any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnitee's conduct complies with the standards set
forth under applicable Law and the Company's Organizational Documents in
effect as of the Execution Date shall be made by independent legal counsel
selected by Parent and acceptable to the Indemnitee (such acceptance not to
be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).

  

  



  

(b) Any Indemnitee wishing to claim indemnification under _Section 5.16(a)_,
upon learning of any such Action for which indemnification under this _Section
5.16_ may be available, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure
to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any
liability it may have to such Indemnitee, except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such Action
(whether arising before or after the Closing), (i) Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof ( _it being
understood_  and agreed that by electing to assume the defense thereof,
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be deemed to have waived
any right to object to the Indemnitee's entitlement to indemnification
hereunder with respect thereto or assumed any liability with respect
thereto), except that if Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to
assume such defense or the legal counsel for the Indemnitees advises that
there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees, the Indemnitees may retain legal
counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent shall pay all reasonable and
documented fees and expenses of such legal counsel for the Indemnitees
promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this
_Section 5.16(b)_ to pay for only one legal counsel for all Indemnitees in
any jurisdiction unless the use of one legal counsel for such Indemnitees
would present such advisor with a conflict of interest; _provided_ , _further_
, that the smallest number of legal counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of
interest shall be used, (ii) the Indemnitees shall cooperate in the defense
of any such matter if Parent and the Surviving Corporation elect not to assume
such defense; (iii) the Indemnitees shall not be liable for any settlement
effected without their prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) if Parent and the Surviving
Corporation elect to assume such defense and neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without their prior
written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or
delayed); (iv) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnified action of such Indemnitee in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law; and (v) all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such Actions shall continue until final
disposition of all such Actions. If indemnity is not available with respect to
any Indemnitee pursuant to this _Section 5.16_, then the Parent and the
Indemnitee shall contribute to the amount payable in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect relative faults and benefits.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and if the Company is unable to,
Parent shall cause the Company as of the Closing to obtain and fully pay the
premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the directors'
and officers' liability coverage of the Company's existing directors' and
officers' insurance policies, and (ii) the Company's existing fiduciary
liability insurance policies, in each case with a claims reporting or
discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the Closing from
one or more insurance carriers with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's insurance carrier as of the Execution Date with respect to
directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable to the
insureds as the Company's existing policies with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Closing (including in connection with
the Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
Company expend for such policies a premium amount in excess of the amount set
forth in Section 5.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter. If the Company for any
reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the Closing, the
Company shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to, continue to maintain in
effect for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Closing the
DandO Insurance in place as of the Execution Date with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided
in the Company's existing policies as of the Execution Date, or the Company
shall, and Parent shall cause the Company to purchase comparable DandO
Insurance for such six (6)-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are at least as favorable as provided in the
Company's existing policies as of the Execution Date; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall the annual cost of the DandO Insurance exceed during
the six (6) years from and after the Closing three hundred percent (300%) of
the current aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for such purpose; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the cost of such insurance coverage exceeds
such amount, the Company shall obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount..

  



  

(d) During the six (6)-year period from and after the Closing, all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Closing and rights to advancement of expenses relating
thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnitee as provided in the
Organizational Documents of the Company or any indemnification agreement
between such Indemnitee and the Company, in each case, as in effect on the
Execution Date, shall not be amended, restated, amended and restated, repealed
or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such Indemnitee.

  



  

(e) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective legal
successors or permitted assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the legal successors and permitted assigns
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.16_.

  



  

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.16_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and from and after the Closing shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee,
who is an intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section 5.16_.

  



  

(g) The rights of the Indemnitees under this _Section 5.16_ shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnitees may have under the Organizational
Documents of the Company and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or
under any applicable Contracts or Laws and nothing in this Agreement is
intended to, shall be construed or shall release or impair any rights to
directors' and officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has
been in existence with respect to the Company for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees ( _it being understood and agreed_ that
the indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.16_ is not prior to or
in substitution of any such claims under such policies).

respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated

minimis_ respects as of the Execution Date and as of the Closing as though
made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of an earlier date, in which
case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of such
earlier date).

  



  

(ii) The other representations and warranties of Parent contained in _Article
IV_ and any certificates delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall be true
and correct (without giving effect to any materiality qualifiers, including
Material Adverse Effect, contained therein) as of the Execution Date and as
of the Closing Date as though made on and as of such date and time (except to
the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of
an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct as of such earlier date), except where the failure of any such
representation and warranty to be so true and correct would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of Parent to consummate the Transactions.

  



  

(b) _Performance of Obligations of Parent_. Parent shall have performed and
complied in all material respects with all covenants required to be performed
by it under this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date, other than the
obligations set forth in _Section 5.2(b)(iii)_  which shall be performed and
complied with in all respects.

  



  

(c) _Closing Certificate_. The Company shall have received at the Closing a
certificate signed on behalf of Parent by a duly authorized officer of Parent
(solely in their capacity as such and not in their personal capacity, and
without personal liability), certifying that the conditions set forth in
_Section 6.3(a), Section 6.3(b), and Section 6.3(d) _have been satisfied.

  



  

(d) _Listing_. The shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued as the

subject only to official notice of issuance.

Investment and after distribution of the Parent Trust Account, pursuant to
_Section 5.3(a)_, deducting all amounts to be paid pursuant to the Parent
Share Redemption, Parent shall have cash on hand equal to or in excess of
$300,000,000 (without, for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account any
Transaction Expenses).

  

  



  

Section 6.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. A Party may not rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in _Section 6.1_,  _Section 6.2_ or
_Section 6.3_, as the case may be, to be satisfied if such failure was due to
the failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement.

material respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, or any of its representations and warranties shall have become
untrue after the Execution Date, which breach or failure to perform or be
true (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section
6.1_ or _Section 6.3_ and (ii) is not curable or, if curable, is not cured
by the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after written notice thereof is given
by the Company to Parent and (B) the Outside Date; _provided_ , _that_

material respect any of its covenants or other agreements contained in this
Agreement, or any of its representations and warranties shall have become
untrue after the Execution Date, which breach or failure to perform or be
true (i) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section
6.1_ or _Section 6.2_, respectively and (ii) is not curable or, if curable,
is not cured by the earlier of (A) thirty (30) days after written notice
thereof is given by Parent to the Company and (B) the Outside Date; _provided_
, _that_  Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(e)_ if Parent is then in breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements hereunder such that
it would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.1_
or _Section 6.3; or_

  



  

(f) by the Company if Parent has made a Change in Recommendation.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. In the event of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this  _Article VII_, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person

Article VIII 
  
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1 _Survival_.

  



  

(a) Each representation, warranty, covenant and other obligation in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing, but only to the extent, and until the
applicable survival date, specified in this Section 8.1(a), whereupon it shall
terminate; _provided_ , _that_  if a claim with respect thereto shall be made

-58-

 



    



  

(iv) The survival date applicable to the covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement shall be (A) with respect to covenants and agreements that
require performance in full prior to the Closing, the Closing Date, and (B)

(b) No provision of this _Article VIII_ shall apply to or limit any claim
that a Party committed common law fraud under Delaware Law in making any
representation or warranty contained in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ of
this Agreement, which may be brought at any time until lapse of the
applicable statute of limitations provided by Delaware Law. The right of
a Person to any remedy pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall not be affected
by any investigation or examination conducted, or any Knowledge possessed or
acquired (or capable of being possessed or acquired), by such Person at any
time concerning any circumstance, action, omission or event relating to the
accuracy or performance of any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation. Except in the case of common law fraud under Delaware Law, no
Person shall be required to show reliance on any representation,
warranty, certificate or covenant in order for such Person to be entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder.

  



  

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by the Majority Stockholder_. Following the
Closing, the Majority Stockholder shall indemnify, defend, hold harmless and
reimburse each of Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates and Representatives,
respective successors and permitted assigns (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against all Losses imposed on, incurred or suffered by or asserted
against any Parent Indemnified Party in connection with or arising out of:

  



  

(a) the failure of any Company Fundamental Representation to be true and
accurate as of the Closing (or, in the case of any representation or warranty
that expressly speaks as of a different date, such date) _it being understood_
that for purposes of this _Section 8.2(a)_ any qualifications relating to
materiality (such as the terms "material" and "Material Adverse Effect") or
relating to Knowledge contained in such representation or warranty (other than
the representation and warranty set forth in  _Section 3.6_ ( _Absence of
Certain Changes_ )) shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether
such representation or warranty was not true and accurate or the quantity of
such Losses;

  



  

(b) the failure of the Company to fully perform any covenant or obligation of
the Company contained in this Agreement that is required to be performed
prior to the Closing; or

  



  

(c) any claim, cause of action, right or remedy, or any Action, asserted at
any time by any actual or alleged securityholder of the Company relating to
the allocation or entitlement to a portion of the consideration paid or to be
paid in connection with the Transactions, including any assertion of
contractual, employment or other rights and any assertion of rights to own or
acquire any security.

Section 8.3 _Claim Procedures_.

  



  

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to duly make a valid claim under
_Section 8.2_, the Indemnified Party must (reasonably promptly following the
first date following the Closing Date on which such Indemnified Party has
knowledge of facts, matters or circumstances from which it is reasonably
apparent that such an occurrence is likely to have occurred) provide written
notice to the Majority Stockholder (the recipient of such notice, the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "), which notice shall set forth a description in
reasonable detail of the occurrence(s) specified in _Section 8.2_ which the
Indemnified Party alleges to have occurred, a description of the facts and
circumstances giving rise to such occurrences, the estimated amount of Losses
imposed, incurred, suffered or asserted in connection therewith or arising
therefrom (to the extent then ascertainable), and a description of any other
remedy sought in connection therewith, any relevant time constraints relating
thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining
thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ "). The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with
and provide to the Indemnifying Party such information under the Indemnified
Party's control as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request for the
purposes of determining the validity of the allegations made in the
Claim Notice and shall keep the Indemnifying Party reasonably and promptly
informed of factual and procedural developments (including additional
information which may come under the Indemnified Party's control) in
connection therewith. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential
information (consistent with applicable Law) to third parties and to cause
all communications among employees, counsel and others representing any
party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable
attorney-client or work product privileges.

  



  

(b) In the event the Claim Notice results from any Action asserted or
threatened against, the Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "):

  



  

(i) The Indemnified Party shall provide the Claim Notice to the Indemnifying
Party not later than the tenth (10th) Business Day following the Indemnified
Party's receipt of the Third Party Claim, and in any event not later than the
tenth (10th) Business Day preceding the date by which an appearance is
required to be made before a court, arbitrator or other tribunal or an answer
or similar pleading is required to be filed in a litigation or other
proceeding; _provided_ , _that_ if either such Business Day occurs on or
prior to the Closing Date, the Claim Notice shall be timely provided if it is
provided not later than the Business Day following the Closing Date; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that the failure to timely provide a Claim Notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder except
to the extent that such failure has a material prejudicial effect on the
defense or resolution of the Third Party Claim.

  



  

(ii) During the period ending on the earlier of the thirtieth (30th) calendar
day following the Indemnifying Party's receipt of the Claim Notice and the
fifth (5th) calendar day preceding the date on which an appearance is required
to be made before a court, arbitrator or other tribunal or an answer or
similar pleading is required to be filed in a litigation or other proceeding,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to notify the Indemnified Party of
its election to assume and control the defense of the Third Party Claim,
unless the Claim Notice states that the Indemnified Party has determined in
good faith that (1) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other
equitable or non-monetary relief against the Indemnified Party (other than
injunctive, equitable or non-monetary relief that is incidental to monetary
damages as the primary relief sought), (2) the Third Party Claim arises in
connection with any criminal matter, (3) the Losses sought in connection with
such Third Party Claim are reasonably likely to exceed the value of the then
outstanding number of Lockup Shares or (4) there is a reasonable probability
that the Third Party Claim may materially adversely affect the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages.

  



  

   

-60-

 



    



  

A. In the event that the Indemnifying Party is entitled to and duly and
timely makes such election, such election shall constitute the Indemnifying
Party's conclusive acknowledgment that the Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified, defended, held harmless and reimbursed in accordance with this
_Article VIII_ for, from and against the Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall
have the sole power (as between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party and their respective Affiliates) to direct and control such defense and
the settlement, arbitration, litigation and appellate strategy relating to
the Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled but not
obligated to participate in any such defense and to employ separate counsel
of its choosing for such purpose, in each case, at the Indemnified Party's
sole cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of
any such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to settle such
claims; _provided_ , _that_ , the Indemnifying Party shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle, compromise or offer
to settle, compromise or cease to defend such Third Party Claim if such
settlement, compromise or cessation would result in (i) any monetary
liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be promptly paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party; (ii) the imposition of a consent order,
injunction or decree that would materially restrict the future activity or
conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates; (iii) a finding or
admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates; (iv) a finding or admission
that would have an adverse effect on other claims made or threatened against
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates or (v) any non-monetary
condition or obligation being imposed on any Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates.

  



  

B. If the Indemnifying Party (i) is not entitled to or does not duly and
timely make such election, or (ii) after timely making such election, fails to
take reasonable steps to defend diligently the Third Party Claim within ten
(10) Business Days after its receipt of written notice from the
Indemnified Party to the effect that the Indemnifying Party has so failed,
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled but not obligated (subject to
_Section 8.6_ ( _Minimizing and Mitigating_ _Losses))_ to notify the
Indemnifying Party of its election to assume and control such defense from
the Indemnifying Party, whereupon the Indemnified Party and not the
Indemnifying Party shall have the powers described in the first sentence of
_Section 8.3(b)(ii)A_; _provided_ , _that_ the Indemnified Party's right to
be indemnified, defended, held harmless and reimbursed in respect of the Third
Party Claim shall not otherwise be affected by such election. Notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall have
no liability with respect to a Third Party Claim settled without its prior
written consent (which shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

  



  

   

-61-

 



    



  

(iii) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in
order to ensure the proper and adequate investigation and defense of all
Third Party Claims, including by providing reasonable access to each other's
relevant business records, documents and employees, for purposes of
investigation, document production, testimony and otherwise. The Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party shall keep each other fully and promptly
informed with respect to the status of all Third Party Claims and shall
deliver to each other copies of all material written notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the other that relate to any Third Party
Claims. The Person controlling the defense of a Third Party Claim shall in
good faith allow the Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, as the case may
be, to make comments to the materials filed or submitted in such defense, and
shall consider such comments in good faith.

  



  

(iv) All reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal fees, costs and
expenses actually incurred or suffered by the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party in connection with investigating and defending, and
cooperating in the investigation and defense of, the Third Party Claim ("
_Third Party Claim Expenses_ ") shall be paid as follows:

  



  

(v) Any Third Party Claim Expenses actually incurred or suffered by the
Indemnified Party (1) prior to or in the absence of the due and timely making
of the election described in _Section 8.3(b)(ii)A_, (2) under the
circumstances described in _Section 8.3(b)(ii)B_ or (3) in compliance with
_Section 8.3(b)(iii)_ shall constitute Losses for which the Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to be reimbursed if the Indemnified Party is determined
pursuant to a Final Determination to be entitled to be indemnified,
held harmless and reimbursed pursuant to this _Article VIII_ in respect of
the Third Party Claim.

  



  

(vi) Third Party Claim Expenses not addressed by _Section 8.3(b)(ii)A_ shall
be paid by the Person by which they were incurred.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Losses and Recoveries_.

  



  

(a) _Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any
insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by
or against any other Person, in each case relating to the matters described
in the Claim Notice shall be deducted, except to the extent that the
adjustment itself would excuse, exclude or limit the coverage of all or part
of such Loss. The Indemnified Party shall, use commercially reasonable
efforts (excluding litigation) to recover any such insurance or other
proceeds from third parties to the same extent such Indemnified Party would
recover such proceeds if such Losses were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. In the event that, after having complied with the preceding
sentence, an Indemnified Party still has any rights against a third party with
respect to any occurrence, claim or Loss that results in a payment by an
Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_, such Indemnifying Party shall
be subrogated to such rights to the extent of such payment; _provided_ ,
_that_ until the Indemnified Party recovers full payment of the Loss
associated with such payment, any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party
against any such third party on account of said indemnity payment are hereby
expressly made subordinate and subject in right of payment to the Indemnified
Party's rights against such third party. Each Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party shall duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably
necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation and subordination rights
detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims.

  



  

   

-62-

 



    



  

(b) _Taxes_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, there shall be deducted
an amount equal to any net Tax benefit actually realized (including the
utilization of a Tax loss or Tax credit carried forward) as a result of such
Loss by the Person claiming such Loss.

  



  

(c) _Reimbursement_. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third
party in respect of a Loss after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid
by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Article VIII_ the Indemnified
Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of
(i) the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus
the amount received from the third party in respect thereof, _less_ (ii) the
full amount of the Loss.

  



  

(d) _No Double Recovery_. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover
more than once in respect of the same Loss (notwithstanding that such Loss
may result from more than one of the occurrences specified in _Section 8.2_).

  



  

(e) _Effect of Waiver of Condition_. No Party's right to indemnification
pursuant to this _Article VIII_ shall be adversely affected by its waiver of
a condition to the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ unless such Party makes
clear by the terms of its waiver that it is foreclosing its right to
indemnification with respect to all Losses in connection with or arising
out of the facts and circumstances that are the subject of the waiver.

  



  

Section 8.5 _Payments; Limitations_.

  



  

(a) The Majority Stockholder shall transfer to Parent the amount of any Loss
for which he is liable pursuant to _Section 8.2_ in the form of such number
of outstanding Lockup Shares, with the number of such Lockup Shares calculated
by reference to the thirty (30) day trailing VWAP per share of Parent Class A
Common Stock as of the date of the submission of the notice of claim to
the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3_.

  



  

(b) The Majority Stockholder shall not have any liability pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ to the extent that the aggregate amount of such Losses
exceeds (i) prior to the second anniversary of Closing, the then outstanding
number of Lockup Shares and (ii) thereafter, the number of Lockup Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the second anniversary of Closing.

  



  

(c) All payments made by an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in
respect of any claim pursuant to _Section 8.2_ shall be treated as
adjustments to the consideration paid pursuant to the Transactions for Tax
purposes.

  



  

   

-63-

 



    



  

Section 8.6 _Minimizing and Mitigating Losses_. Each Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any indemnifiable Loss, and
if the Indemnified Party fails to do so, the Indemnifying Party shall have no
liability for any portion of such Loss that reasonably could have been
avoided had the Indemnified Party so complied.

  



  

Section 8.7 _Exclusive Remedies and No Rights Against Nonparties_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing, no Party shall assert against any other Party any
claim, cause of action, right or remedy, or any Action, relating to this
Agreement, the Transactions or any document or instrument delivered in
connection herewith or therewith, other than (i) claims pursuant to this
_Article VIII_, (ii) claims that a Party committed common law fraud under
Delaware Law in making any representation or warranty contained in _Articles
III_ or _IV_ and (iii) claims pursuant to the terms of any Transaction
Document. Following the Closing, the claims and remedies specified in clauses
(i) through (iii) of the previous sentence shall constitute the Parties' sole
and exclusive rights and remedies available to the Indemnified Parties for
any and all Losses or other claims relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Transactions and any document or instrument delivered in
connection herewith or therewith, and shall supersede all other rights and
remedies available at law or in equity (including any right of rescission).
Accordingly, effective as of the Closing, each Party hereby irrevocably waives
and discharges, and releases each other Party, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, from, all other claims, causes of action and
Actions relating thereto.

  



  

(b) In addition to _Section 8.7(a)_, this Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any Action, right or remedy that may be based upon, arise out of
or relate to this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or the
Transactions, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement,
may only be made against the Persons that are expressly identified as Parties
in their capacities as parties to this Agreement, and no Party shall at any
time assert against any Person (other than a Party) which is a director,
officer, employee, shareholder, general or limited partner, member, manager,
agent or Affiliate or Representative of another Party (each, a " _Nonparty_
"), any claim, cause of action, right or remedy, or any Action, relating to
this Agreement, any other Transaction Document, the Transactions or any
document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or therewith. Each
Party hereby waives and discharges any such claim, cause of action, right,
remedy and Action, and releases (and agrees to execute and deliver any
instrument necessary to effectuate the release of) each Nonparty therefrom.
The provisions of this _Section 8.7(b)_ are for the benefit of and shall be
enforceable by each Nonparty, which is an intended third-party beneficiary of
this _Section 8.7(b)_ and _Section 5.23 _( _Further Assurances_ ) in
connection herewith.

this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

  



  

(b) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall

importing any gender shall include all other genders and vice versa. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The
words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when
used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" shall not be
exclusive. Currency amounts referenced herein are in Dollars. Any capitalized
term used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall
have the meaning given to them as set forth in this Agreement. All accounting
terms used herein and not expressly defined herein shall have the meanings
given to them under GAAP. References to "written" or "in writing" include
documents in electronic form or transmission by email. A reference to any
Person includes such Person's successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in this

promulgated thereunder, in each case as amended, re-enacted, consolidated or
replaced from time to time and in the case of any such amendment, re-
enactment, consolidation or replacement, reference herein to a particular
provision shall be read as referring to such amended, re-enacted,
consolidated or replaced provision and shall also include, unless the context
otherwise requires, all applicable guidelines, bulletins or policies made in
connection therewith _provided_ , _that_ for purposes of any representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a specific
date, references to any Law shall be deemed to refer to such Law as amended
as of such date. Any agreement or instrument referred to herein means such
agreement or instrument as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including by waiver or consent and all attachments thereto and
instruments incorporated therein.

action must be taken hereunder on or by a day that is not a Business Day, then

Day.

  



  

(e) No specific provision, representation or warranty in this Agreement shall
limit the applicability of a more general provision, representation or
warranty in this Agreement.

  



  

(f) The Parties drafted this Agreement jointly through the exchange of drafts
hereof, so no presumption or burden of proof favoring or disfavoring any
Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) Neither the specification of any Dollar amount in any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item
in any Schedule is intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower
amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not material, and
no Party shall use the fact of setting forth of any such amount or the
inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between the Parties
as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein or
included in any Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Neither the specification of any item or matter in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of
any specific item in any Schedule is intended to imply that such item or
matter, or other items or matters, are or are not in the ordinary course of
business, and no Party shall use the fact of the setting forth or the
inclusion of any specific item or matter in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in any Schedule is or is not in the ordinary course of business
for purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Assignment_. The obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement are not assignable without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, which such Parties may withhold in their discretion. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Fulfillment of Obligations_. Any obligation of any Party under
this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents, which obligation is
performed, satisfied or fulfilled completely by an Affiliate of such Party,

B-3

 



    



  

(v) against any action, transaction or agreement that would, or would

Stockholder under this Agreement or any of the conditions to the consummation
of the Merger under the Merger Agreement not being fulfilled on a timely
basis, (B) prevent, delay or impair consummation of the Transactions or

(b) Any vote required to be cast or consent or dissent in writing required to
be expressed pursuant to this _Section 1.01_ shall be cast or expressed in
accordance with the applicable procedures relating thereto so as to ensure
that it is duly counted for purposes of determining that a quorum is present

each of them individually and with full power of substitution, as the

Stockholder's name, place and stead, to be counted as represented by proxy
and vote, at any time during the Applicable Period, each Subject Share as the
Stockholder's proxy, at every Meeting (including at any adjournment or
postponement thereof) and to execute and deliver on behalf of the Stockholder
any written expression of consent or dissent relating to the Subject Shares
in order to cause the Stockholder to perform the covenants set forth in
_Section 1.01_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Stockholder's grant of the
proxy and power of attorney contemplated by this _Section 1.02_ will be
effective with respect to a Meeting or Consent Solicitation if, and only if,
the Stockholder has not delivered or caused to be delivered to the Secretary
of the Company (or the Person undertaking the Consent Solicitation, as
applicable), at least two (2) Business Days' prior to the Meeting or deadline
for the Consent Solicitation, as applicable, a duly executed irrevocable
proxy directing that the Subject Shares be voted in accordance with _Section
1.01_ or a duly executed irrevocable expression of consent or dissent in
writing with respect to the Subject Shares in accordance with _Section 1.01_
, as applicable. The proxy described in this _Section 1.02_ , if it becomes
effective, is limited solely to the voting of Subject Shares (or expressing
consent or dissent in writing with respect thereto) solely in order to cause
the Stockholder to perform the covenants set forth in _Section 1.01_. The
Stockholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this
_Section 1.02_ , if it becomes effective, is given in connection with the
execution of the Merger Agreement and such irrevocable proxy is given to
secure the performance of the obligations of the Stockholder under this
Agreement. The proxy described in this _Section 1.02_ , if it becomes
effective, is coupled with an interest, including for the purposes of Section
212 of the DGCL, revokes all prior proxies granted by the Stockholder with
respect to the Subject Shares and is irrevocable, _provided _ that this proxy
shall automatically terminate at the Expiration Date. The power of attorney
granted by the Stockholder, if it becomes effective, is a durable power of
attorney and shall survive the bankruptcy, dissolution, death or incapacity
of the Stockholder. For Subject Shares as to which the Stockholder is the
beneficial owner but not the holder of record, the Stockholder shall cause
any holder of record of such Subject Shares to grant to Parent a proxy to the
same effect as that described in this  _Section 1.02_. Parent may terminate
this proxy with respect to the Stockholder at any time at its sole election by
written notice provided to the Stockholder.

shall not, directly or indirectly: (a) sell, convey, assign, transfer
(including by succession or otherwise by operation of Law), exchange, pledge,
hypothecate or otherwise encumber or dispose of any Subject Shares (or any
right, title or interest therein) or any rights to acquire any securities or

to acquire any securities or equity interests of the Company into a voting
trust or enter into a voting agreement or any other arrangement with respect

interests of the Company or, except as otherwise provided in _Section 1.02_ ,

thereto; (c) enter into any contract, option, call or other arrangement or
undertaking, whether or not in writing, with respect to the sale, conveyance,
assignment, transfer (including by succession or otherwise by operation of

limitation on the voting rights, of any Subject Shares (or any right, title

commit or agree to take any of the foregoing actions or discuss, negotiate or
make an offer or enter into a commitment, agreement, understanding or similar
arrangement to take any of the foregoing actions (any action described in

Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect during the

_Section 1.03_ shall prevent entry into or performance of any obligations
pursuant to the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement]2.

  



  

Section 1.04. _Stop Transfer_. The Stockholder shall not request that the
Company register any transfer of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share or other
uncertificated interest representing any Subject Shares made in violation of
the restrictions set forth in _Section 1.03_ during the Applicable Period and
hereby authorizes and instructs the Company to instruct its transfer agent to
enter a stop transfer order with respect to all of the Subject Shares, subject
to the provisions hereof; _provided_ , that any such stop transfer order will
immediately be withdrawn and terminated by the Company following the
termination of this Agreement.

entity, together with the Stockholder's officers, directors, stockholders,
Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of their respective heirs,
Representatives, successors and assigns (such persons, the " _Releasors_ "),

specified in this paragraph) releases, acquits and forever discharges, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, each of the Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
each of their subsidiaries and affiliates and their respective past, present
or future officers, directors, employees, counsel and agents, and all

"), from and against any and all liabilities, actions, causes of action,
claims, demands, damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind,
nature and description whatsoever, whether known or unknown, asserted or
unasserted, suspected or unsuspected, absolute or contingent, unmatured or
inchoate, both at law and in equity, which the Stockholder or any of the
Releasors ever had, now has or may hereafter have against any of the
Releasees, on or by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever that
arose prior to the Closing; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be
deemed to release (a) any right of the Stockholder to receive the Merger
Consideration or any cash in lieu of fractional shares to which it may be
entitled pursuant to the Merger Agreement in accordance with the terms
thereof, (b) any liabilities of a Releasee in connection with any future
transactions between the parties that are not related to the Merger
Agreements or the transactions contemplated thereby, (c) any employment
compensation or benefits matter affecting any Releasor in his or her capacity

hereunder, the Stockholder has received the advice of legal counsel with
regard to the releases contained herein, and having been so advised,

Releasors now know or believe to be true with respect to the subject matter of

herein given shall be and remain in full force and effect,
notwithstanding the discovery or existence of any such different or
additional facts.

Merger Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Merger Agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent

Stockholder in any capacity other than as a stockholder of the Company, to the

(c) otherwise restrict, limit or interfere with the performance of this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Merger Agreement. The Stockholder shall notify Parent in

seeking Appraisal Rights in connection with the Merger or (d) otherwise

that a Transfer by such transferor pursuant to this _Section 2.02(b)(ii)_
 shall only be permitted if a Transfer to such transferee would have been
permitted if the original Stockholder had been the transferor.

  



  

(c) _Transfers to Affiliates_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.01_ , each
Stockholder shall be permitted to Transfer from time to time any or all of
the Common Stock or BGL Warrants owned by such Stockholder to any of its
wholly-owned Subsidiaries or to a person or entity wholly owning such
Stockholder, so long as the applicable transferee executes a counterpart
signature page to this Agreement agreeing to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement applicable to such Stockholder.

  



  

Section 2.03 Miscellaneous Provisions Relating to Transfers

  



  

(a) _Legend_. In addition to any legends required by Applicable Law, each
certificate representing Common Stock shall bear a legend substantially in
the following form:

  



  

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO A Registration
Rights and Lockup AGREEMENT (A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF
PARENT). NO TRANSFER, SALE, ASSIGNMENT, PLEDGE, HYPOTHECATION OR OTHER
DISPOSITION OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE MADE
EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH AGREEMENT."

  



  

(b) _Prior Notice_. At least three (3) Business Days of prior notice shall be
given to Parent by the transferor of any Common Stock or BGL Warrants that is
subject to a Lockup Period but the Transfer of which is permitted by _Section
2.02(b)_ or _Section 2.02(c)_. Prior to the consummation of any such
permitted Transfer, or prior to any Transfer pursuant to which rights and
obligations of the transferor under this Agreement are assigned in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, the transferring Stockholder shall cause
the transferee to execute and deliver to Parent a Joinder Agreement and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall provide
any documents required by the Transfer Agent to consummate such Transfer. Upon
any Transfer by any Stockholder of any of its Common Stock or BGL Warrants,
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which is made in
conjunction with the assignment of such Stockholder's rights and obligations
hereunder, the transferee thereof shall be substituted for, and shall assume
all the rights and obligations under this Agreement, of the transferor
thereof.

  



  

(c) _Compliance with Laws_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each Stockholder agrees that it will not, directly or
indirectly, Transfer any of its Common Stock or BGL Warrants except as

(d) _Null and Void_. Any attempt to Transfer any Common Stock or BGL Warrants
that is not in compliance with this Agreement shall be null and void, and
Parent shall not, and shall cause any transfer agent not to, give any effect
in Parent's stock records to such attempted Transfer and the purported
transferee in any such purported Transfer shall not be treated as the owner of
such Common Stock or BGL Warrants for any purposes of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Removal of Legends_. In connection with the written request of a
Stockholder, Parent shall remove any restrictive legend included on the
certificates (or, in the case of book-entry shares, any other instrument or
record) representing such Stockholder's and/or its Affiliates' or permitted
transferee's ownership of Common Stock not subject to Article II hereof, and
Parent shall issue a certificate (or evidence of the issuance of securities
in book-entry form) without such restrictive legend or any other restrictive
legend to the holder of the applicable shares of Common Stock upon which it is
stamped, if (i) such shares of Common Stock are registered for resale under
the Securities Act and the registration statement for such shares of Common
Stock has not been suspended pursuant to Section 3.04 hereof or as otherwise
required by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations
of the SEC promulgated thereunder, or (ii) such shares of Common Stock are
sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144\. Following the earlier of (A) the
effective date of a Registration Statement registering such shares of Common
Stock or (B) Rule 144 becoming available for the resale of such shares of
Common Stock without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions, Parent, upon the
written request of the Stockholder or its permitted transferee and the
provision by such Person of an opinion of reputable counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Parent and the Transfer Agent, shall instruct the Transfer
Agent to remove the legend from such shares of Common Stock (in whatever
form) and shall cause Parent counsel to issue any legend removal opinion
required by the Transfer Agent. Any fees (with respect to the Transfer Agent,
Parent counsel, or otherwise) associated with the removal of such legend
(except for the provision of the legal opinion by the Stockholder or its
permitted transferee to the Transfer Agent referred to above) shall be borne
by Parent. If a legend is no longer required pursuant to the foregoing,
Parent will no later than five (5) Business Days following the delivery by
any Stockholder or its permitted transferee to Parent or the Transfer Agent
(with notice to Parent) of a legended certificate (if applicable) representing
such shares of Common Stock and, to the extent required, a seller
representation letter representing that such shares of Common Stock may be
sold pursuant to Rule 144, and a legal opinion of reputable counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Transfer Agent, deliver or cause to
be delivered to the holder of such Parent Equity Interests a certificate
representing such shares of Common Stock (or evidence of the issuance of such
shares of Common Stock in book-entry form) that is free from all restrictive
legends.

  



  

Section 2.04 Majority Stockholder Indemnification

  



  

(a) Subject to the limitations on liability set forth in the Merger
Agreement, if there is determined to be any Loss indemnifiable pursuant to
the Merger Agreement, Parent shall have recourse for such Loss from Lockup
Shares that are then held by the Majority Stockholder, and the Majority
Stockholder hereby agrees to transfer to Parent the amount of outstanding
Lockup Shares for which the Majority Stockholder is liable pursuant to the
_Section 8.2_ of the Merger Agreement.

Article III. 
 Registration rights

  



  

Section 3.01 Registration Statement

  



  

(a) _Filing_. Within forty-five (45) days after the date of the consummation
of the Merger (the " _Filing Deadline_ "), Parent shall file with the SEC (at
Parent's sole cost and expense) a Registration Statement registering the
resale of the Registrable Securities, and Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective as
soon as practicable after the filing thereof, but no later than the 60th
calendar day (or 120th calendar day if the SEC notifies Parent that it will
"review" any or all of the Registration Statement) following the Filing
Deadline (such date, the " _Effectiveness Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent's obligations to include the Registrable Securities held by any
Stockholder in the Registration Statement are contingent upon such Stockholder
furnishing in writing to Parent such information regarding such Stockholder,
the securities of Parent held by such Stockholder and the intended method of
disposition of the Registrable Securities as shall be reasonably requested by
Parent to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities, and shall
execute such documents in connection with such registration as Parent may
reasonably request that are customary of a selling stockholder in similar
situations.

  



  

(b) _Effectiveness_. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the continuous effectiveness of the Registration Statement until the
earliest of (i) the date on which the all Registerable Securities may be
resold without volume or manner of sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144,
(ii) the date on which such Registerable Securities have actually been sold
and (iii) the date which is two (2) years after the consummation of the
Merger. For purposes of clarification, any failure by Parent to file the
Registration Statement by the Filing Deadline or to effect such Registration
by the Effectiveness Date shall not otherwise relieve Parent of its
obligations to file or effect the Registration Statement set forth in this
_Section 3.01_.

  



  

(c) _Delay_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Parent shall be entitled to delay or postpone the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, and from time to time to require any Stockholder not
to sell under the Registration Statement or to suspend the effectiveness
thereof, if Adverse Disclosure would be required (each such circumstance, a "
_Suspension Event_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may not delay or
suspend the Registration Statement on more than two occasions or for more
than sixty (60) consecutive calendar days per occasion, or more than one
hundred and twenty (120) total calendar days, during any twelve (12)-month
period. Upon receipt of any written notice from Parent of the happening of any
Suspension Event (which notice shall not contain material non-public
information) during the period that the Registration Statement is effective or
if as a result of a Suspension Event the Registration Statement or related
Prospectus contains a Misstatement, each Stockholder agrees that (i) such
Stockholder will immediately discontinue offers and sales of the Common Stock
under the Registration Statement (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt,
sales conducted pursuant to Rule 144) until such Stockholder receives copies
of a supplemental or amended Prospectus (which Parent agrees to promptly
prepare) that corrects the misstatement(s) or omission(s) referred to above
and receives written notice from Parent that such Stockholder may resume such
offers and sales, and (ii) such Stockholder will maintain the confidentiality
of any information included in such written notice delivered by Parent unless
otherwise required by Applicable Law or subpoena. If so directed by Parent,
each Stockholder will deliver to Parent or, in such Stockholder's sole
discretion destroy, all copies of the Prospectus covering the Common Stock in
such Stockholder's possession; _provided_ , _however_ , that this obligation
to deliver or destroy all copies of the Prospectus covering the Common Stock
shall not apply (i) to the extent such Stockholder is required to retain a
copy of such Prospectus (1) to comply with applicable legal, regulatory, self-
regulatory or professional requirements or (2) in accordance with a bona fide
pre-existing document retention policy or (ii) to copies stored
electronically on archival servers as a result of automatic data back-up.

Section 3.02 Underwritten Offering.

  



  

(a) _Right to Underwritten Offerings_. Subject to the conditions of this
_Section 3.02_ , any Stockholder may, by providing written notice to Parent,
request to sell all or part of its Registrable Securities that are registered
by the Registration Statement contemplated by Section 3.01 and not subject to
_Article II_ hereof (any such Stockholder a " _Demanding Holder_ "
and, collectively, the " _Demanding Holders_ ") in an Underwritten Offering.
Each request for an Underwritten Offering (a " _Underwritten Offering
Request_ ") shall specify the number of Registrable Securities intended to be
offered and sold by such Stockholder pursuant to the Underwritten Offering.
Promptly (but in any event within ten (10) days) after receipt of an
Underwritten Offering Request, Parent shall give written notice of the
Underwritten Offering Request to all other Stockholders. Such notice shall
offer such Stockholders the opportunity to include in the Underwritten
Offering such number of Registrable Securities as each such Stockholder may
request. Each such Stockholder shall make such request in writing to Parent
within five (5) Business Days after the receipt of any such notice from
Parent. Parent shall not be required to effect an Underwritten Offering unless
the reasonably expected aggregate gross proceeds from the offering of the
Registrable Securities to be registered in connection with such Underwritten
Offering are at least $75,000,000 (the " _Minimum Amount_ ") and shall not be
required to effect an underwritten offering pursuant to an Underwritten
Offering within ninety (90) days of the completion of a previous
Underwritten Offering.

  



  

(b) _Selection of Underwriters and Number of Registrations_. Parent shall,
upon receipt of such Underwritten Offering Request, enter into
an underwriting agreement in a form as is customary in Underwritten Offerings
of equity securities with the managing Underwriter or Underwriters selected
by Parent after consultation with the Demanding Holders and shall take all
such other reasonable actions as are requested by the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall have no obligation to
facilitate or participate in more than two (2) Underwritten Offerings
pursuant to this _Section 3.02_ for any Stockholder (and not more than four
(4) Underwritten Offerings for all Stockholders in the aggregate) (the "
_Underwritten Offerings Cap_ "); _provided further_ that if an Underwritten
Offering is commenced but terminated prior to the pricing thereof for any
reason, such Underwritten Offering will not be counted as an
Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section 3.02_.

  



  

   

C-13

 



    



  

(c) _Underwriting Agreement_. In connection with any Underwritten Offering
contemplated by this _Section 3.02_ , the underwriting agreement into which
each Demanding Holder, any participating Stockholder and Parent shall enter
shall contain such representations, covenants, indemnities (subject to
_Article V_ ) and other rights and obligations as are customary in
underwritten offerings of equity securities. If requested by the Underwriters
in connection with any Underwritten Offering, any Stockholder that holds
Registrable Securities and has the right to participate in such Underwritten
Offering pursuant to _Section 3.02(a)_ (other than those Stockholders who are
not participating in the Underwritten Offering and who together with such
Stockholder's Affiliates "beneficially own" (as such term is defined under
and determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) less than 3.0%
of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Stock) shall enter into a
customary lockup agreement in connection therewith not to exceed ninety (90)
days from the pricing of such Underwritten Offering.

  



  

(d) _Reduction of Underwritten Offering._ If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering, in good faith, advises Parent, the
Demanding Holders and other participating Stockholders that the dollar amount
or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders desire to
sell, taken together with all Common Stock or other equity securities that
Parent or any other Stockholder desires to sell and the shares of Common
Stock, if any, as to which a Registration has been requested pursuant to
separate written contractual piggy-back registration rights held by any other
stockholders who desire to sell, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum
number of equity securities that can be sold in the Underwritten Offering
without adversely affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the
distribution method, or the probability of success of such offering (such
maximum dollar amount or maximum number of such securities, as applicable,
the " _Maximum Number of Securities_ "), then Parent shall include in such
Underwritten Offering, as follows:

  



  

i. _first_ , the Registrable Securities of the Demanding Holders and other
participating Stockholders pro rata based on the respective number of
Registrable Securities that each Demanding Holder and participating
Stockholder has requested be included in such Underwritten Offering and the
aggregate number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders and
participating Stockholders have requested be included in such Underwritten
Offering that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;

  



  

ii. _second_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (i), Common Stock or other equity
securities that Parent desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Securities; and

  



  

iii. _third_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (i) and clause (ii), Common Stock or
other equity securities of persons or entities that Parent is obligated to
register in a Registration pursuant to separate written contractual
arrangements with such persons, pro rata, which can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

(e) Each Demanding Holder and participating Stockholder shall have the right
to withdraw all or any portion of its Registrable Securities included in an
Underwritten Offering pursuant to this _Section 3.02_ for any or no reason
whatsoever upon written notification to Parent and the Underwriter or
Underwriters of its intention to withdraw from such Underwritten Offering
prior to the public announcement of such Underwritten Offering and, in the
case of the Demanding Holder that withdraws all of its Registrable
Securities, it shall no longer be considered an Underwritten Offering for
purposes of the Underwritten Offerings Cap for that Demanding Holder; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that upon the withdrawal of an amount of Registrable
Securities that results in the remaining amount of Registrable Securities
included by the Demanding Holders and participating Stockholders in such
Underwritten Offering being less than the Minimum Amount, Parent may cease
all efforts to complete the Underwritten Offering and, for the avoidance
of doubt, if such efforts are ceased, such Underwritten Offering shall not
count against the Underwritten Offerings Cap, in the aggregate or for any
Stockholder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
Parent shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in
connection with an Underwritten Offering prior to its withdrawal under this
_Section 3.02_.

Section 3.03 Piggyback Registration Rights.

  



  

(a) If at any time Parent proposes to file a registration statement under the
Securities Act with respect to an Underwritten Offering of equity securities,
or securities or other obligations exercisable or exchangeable for, or
convertible into equity securities, for its own account or for the account of
stockholders of Parent on a form that would permit registration of Registrable
Securities, other than a registration statement (i) filed in connection with
any employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer
or offering of securities solely to the Stockholders, (iii) for an offering of
debt that is convertible into equity securities of Parent, (iv) for a
dividend reinvestment plan or (v) on Form S-4, then Parent shall give written
notice of such proposed filing to all of the Stockholders as soon as
practicable but not less than ten (10) days before the anticipated filing date
of such registration statement, which notice shall (A) describe the amount
and type of securities to be included in such offering, the intended
method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed managing Underwriter
or Underwriters, if any, in such offering, and (B) offer to all of the
Stockholders the opportunity to register the sale of such number of
Registrable Securities as such Stockholders may request in writing within
five (5) days after receipt of such written notice (in the case of an
"overnight" or "bought" offering, such requests must be made by the
Stockholders within one (1) Business Day after the delivery of any such notice
by Parent) (such Registration a " _Piggyback Registration_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if Parent has been advised by the managing Underwriter(s)
that the inclusion of Registrable Securities for sale for the benefit of the
Stockholders will have an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution
of the Common Stock in the Underwritten Offering, then (A) if no Registrable
Securities can be included in the Underwritten Offering in the opinion of the
managing Underwriter(s), Parent shall not be required to offer such
opportunity to the Stockholders or (B) if any Registrable Securities can be
included in the Underwritten Offering in the opinion of the managing
Underwriter(s), then the amount of Registrable Securities to be offered for
the accounts of Stockholders shall be determined based on the provisions of
this _Section 3.03_.

  



  

(b) Subject to this _Section 3.03_ , Parent shall, in good faith, cause such
Registrable Securities to be included in such Piggyback Registration and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the managing
Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to permit the
Registrable Securities requested by the Stockholders pursuant to this _Section
3.03_ to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same terms and
conditions as any similar securities of Parent included in such
Registration and to permit the sale or other disposition of such Registrable
Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of distribution thereof.
If no written request for inclusion from a Stockholder is received within the
specified time, each such Stockholder shall have no further right to
participate in such Underwritten Offering. All such Stockholders proposing to
distribute their Registrable Securities through an Underwritten Offering
under this _Section 3.03_ shall enter into an underwriting agreement in
customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwritten
Offering by Parent.

  



  

   

C-15

 



    



  

(c) If the managing Underwriter or Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering
that is to be a Piggyback Registration, in good faith, advises Parent and the
Stockholders participating in the Piggyback Registration that the dollar
amount or number of shares of Common Stock that Parent desires to sell, taken
together with (i) the shares of Common Stock, if any, as to which Registration
has been demanded pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements with
persons or entities other than the Stockholders hereunder, (ii)
the Registrable Securities as to which registration has been requested
pursuant to this _Section3.03_ , and (iii) the shares of Common Stock, if
any, as to which Registration has been requested pursuant to separate written
contractual piggy-back registration rights of other stockholders of Parent,
exceeds the Maximum Number of Securities, then:

  



  

i. If the Registration is undertaken for Parent's account, Parent shall
include in any such Registration:

  



  

(A) _first_ , shares of Common Stock or other equity securities that Parent
desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities;

  



  

(B) _second_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (A), pro rata to (i) the
Registrable Securities of Stockholders exercising their rights to register
their Registrable Securities pursuant to this _Section 3.03_  and (ii) shares
of Common Stock or other equity securities, if any, as to which Registration
has been requested pursuant to written contractual piggy-back registration
rights of other stockholders of Parent, which can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Securities;

  



  

ii. If the Registration is pursuant to a demand by persons or entities other
than the Stockholders pursuant to separate written contractual arrangements,
then Parent shall include in any such Registration:

  



  

(A) _first_ , shares of Common Stock or other equity securities, if any, of
such requesting persons or entities, other than the Stockholders, which can
be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;

  



  

(B) _second_ , to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not
been reached under the foregoing clause (A), pro rata to (i) the
Registrable Securities of Stockholders exercising their rights to register
their Registrable Securities pursuant to this _Section 3.03_ , (ii) shares of
Common Stock or other equity securities that Parent desires to sell, and (iii)
shares of Common Stock or other equity securities for the account of other
persons or entities that Parent is obligated to register pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such persons or entities, which can be
sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

  



  

   

C-16

 



    



  

iii. Any Stockholder shall have the right to withdraw from a Piggyback
Registration for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification to
Parent and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of its intention to
withdraw from such Piggyback Registration prior to the public announcement of
such Underwritten Offering. Parent (whether on its own good faith
determination or as the result of a request for withdrawal by persons
pursuant to separate written contractual obligations) may withdraw a
Registration Statement filed with the SEC in connection with a Piggyback
Registration at any time prior to the effectiveness of such Registration
Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent
shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection
with the Piggyback Registration prior to its withdrawal under this _Section
3.03_.

  



  

(d) For purposes of clarity, any Registration effected pursuant to _Section
3.03_ hereof shall not be counted as a Registration effected under _Section
3.02_ hereof.

  



  

Section 3.04 Parent Procedures.

  



  

(a) _General Procedures_. If and whenever Parent is required to effect the
registration of any Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, Parent

earlier) in accordance with the intended plan of distribution set forth in
such Registration Statement or supplement to the Prospectus;

  



  

ii. prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment
or supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the Underwriters, if any,

Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein), the Prospectus included in such
Registration (including each preliminary Prospectus), and such other
documents as the Underwriters and the Stockholders included in such
Registration or the legal counsel for any such Stockholders may request in

intended plan of distribution) may request and (ii) take such action
necessary to cause such Registrable Securities covered by the Registration
Statement to be registered with or approved by such other Governmental
Authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of
Parent and do any and all other acts and things that may be necessary or
advisable to enable the Stockholders included in such Registration Statement
to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to

any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order should be
issued;

  



  

vii. at least two (2) days prior to the filing of any Registration Statement
or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement

then to correct such Misstatement as set forth in _Section 3.04(d)_ hereof;

  



  

ix. permit a representative of the Stockholders (such representative to be
selected by a majority of the participating Stockholders), the Underwriters,
if any, and any attorney or accountant retained by such Stockholders or
Underwriter to participate, at each such person's own expense, in the
preparation of the Registration Statement, and cause Parent's officers,
directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any
such representative, Underwriter, attorney or accountant in connection with
the Registration; _provided_ , _however_ , that such representatives or
Underwriters enter into a confidentiality agreement, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, prior to the release or disclosure of any
such information; and provided further, Parent may not include the name of
any Stockholder or Underwriter or any information regarding any
Stockholder or Underwriter in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, any
amendment or supplement to such Registration Statement or Prospectus, any
document that is to be incorporated by reference into such Registration
Statement or Prospectus, or any response to any comment letter, without the
prior written consent of such Stockholder or Underwriter and providing each
such Stockholder or Underwriter a reasonable amount of time to review and
comment on such applicable document, which comments Parent shall include
unless contrary to Applicable Law;

  



  

   

C-18

 



    



  

x. obtain a "cold comfort" letter (including any necessary "bring-down cold
comfort letter" as may be required or requested by any Underwriter on the
date any Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant to
Registration) from Parent's independent registered public accountants in the
event of an Underwritten Offering which the participating Stockholders may
rely on, in customary form and covering such matters of the type customarily
covered by "cold comfort" letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably
request, and reasonably satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the
participating Stockholders;

  



  

xi. on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant to
such Registration, obtain an opinion, dated such date, of counsel
representing Parent for the purposes of such Registration, addressed to the

thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the SEC);

  



  

xiv. if the Registration involves the Registration of Registrable Securities
in an Underwritten Offering in excess of the Minimum Amount, use its
reasonable efforts to make available senior executives of Parent to
participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be reasonably
requested by the Underwriter in any Underwritten Offering; and

  



  

xv. otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such
customary actions as may reasonably be requested by the Stockholders,
in connection with such Registration.

  



  

   

C-19

 



    



  

(b) _Registration Expenses_. The Registration Expenses of all Registrations
shall be borne by Parent. It is acknowledged by the Stockholders that the
Stockholders shall bear all incremental selling expenses relating to the sale
of Registrable Securities, such as Underwriters' commissions and discounts,
brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs and, other than as set forth in
the definition of " _Registration Expenses_ ," all reasonable fees and
expenses of any legal counsel representing the Stockholders.

  



  

(c) _Requirements for Participation in Underwritten Offerings_. No person may
participate in any Underwritten Offering for equity securities of Parent
pursuant to a Registration initiated by Parent hereunder unless such person
(i) agrees to sell such person's securities on the basis provided in any
underwriting arrangements approved by Parent and (ii) completes and executes
all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, lockup
agreements, underwriting agreements and other customary documents as may be
reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

  



  

(d) _Suspension of Sales ; Adverse Disclosure_. Upon receipt of written
notice from Parent that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains a
Misstatement, each of the Stockholders shall forthwith discontinue disposition
of Registrable Securities until he, she or it has received copies of a
supplemented or amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (it being
understood that Parent hereby covenants to prepare and file such supplement
or amendment as soon as practicable after the time of such notice), or until
he, she or it is advised in writing by Parent that the use of the Prospectus
may be resumed (any such period, a " _Suspension Period_ "). If the filing,
initial effectiveness or continued use of a Registration Statement in respect
of any Registration at any time would require Parent to make an Adverse
Disclosure or would require the inclusion in such Registration Statement
of financial statements that are unavailable to Parent for reasons beyond
Parent's control, Parent may, upon giving prompt written notice of such
action to the Holders, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of, or
suspend use of, such Registration Statement for the shortest period of time
determined in good faith by Parent to be necessary for such purpose (any such
period, a " _Blackout Period_ "). In the event Parent exercises its rights
under the preceding sentence, the Stockholders agree to suspend,
immediately upon their receipt of the notice referred to above, their use of
the Prospectus relating to any Registration in connection with any sale or
offer to sell Registrable Securities. Parent shall immediately notify the
Stockholders of the expiration of any period during which it exercised its
rights under this Section 3.04(d). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 3.04, in no event shall any Suspension Period or any Blackout
Period continue for more than ninety (90) days in the aggregate during any
365-day period.

  



  

(e) _Reporting Obligations_. As long as any Stockholder shall own Registrable
Securities, Parent, at all times while it shall be a reporting company under
the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions in respect
thereof and file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to
be filed by Parent after the Effective Date pursuant to Sections 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly furnish the Stockholders with true
and complete copies of all such filings. Parent further covenants that
it shall take such further action as any Stockholder may reasonably request,
all to the extent required from time to time to enable such Stockholder to
sell shares of Common Stock held by such Stockholder without registration
under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by
Rule 144, including providing any legal opinions. Upon the request of any
Stockholder, Parent shall deliver to such Stockholder a written certification
of a duly authorized officer as to whether Parent has complied with such
requirements.

  



  

   

C-20

 



    



  

Section 3.05 Indemnification and Contribution

  



  

(a) Parent agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each
Stockholder, its officers and directors and each person who controls such
Stockholder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees) caused
by any Misstatement or alleged Misstatement, except insofar as the such
Misstatement or alleged Misstatement caused by or contained in any
information furnished in writing to Parent by such Stockholder expressly for
use in such Registration Statement or Prospectus. Parent shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and each person who controls
such Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same
extent as provided in the foregoing with respect to the indemnification of
the Stockholder.

  



  

(b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Stockholder is
participating, such Stockholder shall furnish to Parent in writing such
information and affidavits as Parent reasonably requests for use in connection
with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus and, to the extent
permitted by law, shall indemnify Parent, its directors and officers and
agents and each person who controls Parent (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from any
Misstatement, but only to the extent that such Misstatement is contained in
any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by such Stockholder
expressly for use in such Registration Statement or Prospectus; provided,
however, that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and
several, among such Stockholders holding Registrable Securities, and the
liability of each such Stockholder holding Registrable Securities shall be in
proportion to and limited to the net proceeds received by such Stockholder
from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration
Statement. The Stockholders shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers,
directors and each person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning
of the Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing with
respect to indemnification of Parent.

  



  

(c) Any person entitled to indemnification herein shall (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification ( _provided_. that the failure to give prompt notice
shall not impair any person's right to indemnification hereunder to the
extent such failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and
(ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable judgment a conflict of
interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with
respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying party to assume the defense of
such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If
such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any
liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of
more than one counsel (plus local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such
indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable
judgment of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between
such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with respect
to such claim. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement which cannot be settled in all respects by the payment of money
(and such money is so paid by the indemnifying party pursuant to the terms of
such settlement) or which settlement does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified
party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

  



  

   

C-21

 



    



  

(d) The indemnification provided for under this _Article III_ shall remain in
full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of
the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling person of such
indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of securities. Parent and
each Stockholder participating in an offering also agrees to make such
provisions as are reasonably requested by any indemnified party for
contribution to such party in the event Parent's or such
Stockholder's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

  



  

(e) If the indemnification provided under _Section 3.05_ hereof from the
indemnifying party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying the indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by the indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party, as
well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact, was made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the indemnifying party's
and indemnified party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the liability of any Stockholder under this _Section 3.05(e)_  shall be
limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such Stockholder in such
offering giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or payable by a party
as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to above shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in _Sections 3.05(a)_
, _(b)_ and _(c)_ above, any legal or other fees, charges or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or
proceeding. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this subsection _Section 3.05(e)_ were determined
by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not
take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this  _Section
3.05(e)_. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution
pursuant to this _Section 3.05(e)_ from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation.

and relative, participating, optional, special and other rights, if any, of

the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board.

  



  

(b) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, the Board shall be divided into three
classes, as nearly equal in number as possible and designated Class I, Class
II and Class III. The Board is authorized to assign members of the Board
already in office to Class I, Class II or Class III. The term of the initial
Class I Directors shall expire at the first annual meeting of the stockholders
of the Corporation following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate; the term of the initial Class II Directors shall
expire at the second annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation
following the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate;
and the term of the initial Class III Directors shall expire at the third
annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following the
effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate. At each
succeeding annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, beginning
with the first annual meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation following
the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate, each of
the successors elected to replace the class of directors whose term
expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a three-year term or
until the election and qualification of their respective successors in
office, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Subject to
_Section 5.5_ hereof, if the number of directors that constitute the Board
is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among
the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly
equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors
constituting the Board shorten the term of any incumbent director. Subject to
the rights of the holders of one or more series of Preferred Stock, voting
separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one
or more series of Preferred Stock, the election of directors shall be
determined. Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by
the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and
entitled to vote thereon. The Board is hereby expressly authorized, by
resolution or resolutions thereof, to assign members of the Board already in
office to the aforesaid classes at the time this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (and therefore such classification) becomes effective in
accordance with the DGCL.

(c) Subject to _Section 5.5_ hereof, a director shall hold office until the
annual meeting for the year in which his or her term expires and until his or
her successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such
director's earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or
removal.

  



  

(d) Unless and except to the extent that the Bylaws shall so require, the
election of directors need not be by written ballot. The holders of shares of
Common Stock shall not have cumulative voting rights.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to Section
5.5 hereof, newly created directorships resulting from an increase in the
number of directors and any vacancies on the Board resulting from death,
resignation, retirement, disqualification, removal or other cause may be
filled solely and exclusively by a majority vote of the remaining directors
then in office, even if less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director
(and not by stockholders), and any director so chosen shall hold office for
the remainder of the full term of the class of directors to which the new
directorship was added or in which the vacancy occurred and until his or her
successor has been elected and qualified, subject, however, to such director's
earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Removal_. Subject to Section 5.5 hereof, any or all of the
directors may be removed from office at any time, but only for cause and only
by the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power of all
then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Preferred Stock - Directors_. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this _Article V_, and except as otherwise required by law,
whenever the holders of one or more series of the Preferred Stock shall have
the right, voting separately by class or series, to elect one or
more directors, the term of office, the filling of vacancies, the removal
from office and other features of such directorships shall be governed by the
terms of such series of the Preferred Stock as set forth in this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation)
and such directors shall not be included in any of the classes created
pursuant to this _Article V _unless expressly provided by such terms.

  



  

Article VI 
 BYLAWS

  



  

In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred upon it by law,
the Board shall have the power and is expressly authorized to adopt, amend,
alter or repeal the Bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total
number of directors present at a regular or special meeting of the Board at
which there is a quorum or by unanimous written consent. The Bylaws also may
be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided,
however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of
capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of
all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, shall be required for the stockholders of the Corporation to adopt,
amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no
Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders of the Corporation shall
invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such
Bylaws had not been adopted.

Article VII 
 SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT

  



  

Section 7.1 _Special Meetings_. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders
of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the requirements of
applicable law, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be
called only by a Chairman of the Board, a Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of
the Board, and the ability of the stockholders of the Corporation to call a
special meeting is hereby specifically denied. Except as provided in the
foregoing sentence, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may
not be called by another person or persons.

  



  

Section 7.2 _Advance Notice_. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for
the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before
any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the
manner provided in the Bylaws.

  



  

Section 7.3 _Action by Written Consent_. Except as may be otherwise provided
for or fixed pursuant to this Second Amended and Restated Certificate
(including any Preferred Stock Designation) relating to the rights of the
holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock, any action required
or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be
effected by a duly called annual or special meeting of such stockholders and
may not be effected by written consent of the stockholders.

  



  

Article VIII 
 LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

Section 8.1 _Limitation of Director Liability_. A director of the Corporation
shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the
extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted
under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If the DGCL is
amended after the effectiveness of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the
liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation
shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the
DGCL, as so amended. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing
sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of
the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to
the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.

  



  

   

D-6

 



    



  

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

  



  

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or
may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to
or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit
or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "
_proceeding_ ") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or
officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an " _indemnitee_
"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and
amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in
connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent
not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, to
the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of
the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts
so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not
entitled to be indemnified under this _Section 8.2_ or otherwise. The rights
to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this _Section
8.2_ shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.2(a)_, except
for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of
expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an
indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such
indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
Board.

  



  

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any indemnitee by this _Section 8.2_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Second Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

  



  

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.2_ by the stockholders of the
Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this _Section
8.2_, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to
the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior
thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or
protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of
such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when
such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of,
or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

  



  

(d) This  _Section 8.2_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the
extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to
advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.

reserved in this _Article IX_.

(a) Subject to _Section 10.1(b)_, unless the Corporation consents in writing
to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the sole and exclusive forum for any internal or intra-corporate claim or
any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine as
defined by the laws of the State of Delaware, including, but not limited to:
(i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Corporation;
(ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any
director, officer or other employee or stockholder of the Corporation to the
Corporation or the Corporation's stockholders; or (iii) any action asserting
a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate or the Bylaws (in each case, as they may be amended
from time to time), or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware, shall be a state court located within
the State of Delaware (or, if no court located within the State of Delaware
has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware).

  



  

(b) Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the selection of an
alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and
exclusive forum for any action asserting a cause of action arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder (in
each case, as amended) shall be the federal district court for the District of
Delaware (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction over such action, any
other federal district court of the United States); provided, however,
that if the foregoing provisions of this _Section 10.1(b)_ are, or the
application of such provisions to any person or entity or any circumstance
is, illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the sole and exclusive forum for any
action asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933
or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder (in each case, as amended)
shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Second Amended and
Restated Certificate, the foregoing provisions of this _Section 10.1_ shall
not apply to any action seeking to enforce any liability, obligation or duty
created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any rule or regulation
promulgated thereunder (in each case, as amended).

  



  

(d) To the fullest extent permitted by law, any person or entity purchasing
or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of capital stock of
the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the
provisions of this _Section 10.1_.

  



  

Article XI 
 SEVERABILITY

  



  

If any provision or provisions (or any part thereof) of this Second Amended
and Restated Certificate shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable
as applied to any person or entity or circumstance for any reason whatsoever,
then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i) the validity, legality and
enforceability of such provisions in any other circumstance and of the
remaining provisions of this Second Amended and Restated Certificate
(including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of this Second
Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is not itself held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable) and the application of such provision to other
persons or entities and circumstances shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby, and (ii) the provisions of this Second Amended and Restated
Certificate (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph of
this Second Amended and Restated Certificate containing any such provision
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to
permit the Corporation to protect its directors, officers, employees and
agents from personal liability in respect of their good faith service or for
the benefit of the Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by law.

stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting.

  



  

Section 1.3. _Notice of Meetings_.

  



  

(a) Whenever stockholders of the Corporation are required or permitted to
take any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given
stating the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of remote
communications, if any, by which stockholders of the Corporation and
proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting,

(b) In addition, if a stockholder of the Corporation has consented to receive
notices by a form of electronic transmission, then, so long as such consent
has not been properly revoked by such stockholder or deemed revoked pursuant
to Section 232(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as
may be amended from time to time (the " _DGCL_ "), such notice, by (i)

and regulations promulgated thereunder, in each case as may be amended from

(a) Subject to applicable law, any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation, annual or special, may be adjourned from time to time, to
reconvene at the same or some other place, if any, thereof, and the means of
remote communications, if any, and notice need not be given of any such
adjourned meeting if the time and place and/or means of remote communication
(as applicable) thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment
is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business
that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty days, or if after the adjournment a new record date
is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be

otherwise provided by applicable law or the certificate of incorporation, as

entitled to vote on a matter at the meeting, present in person or represented
by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. In the absence of a quorum of
the holders of any class of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote on a
matter, either (i) the holders of such class so present or represented may,
by majority vote, adjourn the meeting of such class from time to time in the
manner provided by Section 1.4(b) of these Bylaws until a quorum of such
class shall be so present or represented or (ii) the chairperson of the
meeting may on his or her own motion adjourn the meeting from time to time in
the manner provided by Section 1.4(b) of these Bylaws until a quorum of such
class shall be so present and represented without the approval of the

proxy and entitled to vote, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting.

  



  

(b) Shares of the Corporation's own capital stock belonging on the record
date for determining stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote at the
meeting to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the
shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other
corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither
be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the
Corporation to vote stock, including but not limited to its own stock, held
by it in a fiduciary capacity.

  



  

Section 1.6. _Organization_. Meetings of stockholders of the Corporation
shall be presided over by the Chair, if any, or, in the absence of the Chair

right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to
do all such acts and things as are necessary or desirable for the proper
conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, the establishment of
procedures for the maintenance of order and safety, limitations on the time
allotted to questions or comments on the affairs of the Corporation,

Section 1.7. _Voting; Proxies_.

Corporation entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock of
the Corporation held by such stockholder who has voting power upon the matter
in question.

  



  

(b) Each stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation or to express consent or dissent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to
act for such stockholder by proxy but no such proxy shall be voted or acted
upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer
period.

  



  

(c) A duly executed proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is
irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest
sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power, regardless of whether the
interest with which it is coupled is an interest in the stock itself or an
interest in the Corporation generally; _provided_ , _however_ , that a
stockholder of the Corporation may revoke any proxy that is not irrevocable
by attending the meeting and voting in person or by filing an instrument in
writing revoking the proxy or another duly executed proxy bearing a later
date with the Secretary. Voting at meetings of stockholders of the
Corporation need not be by written ballot and need not be conducted by
inspectors unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of all
classes of stock of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon present in person
or represented by proxy at such meeting shall so determine.

  



  

(d) Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares of

otherwise provided by applicable law or by the Charter or these Bylaws, the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of the Corporation
present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote
on the subject matter shall be the act of the stockholders of the Corporation.

  



  

Section 1.8. _Fixing Date for Determination of Stockholders of Record_.

  



  

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders of the
Corporation entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders of the
Corporation or any adjournment thereof or, if necessary, any postponement
thereof effected pursuant to Section 1.4(b) of these Bylaws, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty nor less than
ten days before the date of such meeting. If the Board of Directors so fixes
a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the
stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting unless the
Board of Directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a
later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making
such determination. If no record date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the
record date for determining stockholders of the Corporation entitled to
notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders of the Corporation shall
be at the close of business in the State of Delaware on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the
close of business in the State of Delaware on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of the
Corporation of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting
or, if necessary, any postponement of the meeting effected pursuant to
Section 1.4(b) of these Bylaws; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board of
Directors may fix a new record date for determination of stockholders of the
Corporation entitled to vote at the adjourned or, if necessary, any postponed
meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders
of the Corporation entitled to notice of such adjourned or postponed meeting
the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of
stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this Section 1.8 at the adjourned or
postponed meeting.

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders of the
Corporation entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors, and which date shall not be more than ten
days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is
adopted by the Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the
Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders of the
Corporation entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is required by
applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent
setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware,
its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation
having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders
of the Corporation are recorded. Delivery made to the
Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been
fixed by the Board of Directors and prior action by the Board of Directors is
required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders of
the Corporation entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

  



  

(c) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders of the
Corporation entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution
or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights
in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose
of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix a record date,
which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing
the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than
sixty days prior to such action. If no record date is fixed, the record date
for determining stockholders of the Corporation for any such purpose shall be
at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the
resolution relating thereto.

  



  

Section 1.9. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The Secretary shall
prepare and make, at least ten days before every meeting of stockholders of
the Corporation, a complete list of the stockholders of the Corporation
entitled to vote at the meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , if the record date
for determining the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote is less
than ten days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the
stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote as of the tenth day before
the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of
each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Nothing in this Section 1.9 shall require the Corporation to
include electronic mail addresses or other electronic content information on
such list. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder of
the Corporation for any purpose germane to the meeting for a period of at
least ten days prior to the meeting: (a) on a reasonably accessible electronic
network; _provided_ that the information required to gain access to such list
is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during ordinary
business hours at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the
event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an
electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that
such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the
meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders of the
Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the
time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof and may be
examined by any stockholder of the Corporation who is present. If the meeting
is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then such list shall
also be open to the examination of any stockholder of the Corporation during
the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network,
and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the
notice of the meeting.

Section 1.10. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_.

  



  

(a) Unless otherwise provided in the Charter, any action required by
applicable law to be taken at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any
annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a
meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent or consents in
writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of
outstanding stock of the Corporation having not less than the minimum number
of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a
meeting at which all shares of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to
(i) its registered office in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified
mail or registered mail, return receipt requested, (ii) its principal place of
business or (iii) an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of
the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders of the Corporation
are recorded.

  



  

(b) Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each
stockholder of the Corporation who signs the consent, and no written
consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein
unless, within sixty days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the

signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the
Corporation by delivery to (i) its registered office in the State of Delaware
by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, (ii)
its principal place of business or (iii) an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded.

(c) A telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an
action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder of the Corporation or
proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or
proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written and signed for the purposes of
this Section 1.10; provided, that any such telegram, cablegram or other
electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from
which the Corporation can determine (i) that the telegram, cablegram or
other electronic transmission was transmitted by the stockholder of the
Corporation or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for
the stockholder or proxyholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or
proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to
be the date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram,
cablegram or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been
delivered until such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper
form shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to (A) its registered
office in the State of Delaware by hand or by certified or registered mail,
return receipt requested, (B) its principal place of business or (C) an
officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Notwithstanding the
foregoing limitations on delivery, consents given by telegram, cablegram or
other electronic transmission, may be otherwise delivered to the principal
place of business of the Corporation or to an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner provided by
resolution of the Board of Directors, these Bylaws or the Charter. Any copy,
facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be
substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes
for which the original writing could be used; provided, that such copy,
facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire
original writing.

  



  

(d) Prompt notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by
less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who
have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a
meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date
for such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a
sufficient number of stockholders to take the action were delivered to the
Corporation as provided in this Section 1.10.

  



  

(e) Any person executing a consent may provide, whether through instruction
to an agent or otherwise, that such a consent will be effective at a future
time (including a time determined upon the happening of an event), no later
than sixty days after such instruction is given or such provision is made, if
evidence of such instruction or provision is provided to the Corporation.
Unless otherwise provided, any such consent shall be revocable prior to its
becoming effective.

Section 3.1. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. The Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as
alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent
or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or
disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members thereof
present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such
member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member
of the Board of Directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such

may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the
management of the business and affairs of the Corporation, and may authorize
the seal of the Corporation (if any) to be affixed to all papers that may
require it, but no such committee shall have the power or authority in

may also elect one or more vice presidents, one or more assistant vice
presidents, one or more assistant secretaries or such other officers of the
Corporation as the Board of Directors may deem desirable or appropriate and
may give any of them such further designations or alternate titles as it
considers desirable. Any number of offices of the Corporation may be held by
the same person unless the Charter or these Bylaws provide otherwise. The
election of an officer of the Corporation shall not of itself create
contractual rights.

otherwise provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors electing any
officer of the Corporation, each officer of the Corporation shall hold office

effective date or an effectiveness determined upon the happening of an event
or events, in which case it shall be effective at such later date or upon the
happening of such event or events, and unless otherwise specified therein, no
acceptance of such resignation shall be necessary to make it effective. The
Board of Directors may remove any officer of the Corporation with or without
cause at any time. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation by
death, resignation, removal or otherwise may be filled by the Board of
Directors at any regular or special meeting.

Section 4.3. _Powers and Duties_. The officers of the Corporation shall have

required by applicable law, all contracts or other agreements,
understandings, arrangements or instruments of the Corporation shall be
executed on behalf of the Corporation by the President or any vice
president of the Corporation, such other employee of the Corporation
authorized in writing by the President or any vice president of
the Corporation, with such limitations or restrictions as may be authorized
by the Board of Directors. In case any officer is absent, or for any other
reason that the Board of Directors may deem necessary or desirable, the
President or the Board of Directors may delegate for the time being the
powers or duties of such officer to any other officer or to any director. The
Board of Directors may require any employee of the Corporation (including,

duties.

Stock

  



  

Section 5.1. _Stock Certificates_. The shares of stock in the Corporation
shall be represented by certificates; _provided_ that the Board of Directors
may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all
classes or series of the Corporation's stock shall be uncertificated shares.
Any such resolution shall not apply to shares of the Corporation represented
by a certificate theretofore issued until such certificate is surrendered to
the Corporation. Notwithstanding the adoption of such a resolution or
resolutions by the Board of Directors, every holder of stock of the
Corporation represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a
certificate signed by or in the name of the Corporation by any two authorized
officers of the Corporation, representing the number of shares of stock in
the Corporation owned by such holder. If such certificate is manually signed
by one officer or manually countersigned by a transfer agent or by a
registrar, any other signature on the certificate may be a facsimile or other
reliable reproduction. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who
has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate
shall have ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such
certificate is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same
effect as if such person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the
date of issue. Except as otherwise expressly provided by applicable law, the
rights and obligations of the holders of uncertificated shares of the
Corporation and the rights and obligations of the holders of certificates
representing stock of the same class and series of stock of the Corporation
shall be identical.

Section 5.2. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Stock Certificates; Issuance of New
Certificates_. The Corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or
uncertificated shares of the Corporation in the place of any certificate
theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
and the Corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, or such owner's legal representative, to give the Corporation a
bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it
on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate
or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares.

Section 6.3. _Waiver of Notice of Meetings of Stockholders, Directors and

any provision of the Charter or these Bylaws, a written waiver thereof,
signed by the person entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic
transmission by the person entitled to notice, whether before or after the
time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a
person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting,
except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business
to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
stockholders of the Corporation, directors or members of a committee of
directors of the Corporation need be specified in any written waiver of
notice unless so required by the Charter or these Bylaws.

Section 6.4. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) Each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is involved in any action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a " _proceeding_ "), by
reason of the fact that he or she or a person of whom he or she is the legal
representative is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while
serving as a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to employee benefit plans, shall
be indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent
authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the
same exists or may hereafter be amended, against all expense, liability and
loss (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines,
penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred
or suffered by such person in connection therewith and such indemnification
shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and
shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that except as provided in paragraph (b) of this
Section 6.4 with respect to proceedings seeking to enforce rights to
indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated
by such person only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized in the
first instance by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

  



  

(b) If a claim under paragraph (a) of this Section 6.4 is not paid in full by
the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by
the Corporation, or if a claim for any advancement of expenses under this
Section 6.4 is not paid in full within thirty days after the Corporation has
received a statement or statements requesting such amounts to be advanced, the
claimant may at any time thereafter (but not before) bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in
whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense
of prosecuting such claim to the fullest extent permitted by law. It shall be
a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim
for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final
disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has been
tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of
conduct which make it permissible under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed, but the burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation.
Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
any committee of the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances
because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination
by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, any committee of the
Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the
claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense
to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.

  



  

(c) The right to indemnification and the payment of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding in advance of its final disposition conferred in this
Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which any person may have or
hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of the Certificate of
Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
directors or otherwise.

  



  

(d) The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself
and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the
power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

  



  

   

F-15

 



    



  

(e) The Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the
Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid by
the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance
of its final disposition, to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the
fullest extent of the provisions of this Bylaw with respect to the
indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the
Corporation.

  



  

(f) The right to indemnification conferred in this Bylaw on the persons
entitled thereto shall be a contract right and shall include the right to be
paid by the Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding
in advance of its final disposition;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware requires the payment of such
expenses incurred by a director or officer in his or her capacity as a
director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such person while a director or officer, including, without
limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding, such advancement shall be made only upon delivery
to the Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or
officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined that such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified
under this Bylaw or otherwise.

  



  

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, claimant's right to indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided under this Article VI shall (i) vest at the

between the Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or
between the Corporation and any other corporation, partnership, association
or other organization in which one or more of its directors or officers are
directors or officers or equivalents, or have a financial interest, shall be
void or voidable solely for this reason, or solely because the director or
officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the Board of Directors
or committee thereof that authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely
because his or her or their votes are counted for such purpose, if: (a) the
material facts as to his or her relationship or interest and as to the
contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of
Directors or the committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good
faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a
majority of the disinterested directors, even though the disinterested
directors be less than a quorum; (b) the material facts as to his or her
relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed
or are known to the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon,
and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote
of the stockholders of the Corporation; or (c) the contract or transaction is
fair as to the Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or
ratified by the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders of
the Corporation. Common or interested directors may be counted in determining
the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or of a
