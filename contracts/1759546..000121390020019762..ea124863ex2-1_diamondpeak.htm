the consent of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to serve as the exchange agent (the &ldquo;<B><U>Exchange

Class&nbsp;A Common Stock to be issued in non-certificated book-entry form and an aggregate amount of cash, in each case, comprising
the amounts required to be delivered in respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.1</U> and <U>2.7</U>.
The relative amounts of Stock Merger Consideration and Cash Merger Consideration initially deposited will be determined based
on information contained in investor questionnaires delivered pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.9 at least five (5) Business Days prior
to the Effective Time or as otherwise determined by Parent in accordance with the last sentence of Section&nbsp;2.1(a). If, subsequent
to such deposit, the relative amounts of Stock Merger Consideration and Cash Merger Consideration are adjusted due to receipt
of additional investor questionnaires or otherwise, the amounts on deposit with the Exchange Agent shall be adjusted accordingly.
In addition, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time after the Effective
Time, any dividends or other distributions, if any, to which the holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant
to <U>Section&nbsp;2.10</U> with both a record and payment date after the Effective Time and prior to the surrender of such shares

The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than a purpose expressly provided for in this Agreement. The cash portion
of the Exchange Fund may be deposited by the Exchange Agent as reasonably directed by Parent. To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such deposits, a default of an applicable bank or for any other reason any amount in the Exchange Fund is below
that required to make prompt payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and the other payments contemplated by this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U>,
Parent shall promptly replace, restore or supplement the shares of Parent Class&nbsp;A Common Stock or cash, as applicable, in
the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent
to make the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration and the other payments contemplated by this <U>Article&nbsp;II</U>.
Any interest and other income resulting from such deposit may become part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the
amounts payable under <U>Section&nbsp;2.1</U> may, at the discretion of Parent, be promptly returned to Parent or the Surviving
Corporation.</P>

As of the Execution Date, Parent has approximately $284,300,000 in the account established by Parent for the benefit of its stockholders
at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the &ldquo;<B><U>Parent Trust Account</U></B>&rdquo;), such monies being invested in
U.S. Government treasury bills or money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule&nbsp;2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended, and held in trust pursuant to that certain Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of
February&nbsp;27, 2019, between Parent and American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company, LLC, as trustee (the &ldquo;<B><U>Parent
Trust Agreement</U></B>&rdquo;). The Parent Trust Agreement is valid and in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and has not been amended or modified. Parent has complied in all
material respects with the terms of the Parent Trust Agreement and is not in breach thereof or default thereunder and there does
not exist under the Parent Trust Agreement any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would constitute such
a breach or default by Parent or the trustee under the Parent Trust Agreement (the &ldquo;<B><U>Trustee</U></B>&rdquo;). There
are no separate Contracts, side letters or other arrangements or understandings (whether written or unwritten, express or implied)
that would cause the description of the Parent Trust Agreement in the Parent Reports to be inaccurate in any material respect
or that would, to the Knowledge of Parent, entitle any Person (other than pursuant to a Parent Share Redemption) to any portion
of the proceeds in the Parent Trust Account. There are no proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened with
respect to the Parent Trust Account. Upon the consummation of the Merger and notice thereof to the Trustee pursuant to the Parent
Trust Agreement, Parent shall cause the Trustee to, and the Trustee shall thereupon be obligated to, release to Parent as promptly
as practicable, the funds in the Parent Trust Account in accordance with the Parent Trust Agreement at which point the Parent
Trust Account shall terminate; provided, however, that the liabilities and obligations of Parent due and owing or incurred at
or prior to the Effective Time shall be paid as and when due, including all amounts payable (a) to stockholders of Parent who
shall have exercised applicable redemption rights, (b) with respect to filings, applications and/or other actions taken pursuant
to this Agreement required under Law, (c) to the Trustee for fees and costs incurred in accordance with the Parent Trust Agreement;
and (d) to third parties (e.g., professionals, printers, etc.) who have rendered services to Parent in connection with its efforts
to effect the Merger. As of the Execution Date, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company herein
and the compliance by the Company with its respective obligations hereunder, Parent has no reason to believe that any of the conditions
to the use of funds in the Parent Trust Account will not be satisfied or funds available in the Parent Trust Account will not
be available to Parent at the Effective Time.</P>

Investments</U>. Parent has made available to the Company true, correct and complete copies of the Subscription Agreements.
As of the date of this Agreement, the Subscription Agreements (a) are in full force and effect without amendment or
modification, (b) are the valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Parent (or its applicable Affiliate) and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each other party thereto (except, in any case, as may be limited by Bankruptcy and Equity Exception) and
(c) have not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. The PIPE Investment, together with the amount in the
Parent Trust Account at the Closing, will be in the aggregate sufficient to enable Parent to (a) pay all cash amounts
required to be paid by Parent under or in connection with this Agreement and (b) pay any and all Transaction Expenses. There
are no other Contracts between Parent and any PIPE Investor relating to any Subscription Agreement, that would reasonably be
expected to affect the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable portion of the PIPE
Investment set forth in the Subscription Agreements, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no facts or circumstances exist that
may reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in any Subscription Agreement not being satisfied, or
the PIPE Investment not being available to Parent, on the Closing Date. No event has occurred that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any material term or condition of any
Subscription Agreement and, as of the Execution Date, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy in
all material respects on a timely basis any term or condition of Closing to be satisfied by it contained in any Subscription
Agreement. The Subscription Agreements contain all of the conditions precedent (other than the conditions contained in this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents) to the obligations of the PIPE Investors to contribute to Parent the applicable
portion of the PIPE Investment set forth in the Subscription Agreements on the terms therein.</P>

written notice from Parent that such Stockholder may resume such offers and sales, and (ii) such Stockholder will maintain the
confidentiality of any information included in such written notice delivered by Parent unless otherwise required by Applicable
Law or subpoena. If so directed by Parent, each Stockholder will deliver to Parent or, in such Stockholder&rsquo;s sole discretion
destroy, all copies of the Prospectus covering the Common Stock in such Stockholder&rsquo;s possession; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>,
that this obligation to deliver or destroy all copies of the Prospectus covering the Common Stock shall not apply (i)&nbsp;to the

extent permitted by law. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses
incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is required, has
been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of
proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, any
committee of the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement
of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard
of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including
its Board of Directors, any committee of the Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or stockholders) that the claimant has
not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not
met the applicable standard of conduct.</P>
