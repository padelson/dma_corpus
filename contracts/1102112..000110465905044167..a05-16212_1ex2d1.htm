 THE MERGER**

  



  

2.01. _The Combination_. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall
merge with and into the Company to consummate the Merger and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease.  The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger, and shall continue to exist as a
California state-chartered bank (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "
_Surviving Bank_ ") with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
franchises continuing unaffected by the Merger. Immediately after the
Merger, the Surviving Bank will be merged with and into Pacific Western
National Bank, a national banking association, all of the outstanding capital
stock of which is directly owned by Parent, or another wholly-owned direct
Subsidiary of Parent. Parent may, at any time prior to the Effective Time
(including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, after the Company
Shareholder Approval) change the method of effecting the combination of
Merger Subsidiary with the Company (including, without limitation, the
provisions of this Article II ) if and to the extent it deems such change to
be necessary, appropriate or desirable; _provided, however_ , that no such
change shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be
paid to holders of Company Common Stock as provided for in this Agreement,
(ii) prevent, materially impede or materially delay consummation of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii)
otherwise be prejudicial to the interests of the shareholders of the Company.

  



  

### (b) _Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Bank immediately after the
Effective Time shall be the articles of incorporation and by-laws of
the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Directors and Officers of Parent_. The directors and officers of
the Surviving Bank immediately after the Effective Time shall be the
directors and officers of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until such time as their successors shall be duly elected and
qualified.

  



  

7   

     
   

  



  

### (d) _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in CCC §1107, including any regulations or rules
promulgated thereunder.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Merger Subsidiary shall vest in the
Surviving Bank and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of the Merger Subsidiary shall become the debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Bank.

  

### 

  

2.02. _Effective Date and Effective Time_. Subject to the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the consummation of
the Merger, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), on
the date which is no earlier than January 3, 2006, but in any event at least
two (2) Business Days following the date on which all of the approvals of
Governmental Authorities have been obtained, the Agreement of Merger shall be
filed with the California Secretary of State, in accordance with all
appropriate legal requirements together with such certificates or other
documents executed as may be required by law, and the Merger provided for
herein shall become effective upon such filing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such timing would cause the filing date to be later than the 24th of
the month (or the 20th of a month which is the end of a quarter), then the
filing date shall be extended by the minimum amount of time to ensure that
the filing date occurs on the 1st Business Day of the subsequent month.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, the filing
date may be set on any other date on which the parties may mutually agree.
The date of such filing is herein called the " _Effective Date_." The "
_Effective Time_ " of the Merger shall be the time of such filing.

  



  

# **ARTICLE III 
  
 CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES**

  



  

3.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_.  Subject to the other provisions of this
Article III, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
additional action on the part of the holders of shares of Parent Common
Stock, the holders of Company Common Stock or the sole shareholder of the
Merger Subsidiary:

  



  

### (a) _Parent Common Stock_. Each share of Parent Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued
and outstanding share of common stock of Parent, and shall not be affected by
the Merger;

  

### 

  

### (b) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock, issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Dissenters Shares and Treasury Shares, as defined below), shall be converted
into the right to receive, in cash and without interest, the
Merger Consideration (as defined below). At the Effective Time, all shares
of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration.

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

### " _Merger Consideration_ " shall be calculated immediately prior to
the Effective Time by Parent shall mean an amount equal to (i) the sum of
(x) $120,000,000 plus (y) the aggregate exercise price of all In-the-Money
Company Stock Options (as defined below) outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time divided by (ii) the sum of (x) the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
plus (y) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such
In-the-Money Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, the aggregate consideration for
all of the Company Common Stock and Company Stock Options, in each case
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be $120,000,000. "
_In-the-Money Company Stock Options_ " shall mean those Company Stock Options
having an exercise price of less than $130.76 per share;

  

### 

  

### (c) _Dissenters  Shares_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are
"dissenting shares" within the meaning of CCC §1300 (" _Dissenters  Shares_")
shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger
Consideration hereunder unless and until such shares have lost their status
as dissenting shares under CCC §1300, at which time such shares shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.04;

  

### 

  

### (d) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Any shares of Company Common Stock
held directly or indirectly by Parent or the Company, other than those held
on behalf of a Company shareholder (other than Parent or the Company) in
trust accounts, managed accounts or otherwise in a fiduciary capacity or as a
result of debts previously contracted (collectively, " _Treasury Shares_ "),
shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time and no consideration
shall be issued in exchange therefor; and

  

### 

  

### (e) _Merger Subsidiary Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock of the
Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one issued and outstanding share of Common Stock
of the Surviving Bank.

  

### 

  

3.02. _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the Effective Time,
holders of Company Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights
as, shareholders of the Company other than to receive the Merger
Consideration. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock.

  



  

3.03. _Exchange Procedures_. (a) _Exchange Agent_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares an amount that
constitutes the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.01(b) upon
surrender of Certificates (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), it being
understood that any and all interest or income earned on funds made available
to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall belong to Parent. At
the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, any such cash remaining in
the possession of the Exchange Agent (together with any dividends or earnings
in respect thereof) shall be returned to Parent. Any former holders of
Company Common Stock who have not theretofore exchanged their Certificates
for the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article III shall thereafter be
entitled to look exclusively to Parent, and only as general creditors
thereof, to which they are entitled to upon exchange of their Certificates
pursuant to this Article III, without any interest thereon.

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

### (b) _Exchange of Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Date, but in no event later than five (5) Business Days thereafter,
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each former holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
transmittal materials for use in exchanging such shareholders Certificates
for the Merger Consideration set forth in this Article III. If practicable,
Parent shall make available such transmittal materials to the Company prior
to the Effective Time. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or
indemnity reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent, if any of
such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed) for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with the transmittal materials duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the record
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax deductions
and withholdings in accordance with Section 3.03(d)), which, if practicable,
shall be paid within five (5) Business Days of the later of receipt of such
materials or the Effective Time, and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the proper amount of the Merger
Consideration may be paid in exchange therefor to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so delivered is registered if the
Certificate formerly representing such shares is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable Taxes have been paid.

  

### 

  

### (c) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange
Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Withholding Rights_. Parent or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts
as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign tax law.  To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

  

### 

  

3.04. _Dissenters  Rights_. (a) Any Dissenting Shareholder who shall
be entitled to be paid the value of such shareholders shares of Company
Common Stock, as provided in Sections 1300 through 1312 of the CCC, shall not
be entitled to the Merger Consideration in respect thereof provided for
under Section 3.01(b) unless and until such Dissenting Shareholder shall

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
such Dissenting Shareholders right to dissent from the Merger under the CCC,
and shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided for by Sections
1300 through 1312 of the CCC with respect to such Dissenters Shares.

  



  

### (b) If any Dissenting Shareholder shall fail to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such right to dissent, each share of Company
Common Stock of such Dissenting Shareholder shall be deemed not to be a
Dissenters Share and shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to applicable law received by the Company
relating to shareholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to (x)
approve the form and content of the notice to holders pursuant to § 1301 of
the CCC and (y) direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands
for appraisal of Dissenters Shares, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.

  

### 

  

3.05. _Company Stock Options_.  Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding Company Stock Option, whether vested or unvested immediately
prior to the Effective Time, will be cancelled and terminated by the Company
in exchange for an amount of cash, without interest, equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
multiplied by the Option Spread less applicable Taxes required to be withheld
with respect to such payment (the " _Option Consideration_ ").  The " _Option
Spread_ " for a Company Stock Option will be equal to the arithmetic
difference between (y) the Merger Consideration and (z) the per share
exercise price of the Company Stock Option. Any Company Stock Option for which
the per share exercise price exceeds the Merger Consideration shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time without the payment of any consideration
therefor.

the Confidentiality Agreement) confidential in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

  

### 

  

6.05. _Acquisition Proposals_.  The Company agrees that it shall not, and
that it shall direct and use its best efforts to cause its directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives (including any financial
advisor, attorney or accountant retained by it) not to, directly or
indirectly, initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any
inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer with respect to a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or similar transaction
involving, or any purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company or more than 10% of the outstanding equity securities of, the Company
(any such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ ").  The Company further agrees that it shall not, and that it
shall direct and use its best efforts to cause its directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives (including any financial advisor,
attorney or accountant retained by it) not to, directly or indirectly, engage
in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or
data to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement
an Acquisition Proposal; _provided, however_ , that nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prevent the Company or the Company Board from (A) complying
with its disclosure obligations under federal or state law; (B) at any time
prior to the earlier of (x) forty-five (45) days after the date hereof, (y)
the Company Meeting or (z) the date the Company Shareholder Approval is
obtained (the " _Section 6.05 Date_ "), providing information in response to
a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board receives from the Person
so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement no
less restrictive to such third party than the Confidentiality Agreement is
with respect to Parent; (C) at any time prior to the Section 6.05 Date,
engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; or (D) at any time prior
to the Section 6.05 Date, recommending any definitive agreement resulting
from such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the
shareholders of the Company, if and only to the extent that, (i) in each such
case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D) above, the Company has not
breached its obligations under Section 6.05 and the Company Board reasonably
determines (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure
to take such action would breach, or would reasonably be expected to breach,
the Company Boards fiduciary duties under applicable law, (ii) in each such
case referred to in clause (B), (C) or (D), such Acquisition Proposal
includes sufficient information for the Company Board to reasonably conclude
that (x) it is a Superior Proposal (as defined below), (y) the Person making
the Acquisition Proposal has the financial and other resources and has the

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

legal and regulatory ability to complete the proposed transaction, and (z)
the Acquisition Proposal will not be subject to any material contingency
other than those contained in this Agreement, (iii) in each such case
referred to in clause (C) or (D) above, the Company Board reasonably
determines (after consultation with its advisors) that such Acquisition
Proposal, if accepted, is reasonably likely to be consummated, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal and would, if consummated, result in a transaction
in which the Companys shareholders would receive greater consideration per
share than the Merger (any such more favorable Acquisition Proposal being
referred to in this Agreement as a " _Superior Proposal_ "), and (iv) in such
case as referred to in clause (D) above, the Company provides Parent the
opportunity to propose modifications to this Agreement in response to such
Superior Proposal, negotiates in good faith with respect thereto with Parent
for five (5) Business Days and the Company Board determines (after
consultation with its advisor and taking into account any proposed
modifications to this Agreement) that the Acquisition Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition
Proposals.  The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to
promptly inform the individuals referred to in the first sentence hereof of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 6.05 and that it will use its
reasonable best efforts to prevent any action by the directors or officers of
the Company that are inconsistent with, or in violation of, the provisions of
this Section 6.05. The Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly,
but in no event later than the second (2nd) succeeding Business Day, if any
such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, any of its representatives, indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposal or offer and thereafter shall keep Parent
informed, on a regular basis, of changes in the status and terms of any such
proposals or offers and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.
The Company shall provide Parent with at least 48 hour notice, or such lesser
notice as provided to the Company Board, prior to any meeting of the Company
Board in which the taking of any action referred to in this Section 6.05 may
be considered or in which any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal may
be considered.

  



  

6.06. _Certain Policies_.  Prior to the Effective Date, the Company shall,
consistent with GAAP and applicable banking laws and regulations, modify or
change its loan, OREO, accrual, reserve, tax, litigation, real estate
valuation, Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering policies and practices
(including loan classifications and levels of reserves) so as to be applied
on a basis that is consistent with that of Parent, including cooperating with
Parent and its officers and consultants with respect to such modification or
changes; _provided, however_ , that no such action shall in itself be a
breach under Section 8.01(b) of this Agreement unless the policies and
procedures would otherwise breach a representation or warranty prior to the
modification. The modification or change of any such policy or practice shall
not be deemed to imply an violation of any applicable law and shall not be
construed as a concurrence of the Company or its management with any such
change or modification.

  



  

34   

     
   

  



  

6.07. _Regulatory Applications_.  (a) Each of Parent and the Company shall
cooperate and use their respective reasonable best efforts to prepare all
documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and any initial filings with Governmental Authorities shall be
made by Parent as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution hereof
but, provided that the Company has cooperated as described above, in no event
later than thirty (30) days after the date hereof. Each of Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each shall consult with the other, in each case subject
to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to
all material written information submitted to any third party or any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of such parties
agrees to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto
agrees that it shall consult with the other parties hereto with respect to
the obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations
of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party
shall keep the other parties apprised of the status of material matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

### (b) Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other parties with
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of such other parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
third party or Governmental Authority.

  

### 

  

6.08. _Indemnification_.  (a) Following the Effective Time until the third
(3rd) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each present and former director and officer of the Company
(each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against all costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ "), incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any related agreement,
but excluding any Costs arising out of any violation or alleged violation of
the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to
insider trading) to the fullest extent that the Company is permitted to
indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors or officers under the CCC,
the Company Articles and the Company By-Laws as in effect on the date hereof
(and Parent shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law, _provided_ , the Person to whom expenses are
advanced agrees to the indemnification terms hereunder and provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification); _provided_ that any
determination required to be made with respect to whether an officers or
directors conduct complies with the standards set forth under the CCC, the
Company Articles and the Company By-Laws shall be made by independent counsel
selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party.

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

### (b) For a period of three (3) years from the Effective Time, Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide that portion of directors
and officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and
former officers and directors (determined as of the Effective Time) of the
Company (as opposed to the portion that serves to reimburse the Company) with
respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts or
events which occurred before the Effective Time, which insurance shall
contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and
conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by the
Company; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to
expend on an annual basis more than 100% of the current amount expended on an
annual basis by the Company (the " _Insurance Amount_ ") to maintain or
procure such directors and officers insurance coverage; _provided, further_ ,
that if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by
this Section 6.08(b), Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount;
_provided, further_ , that officers and directors of the Company may be
required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to Parents insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such
insurance.

  

### 

  

### (c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.08(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify Parent thereof;
_provided_  that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of
Parent under Section 6.08(a) unless and to the extent that Parent is actually
prejudiced, in any material respect, as a result of such failure. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Bank
shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and Parent shall not be
liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or
any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in
connection with the defense thereof, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) Parent shall not be
liable for any settlement effected without its prior written consent. Parent
shall not have any obligation under Section 6.08(a) to any Indemnified Party
if and when a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitral tribunal shall
ultimately determine that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to
indemnification or the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law, in which case the
Indemnified Party shall promptly repay any amounts previously reimbursed,
paid or advanced by Parent.

  

### 

  

### (d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with
or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving
entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially
all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.08.

  

### 

  

### (e) The provisions of this Section 6.08 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by each of, the officers and directors
of the Company and their respective heirs and personal representatives.

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

6.09. _Benefit Plans_.  (a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
former employees of the Company who remain as employees of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries with employee benefit plans substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries, as the case may be. Parent shall cause each employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of Parent in which employees of
the Company are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes
of eligibility and vesting (but not for purposes of benefit accrual)
thereunder the service of such employees with the Company to the same extent
as such service was credited by the Companys applicable employee benefit
plan program policy or arrangement. Nothing herein shall limit the ability
of Parent to amend or terminate any of the Benefit Plans in accordance with
their terms at any time.

  



  

### (b) If employees of the Company become eligible to participate in a
medical, dental or health plan of Parent, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause, to the extent practicable, each such plan to (i)
waive any preexisting condition limitations to the extent such conditions
were covered under the applicable medical, health or dental plans of the
Company, (ii) honor under such plans any deductible, co-payment and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the
portion of the calendar year prior to such participation and (iii) waive any
waiting period limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would
otherwise be applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time to
the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous plan of the Company prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (c) Parent shall honor, and shall continue to be obligated to perform, in
accordance with their terms, all employment or severance agreements between
the Company and a Company employee that are identified in Schedule 6.09 of
the Disclosure Schedule hereto.

give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to
it that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained herein.

  



  

6.12. _FIRPTA Certificate_.  The Company shall have delivered to Parent a
form of notice to the Internal Revenue Service in accordance with the
requirements of Treasury regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2) and in form and

transactions contemplated by this

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

Agreement or their effect on such employees, with Parent given the
opportunity to participate in such meetings or interviews, it being
understood that this section is not intended to apply to casual conversations
about the transaction or informal meetings initiated by employees, or to
prohibit discussion in general, but rather to allow Parent a role in the
formal presentation of the transaction to employees, and an opportunity to
participate in the significant, formal meetings at which the transaction is
explained and discussed.  The Company agrees to work in good faith with
Parent to facilitate the timely and accurate dissemination of information to
employees regarding matters related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in such a manner as to cause minimal disruption of the business of
the Company and its relationships with its employees and to facilitate the
transaction of such relationships to Parent or its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be.

  



  

6.14. _Assistance with Third-Party Agreements_. (a)  The Company shall
cooperate with and use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent
in (i) gaining access to and obtaining any required consents from all of its
third-party vendors, landlords of all of the Companys leased properties and
other parties to material agreements, promptly after the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) obtaining the cooperation of such third parties in a
smooth transition in accordance with Parents timetable at or after the
Effective Time. The Company shall cooperate with Parent in minimizing the
extent to which any contracts will continue in effect following the Effective
Time, in addition to complying with the prohibition of Section 4.01(l)
hereof.

  



  

### (b) Without limiting Section 6.14(a), the Company shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to provide data processing and other
processing support or outside contractors to assist Parent in performing all
tasks reasonably required to result in a successful conversion of their data
and other files and records to Parents production environment, when
requested by Parent and sufficient to ensure that a successful conversion can
occur at such time as Parent requests on or after the Effective Time.
Among other things, the Company shall:

  

### 

  

#### (i) cooperate with Parent to establish a mutually agreeable project plan
to effectuate the conversion;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to have the Companys
outside contractors continue to support both the conversion effort and its
needs until the conversion can be established;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) provide, or use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from
any outside contractors, all data or other files and layouts requested by
Parent for use in planning the conversion, as soon as reasonably practicable;

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) provide reasonable access to personnel at corporate headquarters,
data and other processing centers, all branches and, with the consent of
outside contractors, at outside contractors, to enable the conversion effort
to be completed on schedule; and

  

#### 

  

#### (v) to the extent reasonably practicable, give notice of termination,
conditioned upon the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby, of
the contracts of outside data and other processing contractors or other
third-party vendors when directed to do so by Parent.

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

### (c) Parent agrees that all actions taken pursuant to this Section 6.14
shall be taken in a manner intended to minimize disruption to the customary
business activities of the Company.

  

### 

  

6.15. _Shareholder Agreements_.  The Company shall use its best efforts to
cause the Shareholders marked with an asterisk on Schedule D to execute and
deliver to Parent, promptly after the date hereof, a Shareholder Agreement
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto.

  



  

6.16. _Additional Agreements_.  In case at any time after the Effective Time
any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement or to vest Parent with full title to all properties, assets,
rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of the Company, the proper
officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall take all
necessary or appropriate action.

  



  

6.17. _Pre-Closing Adjustments_. At or before the Effective Time, the
Company shall make such accounting entries or adjustments, including
additions to their ALL and charge-offs of loans, as Parent shall direct as a
result of its on-going review of the Company (including its review of the
information provided to it pursuant to Sections 6.04 and 6.11) or in order to
implement its plans following the closing of the transactions constituting
the Merger, (the " _Closing_ ") or to reflect expenses and costs related to
the Merger; _provided, however_ , that unless the adjustment would otherwise
be required by applicable law, rule or regulation, or by regulatory
accounting principles and GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the
financial statements of the Company, (a) the Company shall not be required to
take such actions more than one (1) day prior to the Effective Time or prior
to the time Parent agrees in writing that all of the conditions to
its obligation to close as set forth in Section 7.03 have been satisfied or
waived and each of the approvals in Section 7.01(b) have been received, and
(b) no such adjustment shall (i) require any filing with any Governmental
Authority, (ii) violate any law, rule or regulation applicable to the
Company, Parent or the Merger Subsidiary, (iii) otherwise materially
disadvantage the Company if the Merger was not consummated or (iv) constitute
or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or failure to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of this
Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether any such breach,
violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred. The recording of any
such adjustments shall not be deemed to imply any misstatement of
previously furnished Company Financial Statements or information and shall
not be construed as a concurrence of the Company or its management with any
such adjustments.

  



  

6.18. _Company Stock Options_.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its best efforts to take such actions as may be necessary such that
immediately prior to the Effective Time each unexercised Company Stock Option
which would otherwise remain outstanding immediately after the Effective
Time, whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled and only entitle
the holder thereof, as soon as reasonably practicable after surrender
thereof, to receive an amount in cash, without interest, from the Company
equal to the Option Consideration as set forth in Section 3.05. In addition,
if so requested by Parent, at least twenty (20) Business

  



  

39

shall use its best efforts to obtain a written acknowledgement and waiver (in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent) from each holder of a
Company Stock Option or share of restricted stock (i) confirming the number
of Company Stock Options and shares of restricted stock held, (ii) confirming
that the treatment of such Company Stock Options and restricted stock
pursuant to this Agreement and the Option Consideration or Merger
Consideration to be paid is correct, (iii) authorizing the withholding of all
applicable taxes, and (iv) containing such other matters as reasonably
determined by Parent (an " _Acknowledgment and Waiver_ ") and shall provide
a copy of each such Acknowledgement and Waiver to Parent at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Effective Time.  The Company shall use its best
efforts to take all necessary action to ensure that, immediately prior to the

whether or not then exercisable shall terminate and be of no further effect
and any rights thereunder to purchase shares of Company Common Stock shall
also terminate and be of no further force or effect.

immediately preceding the Effective Date, the Company shall terminate the
Cedars Bank Savings and Retirement Plan (the " _401(k) Plan_ ") unless Parent
provides written notice to the Company that the 401(k) Plan shall not be
terminated. Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company, the
Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the 401(k) Plan has been
terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the
Effective Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board. The form
and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to the review and
reasonable and timely approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such
other actions in furtherance of terminating the 401(k) Plan as Parent may
reasonably require.

  



  

6.20. _BOLI Termination_.  Effective as of no later than the day immediately
preceding the Effective Date, the Company shall terminate the Bank-Owned Life
Insurance Policies from Pacific Life Insurance Company and Sun Life Assurance
Company of Canada and the Cedars Survivor Benefit Plan (collectively, the "

Company, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that the BOLI has
been terminated (effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding
the Effective Date). Any actions taken with respect to the termination of the
BOLI shall be subject to the review and reasonable and timely approval of
Parent.

  



  

6.21. _Investments_. In consultation with Parent, the Company shall take such
actions as may be necessary to liquidate immediately prior to the Effective
Date, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set forth in
Article VII of this Agreement (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the consummation of the Merger, including
Section 7.03(c)), that portion of its investment securities, real estate, tax
credit investments and OREO identified by Parent on terms reasonably
satisfactory to Parent.

  



  

40

audit its financial statements as of and for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 2005 and issue their unqualified opinion prior to December 16,
2005.  Such audit shall not identify any significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in internal controls. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 8.01, Parent shall reimburse the Company for a portion of
such audit equal to the following amount: fifty percent (50%) of the
difference between (x) total cost billed by KPMG LLP for the September 30,
2005 audit and the December 31, 2005 audit minus (y) the cost of the December
