Tax reporting position (including withholding) inconsistent with such
treatment, except as otherwise required by Legal Requirements or a
Governmental Entity. 

---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | Notwithstanding Section 1.2(c), a portion of the Per Share
Cash Consideration payable by Sub to Marcel LeBrun pursuant to Section 1.2(c),

     | (v) | An aggregate amount equal to the Expense Amount, will be
withheld from the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration and Preferred Share
Preference Per Share otherwise payable to the Shareholders and from the

Shareholder and Participating Optionholder as set out in the Spreadsheet, and
deposited by the Sub with LaBarge Weinstein Professional Corporation in trust
pursuant to Section 8.7(d) hereof. 
---|---|--- 

(e) _Treatment of Company Options_



     | (i) |

_Unvested Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each Company Option (or
portion thereof) that is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be assumed by Parent (to the extent unvested) as a
Parent Option. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each unvested
Company Option so assumed by Parent pursuant to this Section 1.2(e)(i) shall
continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including
vesting terms) as those set forth in the Plan and the option agreements
relating thereto in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except
that (A) such assumed unvested Company Option will be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the
number of Company Non-Voting Common Shares that were issuable upon exercise of
such unvested Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, and (B) the per share exercise price
for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
unvested Company Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
the exercise price per Company Non-Voting Common Share at which such assumed
unvested Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. For
greater certainty, no other consideration shall be payable to 

---|---|--- 
 



-12-   the holders of unvested Company Options by the Parent in connection with the
assumption by the Parent of the unvested Company Options. 

---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | _Vested Company Options_. At the Effective Time, each
Company Option (or portion thereof) that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time that is then vested shall, to the extent not
exercised prior to the Effective Time, be purchased by the Company for an
amount in cash equal to, for each Common Non-Voting Share underlying such
vested Company Option (or portion thereof), the amount by which the Purchase
Price Per Share exceeds the exercise price for such Common Non-Voting Share,
and each such vested Company Option (or portion thereof) shall thereafter be
terminated without any further action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company
or the holder thereof. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all action necessary to effect the terminations anticipated by this Section
1.2(e)(ii) under any outstanding Company Options, including any actions
required by the Plan. Parent covenants to deliver or cause to be delivered
the Vested Option Consideration in cash to the Company on the Closing Date,
provided that a portion thereof will be withheld in accordance with Section
1.2(d)(i). Company, Parent and Sub agree that it is their common intention to
waive any entitlement to a deduction for Canadian Tax purposes in respect of
the payment of the Vested Option Consideration, in accordance with subsection
110(1.1) of the ITA. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Parent and Sub
hereby covenant and agree with the Shareholders and the Company that the
Parent and Sub (a) shall, and shall cause the Company to, make the applicable
elections under draft paragraph 110(1.1)(a) of the ITA to forego the
deduction of payments made to retire employee stock options pursuant to
Section 1.2(e) and shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, rescind,
amend or otherwise modify or seek to nullify any such election. For greater
certainty, the obligation of the Company to pay the Vested Payment Amount will
be disregarded for the purposes of determining the Balance Sheet Adjustment
Amount, the Third Party Expense Adjustment Amount, or the Indebtedness
Adjustment Amount. 
---|---|--- 

1.3 _Withholding Taxes._ The Company and Parent, and any successor, assign or
agent thereof, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts of
cash or property payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the treatment of
Company Options pursuant to Section 1.2(e)) such amounts as may be required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of federal, local or
foreign tax law or under any applicable Legal Requirements. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid. Tax slips prepared for non-US taxpayer
employees by the Company in respect of 2011 shall reflect the full amount of
the payments made or deemed to be made to such employees, including on account
of the Vested Company Options held by such employees, and for Canadian-
resident employees will reflect the application of paragraph 110(1)(d) of the
ITA. To the extent that the Special Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund is not
released to the Shareholders and Participating Optionholders in its entirely,
the Company will

 



-13-   issue revised tax slips to all such affected employees that reflect the
final amounts received or receivable by such individuals.

1.4 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ If at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Company with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company, or to vest Sub with full right, title and possession to all of
the shares of the Company, Company, Parent, Sub, and the officers and
directors of each of the Company, Parent and Sub are fully authorized in the
name of their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all
such lawful and necessary action.

 

1.5 _Aged Accounts Receivable Adjustment_. For the period between Closing and
January 31, 2012 (such period, the "Receivable Adjustment Period"), the
Company shall use commercially best efforts to calculate and record the
collection of the Aged Accounts Receivable set out in the Statement of Aged
Accounts Receivable. By March 31, 2012, the Company shall provide a report to
the Shareholder Representative on the amount actually collected for each of
the Aged Accounts Receivable set out in the Statement of Aged Accounts
Receivable during the Receivable Adjustment Period (the "AAR Report").
Subject to any set-off permitted pursuant to Section 8.3(a) hereof, unless
objected to by the Shareholder Representative in writing prior to April 30,
2012, Parent shall remit to Shareholder Representative or to its designee
(including, in the case of the Participating Optionholders, if designated by
the Shareholder Representative, to the Company for the account of the
Participating Optionholders), for distribution to the Shareholders and
Participating Optionholders in their Pro Rata Portions, all proceeds from
collection of Aged Accounts Receivable actually received by the Company during
the Receivable Adjustment Period, net of any costs and expenses (other than
overhead, administrative or internal office charges) incurred in connection
with such collection. An Aged Accounts Receivable is considered as actually
received only if and to the extent that an account debtor for Aged Accounts
Receivable (the "Aged Debtors") designates with or in connection with any
payment that such payment is to be applied to the corresponding invoice
associated with such Aged Accounts Receivable; provided that if the amount of
payment exceeds $10,000, the Company will be obliged to contact the Aged
Debtor to confirm whether the payment was on account of the Aged Account
Receivable and, if so confirmed, such amount of Aged Account Receivable shall
be deemed as actually received. Any payments made to a Shareholder
or Participating Optionholder pursuant to this Section 1.5 will be treated as
adjustments to the Adjusted Share Consideration or Vested Option
Consideration, as applicable, for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will
govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by law.
Within (thirty) 30 days of the delivery of the AAR Report to the Shareholder
Representative, the Shareholder Representative may issue a written notice of
objection to the AAR Report, in which case the provisions and procedures of
Section 8.8, read _mutatis mutandis_ , shall apply to such objection and the
review and resolution of the objection, and the determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm in that regard shall be final and binding on the
Parties in respect of the Aged Accounts Receivable adjustment amount, provided
that the costs of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the
Shareholders and Participating Optionholders.

standing under the laws of the Province of New Brunswick. The Company has the

good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the
character or location of its assets or properties (whether owned, leased or
licensed) or the nature of its business make such qualifications necessary,
except where failure to so qualify would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has Made Available a true and
correct copy of its certificate and articles of incorporation, as amended to
date (the "Certificate of Incorporation") and bylaws, as amended to date, each

which the Company has Employees or facilities or Material Customers.

2.2 _Company Capital Structure_

(a) The authorized capital of the Company consists of an unlimited number of
Common Shares, of which 3,350,000 shares are issued and outstanding, an
unlimited number of Class A Preferred Shares, of which 4,000,000 shares are
issued and outstanding, an unlimited number of Class B Preferred Shares, of
which 3,206,244 shares are issued and outstanding, and an unlimited number of
Company Non-Voting Common Shares, of which, as of the date hereof, no shares
are issued and outstanding. The Company Shares are held by the Persons and in
the amounts set forth in Section 2.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule which
further sets forth for each such Person the number and class of shares held,
the number of the applicable share certificates representing such shares, and
the domicile addresses of such Persons and an indication of whether each
such Person is or is not a U.S. Person. Section 2.2(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule will be updated to reflect any exercises of

 



-15-   Company Options between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
as mutually agreed to by the Company and Parent. All outstanding Company
Shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and
are not subject to preemptive rights created by statute, the Charter
Documents, or any agreement to which the Company is a party or by which it is
bound, other than the Amended and Restated Unanimous Shareholder Agreement
dated December 5, 2008 and other than Section 27 of the _Business Corporations
Act_ (New Brunswick).

(b) All outstanding Company Shares and Company Options have been issued or
granted in compliance with all applicable federal, provincial, foreign, or
local statutes, laws, rules, or regulations, including securities laws, and
were issued or transferred, as the case may be, in accordance with any right
of first refusal or similar right or limitation Known to the Company,
including those in the Charter Documents, the Management Agreement dated
August 11, 2006, the Unanimous Shareholder Agreement dated April 24, 2007,
and the Amended and Restated Unanimous Shareholder Agreement dated December 5,
2008. There are no declared or accrued but unpaid dividends with respect to
any of the Company Shares. Other than the Company Shares set forth in Section
2.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, the Company has no authorized, issued or

(c) Except for the Plan, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
ever adopted, sponsored or maintained any stock option plan or any other plan
or agreement providing for equity-related compensation to any person (whether
payable in shares, cash or otherwise). The Company has reserved 3,614,000
Company Non-Voting Common Shares for issuance to employees and directors of,
and consultants to, the Company and its Affiliated Entities (as defined in the
Plan) upon the exercise of options granted under the Plan, of which, as of

granted under the Plan, (ii) no Company Non-Voting Common Shares have been

exercise of such option, the date of grant of such option, the exercise price
of such option, the vesting schedule for such option, including the extent
vested to date and whether the vesting of such option is subject to
acceleration as a result of the Transaction or any other events. Each Company
Option was originally granted with an exercise price per share that the Board
of Directors of the Company in good faith, based on a reasonable valuation
method utilized at the time of grant, determined to be at least equal to the
fair market value of a Company Non-Voting Common Share on the date of grant.
The terms of the Plan and the applicable agreements for each Company Option
permit the assumption or substitution of Company Options in exchange for an
option to purchase Parent Common Stock and the termination of Company Options
as provided in this Agreement, without the consent or approval of the holders
of such securities, the Shareholders or otherwise and without any
acceleration of the exercise schedules or vesting provisions in effect for
such Company Options. True and complete copies of

 



-16-   all agreements and instruments relating to or issued under the Plan have
been Made Available and such agreements and instruments have not been amended,
modified or supplemented, and there are no agreements to amend, modify or
supplement such agreements or instruments from the forms thereof Made
Available. All holders of Company Options are current employees or non-

Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth above by any

request, and (iii) all Employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
identified by Parent. The Company agrees to provide to Parent and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives copies of internal financial
statements (including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) promptly upon
request. No information or knowledge obtained in any investigation pursuant to
this Section 6.1 or otherwise shall affect or be deemed to 

 



-62-   modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the Transaction in accordance
with the terms and provisions hereof. 

6.2 _Confidentiality._ Each of the Shareholders shall keep confidential and
shall not disclose (other than to its representatives on a need-to-know
basis) the information obtained in any investigation pursuant to Section 6.1
hereof, or pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the
effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In this regard, the
Company and each Party acknowledges that Parent Common Stock is publicly
traded and that any information obtained during the course of its due
diligence could be considered to be material non-public information within the
meaning of federal and state securities laws. Accordingly, the Company and
the Shareholders acknowledge and agree not to engage in any discussions,
correspondence or transactions in Parent Common Stock in violation of
applicable securities laws. The Parties acknowledge that the confidentiality
obligations set forth herein shall not extend to information, knowledge and
data that is publicly available or becomes publicly available through no act
or omission of any Party or becomes available on a non-confidential basis
from a source other than a Party owing a duty of confidentiality so long as
such source is not known by any Party to be bound by a confidentiality
agreement with or other obligations of secrecy to a Party or required to
be disclosed by a Government Entity. The Parties hereby agree that the
confidentiality obligations outlined in this Section 6.2 shall be in addition
to, and not in substitution for, the Confidentiality Agreement dated as of May
6, 2010 (the "Confidential Disclosure Agreement"), between the Company and
Parent. In the event of a breach of the confidentiality obligations hereunder
by any Party, the injured Party, in addition to all other available remedies,
will be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this
Section in any court of competent jurisdiction. For greater certainty, the
Parties agree that the institutional Shareholders may disclose information
hereunder to the extent that their reporting obligations to their investors
require communications provide that such communications will contain no more
information regarding the subject matter of this Agreement than is
contractually required to be disclosed (provided the name of the Parent and
Sub shall not be provided prior to the public release of the press release
announcing the Transaction)).

6.3 _Public Disclosure._ Neither the Company nor the Shareholders (other than
the institutional Shareholders to the extent of their reporting obligations to
their investors require communications which will contain no more information
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement than is contractually required
to be disclosed (provided the name of the Parent and Sub shall not be provided
prior to the public release of the press release announcing the Transaction))
nor any of their respective representatives shall issue any statement or
communication to any third party (other than its agents that are bound by
confidentiality restrictions) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, including, if applicable, the
termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor, without the consent of
Parent. Parent may issue public statements or communications in connection
with the Transaction, including a press release to announce the
transaction which will be released immediately after the signing of this
Agreement, provided that Parent has provided the Company with a reasonable
opportunity to comment on such release, statements or communications prior to
their issuance to the extent that they are issued or made prior to Closing.

 



-63-  6.4 _Reasonable Efforts._ Subject to the terms and conditions provided in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to
do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make
effective the Transaction contemplated hereby, to cause all conditions to the
obligations of the other parties hereto required to effect the Transaction to
occur, to obtain all necessary waivers, consents, approvals and other
documents required to be delivered hereunder and to effect all necessary
registrations and filings and to remove any injunctions or other impediments
or delays, legal or otherwise, in order to consummate and make effective
the Transaction for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the
benefits contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not be required to agree to (x) any license, sale or other disposition
or holding separate (through establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any
shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or properties of Parent,
its subsidiaries or affiliates or of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (y) the
imposition of any limitation on the ability of Parent, its subsidiaries or
affiliates or the Company or its Subsidiaries to conduct their respective
businesses or own any capital stock or assets or to acquire, hold or exercise
full rights of ownership of their respective businesses and, in the case of
Parent, the businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (z) the
imposition of any impediment on Parent, its subsidiaries or affiliates or the
Company or its Subsidiaries under any statute, rule, regulation, executive
order, decree, order or other legal restraint governing competition,
monopolies or restrictive trade practices (any such action described in (x),
(y) or (z), an "Action of Divestiture"). Nothing herein shall require Parent
to litigate with any Governmental Entity.

6.5 _Notification of Certain Matters._ Each of the Company, on the one hand,
and the Parent, on the other hand, shall give prompt notice to the other party
of: (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event, the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the
notifying party to be untrue or inaccurate such that the conditions set forth
in Article VII would not be satisfied, and (ii) any failure of the notifying
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder such that the conditions set
forth in Article VII would not be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.5 shall not (A) limit or
otherwise affect any remedies available to the party receiving such notice or
(B) constitute an acknowledgment or admission of a breach of this Agreement.
No disclosure by a Party pursuant to this Section 6.5, however, shall
be deemed, in the case of the Company, to amend or supplement the Disclosure
Schedule, or, in the case of the Company or the Parent, prevent or cure any
misrepresentations, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by such Party.

 

6.6 _Additional Documents and Further Assurances._ Each party hereto, at the
request of another party hereto, shall execute and deliver such other

in respect of the Participating Optionholders. Any materials to be submitted
to the holders of Company Options in connection with the notice required under
this Section 6.8 shall be subject to prior review and approval by Parent.

6.9 _No Acceleration of Company Options._ The Board of Directors of the
Company shall not accelerate the vesting of any Company Options _provided
that_ it is acknowledged by Diamond that certain Company Options issued prior
to the date hereof will be automatically accelerated in accordance with their
terms upon Closing of the Transaction, and such acceleration shall not
constitute a breach of this Section 6.9. 

6.10 _Participating Optionholder Intervention._ The Company shall use its best
commercial efforts to cause each Participating Optionholder or its duly
authorised agent (including, for greater certainty, the Company pursuant to
the Plan), who is not already a party to this Agreement, to have entered into
and executed, prior to Closing, an instrument (the "Participating
Optionholder Instrument") (in form and content reasonably acceptable to
Parent) pursuant to which the Participating Optionholder irrevocably agrees to
be bound by and to adhere to the applicable terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

6.11 _General Consents._ The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary consents, modifications, waivers and approvals of any
parties to any Contract as are required thereunder in connection with the
Transaction or for any such Contract to remain in full force and effect. Such
consents, modifications, waivers and approvals shall be in a commercially
reasonable form acceptable to Parent. In the event the Transaction does not
close for any reason (other than for termination of this Agreement by the
Company as a result of a material breach by Parent of its
representations, warranties or covenants hereunder), neither Parent nor Sub
shall have any liability to the Company, the Shareholders or any other Person
for any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the Company
seeking to obtain such consents, modifications, waivers and approvals.

coverage for current and former directors and officers and, if available,
shareholders of the Company on "trailing" or "run-off" basis,

 



-65-   for such duration no less than (six) 6 years as the Shareholder
Representative and the Parent may agree, on terms and conditions that are
satisfactory to the Shareholder Representative and Parent, each acting
reasonably (but in any event, no worse than the terms currently in place as to
amount and scope of coverage and deductible amount), such insurance coverage
and the policies thereof to be fully pre-paid by the Company prior to
the Effective Time.

6.14 _IP Rights Assignments and Waivers for Independent Contractors_. The
Company shall use its best commercial efforts to obtain prior to Closing a

of no further force or effect immediately following the Effective Time. The
form and substance of such termination letter shall be provided by Parent and
approved by the Company. Upon the Closing, the Company shall have paid all
amounts owed under the Terminated Agreements (as a result of the
termination of the Terminated Agreements or otherwise), and the Company will
not incur any claim, liability or obligation (absolute, accrued, asserted or
unasserted, contingent or otherwise) under any Terminated Agreement following
the Closing Date. The Company shall be responsible for making any payments
required to terminate the Terminated Agreements and shall reflect such payment
or other consideration incurred by the Company as of the Closing Date or
anticipated to be incurred or payable after the Closing on the Statement of
Expenses. In the event the Transaction does not close for any reason, Parent
shall not have any liability to the Company, the Shareholders or any other
Person for any costs, claims, liabilities or damages resulting from the
Company seeking to obtain such terminations.

6.16 _Proprietary Information and Inventions Assignment Agreement._ The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each current
employee of the Company and its Subsidiary, who is not already a party to such
an agreement, to have entered into and executed, and each person who becomes

to the Closing shall be required by the Company to enter into and execute, an
Employee Proprietary Information Agreement with the Company effective as of
such employees first date of employment or service in the form of the
Employee Proprietary Information Agreement. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each current consultant or contractor of the
Company, who is not already a party to such an agreement or an agreement on
substantially similar terms, to have entered into and executed, and each
Person who becomes a consultant or contractor of the Company or the Subsidiary
after the date hereof and prior to the Closing shall be required by the
Company to enter into and execute, a Consultant Proprietary Information
Agreement with the Company and each of its Subsidiaries effective as of such

extended an offer of employment to all Other Employees in the form
substantially similar to the form previously delivered to the Company (an
"Offer Letter") to become an employee of Parent or Sub effective on the first
Business Day after the Closing, on such terms and conditions reasonably
acceptable to Parent or Sub in compliance with applicable laws, including the
terms set out in Section 6.17 of the Disclosure Schedule, and no less
favourable, in the aggregate, than the terms applicable to such Other
Employees immediately prior to Closing.

6.18 _Payment of Accrued Amounts._ All vacation and/or paid time off that has
been accrued but unused as at the Closing Date by any of the Employees, as
well as accrued wages, pro-rated bonuses and other accrued but unpaid benefits

prior to the Closing.

6.19 _S-8 Registration._ On or immediately following the Closing, Parent
agrees to file with the SEC (at its sole expense) a registration statement on
Form S-8, if available for use by Parent, registering that number of shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of all Company Options assumed by Parent pursuant
to Section 1.2(e)(i) hereof that are eligible to be registered on Form S-8.

6.20 _S-3 Registration._

(a) Parent agrees to file with the SEC (at its sole expense) a registration
statement on Form S-3 (the "S-3 Registration Statement"), if available for
use by Parent, registering the resale by the Shareholders of that number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable at Closing on account of the Aggregate Parent Stock
Consideration. Parent shall file the S-3 Registration Statement:



     | (i) | on or immediately following the Closing Date, if the Closing
occurs on a date prior to the commencement of the "no trade period" (the
"Quiet Period") pursuant to Parents insider trading policy (the "Blackout
Policy") preceding the date (the "Earnings Announcement Date") of Parents
announcement of its earnings for the period ended April 30, 2011 (the
"Earnings Announcement"), 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | on the fifth trading day on the New York Stock Exchange
after the Earnings Announcement Date, if the Closing occurs on a date during
the Quiet Period; or  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | on or immediately following the Closing Date, if Closing
occurs after the fifth trading day on the New York Stock Exchange after the
Earnings Announcement Date;  
---|---|--- 

(the applicable date by which the S-3 Registration Statement is to be filed,
if available for use by Parent, pursuant to this sentence, the "S-3 Due
Date"). Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the S-3
Registration Statement continuously effective until all shares of Parent
Common Stock covered thereby have been sold or are eligible for sale under
Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act without any limitation as to
volume. Parent shall notify the Shareholders

 



-67-   (other than the Founders) and the Shareholder Representative, promptly after
it shall receive notice thereof, of the date and time the S-3 Registration
Statement and each post-effective amendment to such S-3 Registration
Statement becomes effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part
of such S-3 Registration Statement has been filed; and Parent shall take all
reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent within three (3) Business Days
after delivery of a customary written request by a Shareholder or its broker
(accompanied by customary supporting representation letters and similar
materials, including such materials customarily required for delivery of
an opinion of Parent counsel) upon the sale by such Shareholder of any shares
of Parent Common Stock constituting Per Share Parent Stock Consideration that
are sold pursuant to the effective S-3 Registration Statement to remove the
book entry restrictions containing the substance of the legends described in
Section 3.8 hereof with respect to such shares, if applicable (including
without limitation taking all reasonable efforts to cause its counsel to issue
customary opinions upon receipt of customary supporting materials from the
applicable Shareholder and its broker), and otherwise facilitate the movement
of such shares from restricted to unrestricted accounts at the request of any
Shareholder upon such sale , and to promptly respond to any reasonable
brokers inquiries in connection therewith made of Parent and to take such
other reasonable and customary steps in connection therewith (such as using
all reasonable efforts to cause its transfer agent to be reasonably available
for conference calls and otherwise coordinate directly with brokers) as are
within Parents control in connection with such sales, in each case with a
view to reasonably assisting the Shareholders to complete such sale during
such period of effectiveness.

(b) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each Shareholder whose shares of
Parent Common Stock are included in the S-3 Registration Statement, each of
its officers, directors and partners and each person controlling such
Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, from and
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which such Shareholder,
or any such officer, director, partner or controlling person may become
subject (under the Securities Act or otherwise) insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof)
arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the S-3 Registration Statement or any omission to state therein a
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not
misleading, and Parent will reimburse each such Shareholder and each of its
officers, directors and partners and each person controlling such Shareholder,
as the case may be, for any reasonable legal and any other expenses
reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending
any such loss, claim, damage or liability; _provided, however,_ that Parent
will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage or liability arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or
omission, made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to Parent by or on behalf of such Shareholder specifically for use
in the preparation of the S-3 Registration Statement, or (ii) the failure of
such Shareholder to comply with the covenants and agreements applicable to
such Shareholder.

 

(c) Each Shareholder shall, if such Shareholders shares of Parent Common
Stock are included in the S-3 Registration Statement, severally as to
such Shareholder only and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Parent,
each of its officers, directors and partners and each person controlling
Parent

 



-68-   within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, from and against any
losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which Parent, or any such officer,
director, partner or controlling person may become subject (under the
Securities Act or otherwise) to the extent that (i) such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise
out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement of a material fact contained
in the S-3 Registration Statement or any omission to state therein a fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading (as such,
an " _S-3 Misstatement or Omission_ "), and (ii) such S-3 Misstatement or
Omission is made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished
to Parent in writing by such Shareholder and stated by such Shareholder to be
for the specific purpose of use in such S-3 Registration Statement, and
subject to the foregoing such Shareholder will reimburse Parent and each of
its officers, directors and partners and each person controlling Parent, as
the case may be, for any reasonable legal and any other expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with investigating, preparing or defending any such
loss, claim, damage or liability; _provided, however,_ that the several
liability of each Shareholder under this Section 6.20(c) shall be limited to
an amount equal to the net proceeds of the shares sold by such Shareholder
hereunder, unless such liability arises out of or is based on fraud or
intentional misconduct by such Shareholder. Each Shareholder shall furnish in
writing to Parent, acknowledging that such information is for the specific
purpose of use in the S-3 Registration Statement, such customary information
regarding such Shareholder, the shares of Parent Common Stock held by it and
the distribution proposed by such Shareholder as Parent may reasonably request
and as shall be reasonably required in connection with the S-3 Registration
Statement.

 

(d) Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.20 (the "S-3
Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "S-3 Indemnifying Party") promptly after such S-3
Indemnified Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may
be sought, and shall permit the S-3 Indemnifying Party to assume the defense
of any such claim or any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel
for the S-3 Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or
litigation, shall be approved by the S-3 Indemnified Party (whose approval
shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the S-3 Indemnified Party may
participate in such defense at such partys expense, and provided further that
the failure of any S-3 Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein
shall not relieve the S-3 Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
Agreement unless the failure to file such notice is materially prejudicial to
an S-3 Indemnifying Partys ability to defend such action and provided
further, that the S-3 Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense for
matters as to which there is a conflict of interest or there are separate and
different defenses. No S-3 Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such
claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each S-3 Indemnified
Party (whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), consent to entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
S-3 Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim
or litigation. The provisions of this Section 6.20 shall govern any
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.20, notwithstanding the provisions
of Article VIII or any other provisions hereof.

 



-69-  (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6.20 but subject
to Section 6.20(i), if the filing, initial effectiveness or continued use of
the S-3 Registration Statement at any time would require Parent to make an
Adverse Disclosure, then Parent may, upon giving written notice of such to
the Shareholder Representative, delay the filing or initial effectiveness of,
or suspend use of, the S-3 Registration Statement, provided that Parent shall
not be permitted to do so for more than 90 days in the aggregate. In the event
that Parent exercises its rights under the preceding sentence, the
Shareholders agree to immediately suspend their use of the S-3 Registration
Statement and any prospectus thereunder in connection with any sale or offer
to sell Parent Common Stock. Parent agrees to end its delay of filing or
initial effectiveness or suspension of use of the S-3 Registration Statement
as provided in this Section 6.20(e) promptly after the termination of any
requirement to make an Adverse Disclosure giving rise to such a delay or
suspension.

(f) In the event that (i) the Closing occurs during the Quiet Period, and (ii)
the Quiet Period Trading Price is equal to or less than 80% of the Parent
Trading Price, then Parent will, within 30 days of the date on which the S-3
Registration Statement is filed, pay to each Shareholder (other than Founders
and any other Shareholder who was subject to the Blackout Policy applicable
in respect of the earnings announced on the Earnings Announcement Date) at the
account designated by such Shareholder an amount equal to its S-3 Pro Rata
Portion of an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (x) $10,000,000, and
(y) the amount determined by the following formula:

[(0.8 x Parent Trading Price)  Quiet Period Trading Price] x [Aggregate
Parent Stock Consideration  Number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued at
Closing to the Founders and any other Shareholder who was subject to the
Blackout Policy applicable in respect of the earnings announced on the
Earnings Announcement Date]

(g) Parent shall promptly notify (i) prior to Closing, the Company, or (ii)
after Closing until such time as Parent is no longer required to maintain the
effectiveness of the S-3 Registration Statement, the Shareholders and the
Shareholder Representative, if in either case it becomes aware of any Adverse
Disclosure. The Company, each Shareholder and the Shareholder Representative
shall keep the fact that Parent has given notice of an Adverse Disclosure or
otherwise suspended the filing or use of the S-3 Registration Statement
pursuant to Section 6.20(e) and any non-public information provided by Parent
in connection therewith, confidential, shall not disclose or reveal any such
information to any person or entity and shall not use such information for
securities trading or any other purpose.

 

(h) Without limiting Parents obligations herein, each Shareholder agrees that
until the end of the six-month period following the Closing, such Shareholder
and its agents and representatives have not, and will not, solicit offers to
buy, offer for sale, sell or engage in hedging transaction with regard to any
of Parent Common Stock to be acquired by such Shareholder pursuant to
this Agreement or any beneficial interest therein unless such solicitation,
offer, sale or engagement in hedging transactions was or is made pursuant to
an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or an exemption
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.

(i) If,

 



-70-  by Parent or an Adverse Disclosure exists which prevents filing of the S-3
Registration Statement;  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | the S-3 Registration is filed and becomes effective, but
after the S-3 Due Date, the S-3 Registration is suspended at any time before
it has been effective for at least 15 consecutive calendar days, 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | the effectiveness of the S-3 Registration Statement is
suspended pursuant to Section 6.20(e), other than a suspension under clause
(ii) above, and such suspension continues for a period of more than (ninety)
90 days, 
---|---|--- 

Parent shall in any such event promptly give written notice of such event to
the Shareholders (other than the Founders) and the Shareholder Representative
(an "S-3 Unavailability Notice"). Following receipt of an S-3 Unavailability
Notice, the Shareholders shall transfer and deliver to Parent the shares of
Parent Common Stock constituting the Per Share Parent Stock Consideration
(which, for greater certainty, are the restricted shares of Parent Company
Stock received at Closing, and no other shares of Parent Company Stock),
duly endorsed for transfer to Parent, together with such other transfer
documentation reasonably requested by Parent at the time of its delivery of
the S-3 Unavailability Notice, as promptly as practicable and, in any event,
within (ten) 10 Business Days of the date of the S-3 Unavailability Notice.
Subject to receipt of such shares of Parent Common Stock and related
documentation and compliance with applicable law, Parent will promptly pay or
cause to be paid to each of the Shareholders, an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the Parent Trading Price multiplied by the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock so transferred to Parent and Parent shall thereupon
have no further obligations to such Shareholders pursuant to this Section
6.20.

6.21 _Closing Date Balance Sheet._ The Company shall prepare and deliver the
Closing Date Balance Sheet not less than three Business Days prior to the
Closing Date and shall cause the Closing Date Balance Sheet to be attached to
this Agreement. The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall set forth the Closing
Date Balance Sheet Indebtedness. Any indebtedness for borrowed money, amounts
payable pursuant to capital leases of the Company or guarantees of
indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
(including principal, accrued and unpaid interest on all such indebtedness
and any penalties or premiums that would be associated with the full repayment
and retirement of such indebtedness) that is not reflected on the Closing Date
Balance Sheet and thus not part of the Indebtedness Adjustment Amount, if
any ("Excess Debt"), shall be paid to Parent and shall not be limited to the
Threshold Amount or the Deductible Amount. Any Aged Accounts Receivable of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date that is not reflected on
the Statement of Aged Accounts Receivable, if any ("Excess Overdue AR"),
shall be paid to Parent if, and only to the extent that, such Excess Overdue
AR causes the Balance Sheet Adjustment Amount to be greater than zero, and
shall not be limited to the Threshold Amount or the Deductible Amount. Parent
shall have the right to require that the Excess Debt and Excess Overdue AR be
paid to it (i) first, as an offset from any amount payable under the Aged
Accounts Receivable 

 



-71-   Adjustment pursuant to Section 1.5 hereof and (ii) thereafter from (A) the
Escrow Fund or (B) the Shareholders and Participating Optionholders based on
their respective Pro Rata Portion.

6.22 _Expenses_

(a) Whether or not the Transaction is consummated, each party shall be
responsible for its own expenses and costs that it incurs with respect to the
negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement. Without
limiting or expanding the foregoing, the Company shall be responsible for all
fees and expenses incurred by or on its behalf in connection with the
Transaction including:

 



     | (i) | all legal, accounting, tax, financial advisory, consulting,
finders and all other fees and expenses of third parties incurred by the
Company in connection with the negotiation and implementation of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
("Transaction Expenses"); 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | any termination, pre-payments, balloon or similar payments
(including penalties) of the Company on account of outstanding debt of the
Company or resulting from the early termination of Contracts resulting from,
or in connection with, the Transaction ("Debt Expenses"); 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | any bonus, severance, change-in-control payments or
similar payment obligations (including payments with either "single-trigger"
or "double-trigger" provisions) of the Company to employees, consultants or
other service providers resulting from, or in connection with, the Transaction
arising other than as a result of actions taken by the Company, Parent or Sub
after the Closing Date ("Employee Payments"); and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | any payments in connection with any change in control
obligations resulting from or in connection with the Transaction, or any
payment or consideration arising under any consents, waivers or approvals of
any party under any Contract of the Company as are required in connection with
the Transaction for any such agreement to remain in full force and effect
following the Closing or resulting from agreed-upon modification or early
termination of contracts ("Change in Control Payments" and collectively with
the Transaction Expenses, the Debt Expenses and the Employee Payments, the
"Third Party Expenses").  
---|---|--- 

(b) The Company shall provide Parent with a statement of Estimated Third Party
Expenses showing detail of both the unpaid Third Party Expenses incurred by
the Company as of the Closing Date, or anticipated to be incurred or payable
by the Company after the Closing on the basis of actions taken or instructions
given by the Company prior to Closing, not less than three Business Days
prior to the Closing Date in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent (the
"Statement of Expenses"). The Statement of Expenses will reflect all unpaid
Third Party Expenses incurred or expected to be incurred by the Company as a
result of the negotiation and effectuation of this Agreement and the
Transaction (including any Third Party Expenses anticipated to be incurred
after the Closing on the basis of actions taken or instructions given by the
Company prior to Closing).

 



-72-   Any Third Party Expenses incurred by the Company that are not reflected on
the Statement of Expenses, and thus are not part of the Third Party Expense
Adjustment Amount, if any ("Excess Third Party Expenses"), shall be paid to
Parent and shall not be limited by the Threshold Amount or the Deductible
Amount. Parent shall have the right to require that the Excess Third Party
Expenses be paid to it (i) first, as an offset from any amount payable under
the Aged Accounts Receivable Adjustment pursuant to Section 1.5 hereof and
(ii) thereafter from (A) from the Escrow Fund, or (B) from the Shareholders
and Participating Optionholders directly based on their respective Pro Rata
Portion.

(c) The Company shall take all necessary action to ensure that Third Party
Expenses shall not be incurred by the Company after the Closing Date without
the express prior written consent of Parent unless accounted for as current
liabilities in the Closing Date Balance Sheet. No Subsidiary shall incur any
Third Party Expenses.

 

6.23 _Spreadsheet._ The Company shall deliver to Parent a spreadsheet (the
"Spreadsheet") in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, which spreadsheet
shall be certified as complete and correct by the Chief Executive Officer of
the Company as of the Closing and which shall include as of the Closing, (i)
all Shareholders and their respective addresses, indicating whether such
holder is a current or former employee of the Company, the number and type of
Company Shares held by such Shareholder, the respective certificate numbers of
Company Shares issued to such Shareholder, the date of acquisition of such
Company Shares, Per Share Cash Consideration and Per Share Parent Stock
Consideration to be paid to such Shareholder, the Pro Rata Portion of each
Shareholder, the Preferred Share Preference Per Share amount to be paid to
such Shareholder, if any, the S-3 Pro Rata Portion of each Shareholder, the
amount of cash to be deposited into the Escrow Fund on behalf of such
Shareholder pursuant to Section 1.2(d), and (ii) all holders of Company
Options and their respective addresses, whether such holder is an employee,
consultant, director or officer of the Company or of an Affiliated Entity (as
defined in the Plan), the number of Company Non-Voting Common Shares
underlying each such Company Option, the grant dates of such Company Options,
the vesting schedule with respect to such Company Options, the strike price
for each such Company Option, the Option Exchange Ratio, the aggregate
Unvested Option Consideration, the number of Parent Options issuable pursuant
to Section 1.2(e)(i) to each holder of Company Options that are outstanding,
unvested and in-the-money immediately prior to the Effective Time, the portion
of the Vested Option Consideration payable to each holder of Company Options
that are outstanding, vested and in-the-money immediately prior to the
Effective Time and if the holder of the Company Option is a Participating
Optionholder, the amount of cash to be deposited into the Escrow Fund on
behalf of such Participating Optionholder pursuant to Section 1.2(d) and the
Pro Rata Portion of such Participating Optionholder. The Company shall deliver
the Spreadsheet three Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

 

6.24 _Release of Liens._ The Company shall file, or shall have filed, all
agreements, instruments, certificates and other documents, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, that are necessary or appropriate
to effect the release of all Liens set forth in Section 6.24 of the Disclosure
Schedule other than Liens for equipment leases in the ordinary course. 

 



-73-  6.25 _FIRPTA Compliance._ On the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a properly executed statement in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent for purposes of satisfying Parents obligations under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1445-2(c)(3).

6.26 _Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date._ The Company shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns
of the Company for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date
("Pre-Closing Taxable Periods") that have not been filed prior to the Closing
Date. The Company shall permit the Shareholder Representative or its agents to
review and comment on each such Tax Return described in the prior sentence at
least 10 days prior to filing and shall make such revisions as are requested
by the Shareholder Representative to such Tax Returns provided such revisions
would not cause adverse consequences for a post-closing taxable period in the
sole discretion of the Company. The Shareholders shall be responsible for all
Taxes that relate to Pre-Closing Taxable Periods as determined under this
Section 6.26, including, without limitation, Taxes resulting from any Contest
and any amounts required to be paid in order for a Contest to proceed, and
shall pay to (or as directed by) the Company amounts equal to such Taxes or
other amounts and such payments shall be made in each applicable case by no
later than ten (10) business days prior to the due date for paying such amount
to the relevant Governmental Entity, provided that all such amounts ultimately
refunded to the Company shall be for the account of the Shareholders
and Participating Optionholders and the Company shall repay such amounts to
the Shareholders and Participating Optionholders promptly upon receipt. All
Tax Returns to be prepared pursuant to this Section 6.26 shall be prepared in
a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company, except as
otherwise required by law.

6.27 _Tax Periods That Include But Do Not End on the Closing Date._ The
Company shall cause to be prepared and filed any Tax Returns of the Company
for taxable periods that include but do not end on the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period"). The Shareholders shall be responsible for the portions of
such Taxes which relate to the portions of such taxable periods ending on the
Closing Date (which portion shall be treated as a Pre-Closing Taxable Period),
without limitation, Taxes resulting from any Contest, and shall pay to (or as
directed by) the Company any such Taxes of the Company except to the extent
that such Taxes are taken into account in the final determination of the
Balance Sheet Adjustment Amount. Such payments shall be made no later than
ten (10) business days prior to the due date for paying such amount of Taxes
to the relevant Governmental Entity. For purposes of this Section 6.27, in the
case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for
a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of
such taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall (a) in the case of any
Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Tax
Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Straddle Period, and (b) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to
income or receipts, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if
the relevant Taxable period ended at the close of business on the Closing
Date. Any credits relating to a Straddle Period shall be allocated on a basis
consistent with the allocations made pursuant to the preceding sentence.

 



-74-  6.28 _Cooperation on Tax Matters._ The Parent and the Company shall cooperate
fully, to the extent reasonably requested by the others, in connection with
the filing of any Tax Returns, and any audit, litigation, or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return filing, audit, litigation, or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder.

6.29 _Refunds and Credits._ Any refund or credit of Taxes of the Company
directly attributable to a Pre-Closing Taxable Period, to the extent not on
the Closing Date Balance Sheet, shall be for the account of Shareholders and
Participating Optionholders. All other refunds or credits with respect to
Taxes shall be for the account of the Company.

6.30 _Control of Audits_. After the Closing Date, except as set forth in the
next sentence, the Company shall control the conduct, through counsel of its
own choosing, of any audit, claim for refund, or administrative or judicial
proceeding involving any asserted Tax liability or refund with respect to the
Company (each, a "Contest"). In the case of a Contest after the Closing Date
that relates solely to Pre-Closing Taxable Periods and in respect of which the
Shareholders acknowledge their liability pursuant to Article VIII, the Company
shall control the conduct of such Contest, but the Shareholders and
Participating Optionholders, through the Shareholder Representative, shall
have the right to participate in such Contest at their own expense. The
Company has full authority to settle, compromise and/or concede any portion
of such Contest without the written consent of the Shareholders and
Participating Optionholders; provided that such settlement, compromise and/or
concession shall not be determinative of the indemnification obligations of
the Shareholders and Participating Optionholders as set forth in Article
VIII. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the terms of Section 8.6(a)(ii)
shall apply to a Contest, _mutatis mutandis_.

 



   6.31 | _Post Closing Covenants of the Parent._ 
---|--- 

(a) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Company or
its successor shall fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to any indemnification provisions under applicable law, the
Charter Documents and the documents listed in Section 6.31(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule as in effect on the date hereof insofar as such
indemnification provisions relate to the directors and officers of the
Company (such directors and officers being herein referred to as the "Company
Indemnitees"). The rights of each Company Indemnitee shall be enforceable by
each such Company Indemnitee or his or her heirs, personal representatives,
successors or assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of the
Company or its successor (i) shall be subject to any limitation imposed by
applicable Legal Requirements and (ii) shall not be deemed to release any
Company Indemnitee who is also an officer or director of the Company from his
or her obligations pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement, nor
shall such Company Indemnitee have any right of contribution, indemnification
or right of advancement from the Company or its successor with respect with
any Loss claimed by any of the Indemnified Parties against such Company
Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a Shareholder or Participating 

 



-75-   Optionholder pursuant to this Agreement or any Related Agreement. The
Company hereby represents to Parent that no claim for indemnification has been
made as of the date hereof by any director or officer of the Company.

(b) The Parent hereby covenants and agrees with the Shareholders that, during
the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is 6
years from the Closing, it shall not take any actions to cancel, terminate,
supplement, amend or let lapse the directors and officers and errors and
omissions insurance policies referred to in Section 6.13 without the prior
written consent of the Shareholder Representative, such policies having been
fully pre-paid by the Company prior to the Closing.

6.32 _Specified Matters._ The Company shall take the steps required in Section
6.32 of the Disclosure Schedule.

"Survival Date"), other than the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Section 2.15 (Intellectual Property) which shall survive
for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the Closing Date (the date of
expiration of such twenty-four (24) month period, the "Extended Survival
Date"), and shall in all cases thereafter terminate (except with respect to
any claim asserted prior to the Survival Date or Extended Survival Date);
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in the event of fraud or wilful or
intentional misrepresentation with respect to a representation or warranty,
such representation or warranty shall survive indefinitely, (ii) the

survive indefinitely, and (iii) the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in Section 2.12 (Tax Matters) shall survive until 90 days
following the expiration of the applicable period for reassessment under
applicable law (after giving effect to any extensions or waivers) (the
representations and warranties set out in (ii) and (iii) above being together
referred to as the "Special Representations and Warranties").

 

(b) The representations and warranties of Parent and Sub contained in this
Agreement, the Related Agreements or in any certificate or other
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, shall survive until the
Survival Date.

(c) For purposes hereof, fraud, wilful or intentional misrepresentation by
any member of the Knowledge Group with respect to any of the representations
or warranties of the Company in Article II of this Agreement shall be deemed
to be fraud, wilful or intentional misrepresentation by the Company
in respect of such representations and warranties and the Parent Indemnified
Parties may pursue indemnification for such Company fraud, wilful or
intentional misrepresentation from the Shareholder Indemnifying Parties in
accordance with the terms of this Article VIII.

8.2(a)(x) of the Disclosure Schedule which shall firstly be claimed from the
Escrow Fund and then secondly from the Special Escrow Fund, until (i) the
Survival Date (except with respect to any claim

 



-80-   asserted prior to the Survival Date), in the cases of claims for Losses
based on all representations and warranties of the Company (other than as set
forth in (ii)) and (ii) the Extended Survival Date (except with respect to

of the Company contained in Section 2.15 (Intellectual Property), (B) the
Special Representations and Warranties, (C) fraud, wilful or intentional
misrepresentation and (D) the matters listed in Section 8.2(a) other than
Sections 8.2(a)(i) and 8.2(a)(ii).

(e) It is the intention of the Parties that the Special Escrow Fund shall be
solely available for the funding of claims for Losses pursuant to this
Article VIII in respect of matters set forth in Section 8.2(a)(x) of the
Disclosure Schedule, until the Extended Survival Date, and only to the extent
the Escrow Fund has been exhausted.

_provided_ that, in the event of any such breach or inaccuracy, for purposes
of determining the amount of any Loss, no effect will be given to any

contained therein, it being understood that such qualifications shall be given
effect for purposes of determining whether a breach or inaccuracy exists or
has occurred),  
---|---|---

representation or warranty of such Shareholder contained in Article III of

The Shareholders (including any officer or director of the Company) shall not
have any right of contribution, indemnification or right of advancement from
the Company or Parent with respect to any Loss claimed by a Parent
Indemnified Party.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of Parent, Sub or any
other Parent Indemnified Party to pursue remedies under any Related Agreement
against the parties thereto. Parent shall have the right to withhold and
deduct any sum that may be owed by any Shareholder or Participating
Optionholder under this Article VIII from any amount (other than wages or
other employment compensation paid in the ordinary course, if applicable)
otherwise payable by Parent to such Shareholder or Participating Optionholder
if such withholding or deduction is otherwise in accordance with this
Agreement.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Shareholder or
Participating Optionholder shall be liable to Parent or Sub for any breach by
another Shareholder of any of the representations and warranties of such other
Shareholder under Article III hereof, or for such other Shareholders fraud or
willful or intentional misrepresentation (except as otherwise provided in
Section 8.1(c) hereof) or for the breach of any covenant of another
Shareholder.

 



-82-  8.3 _Limitations on Shareholder Indemnification; Remedies_

 

(a) Except in the case of fraud or wilful or intentional misrepresentation in
respect of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in
this Agreement, and except in respect of claims for breaches or inaccuracies
of the Special Representations and Warranties, claims against the Escrow Fund,
which shall be on a several basis and based on the Pro Rata Portion, shall be
the Parent Indemnified Parties sole remedy for indemnity claims under
Sections 8.2(a)(i) and 8.2(a)(xi). Claims firstly against the Escrow Fund and
secondly against the Special Escrow Fund, which shall be on a several basis
and based on the Pro Rata Portion, shall be the Parent Indemnified Parties
sole remedy for indemnity claims for Losses in respect of matters set forth in
Section 8.2(a)(x) of the Disclosure Schedule. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the first recourse of Parent or Sub for claims of indemnity pursuant to
Sections 8.2(a)(ii) to 8.2(a)(xi) shall be to offset any such proven and
completed Losses relating to such claims from amounts due and payable to the
Indemnifying Parties pursuant to Section 1.5 hereof on a Pro Rata Portion
basis if the breach is a breach of the representations and warranties under
Article II.

(b) Except in respect of claims for breaches or inaccuracies of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.4 (Authority) and
Section 3.1 (Ownership of Company Shares) made by a Shareholder on its own
account, the liability of each Shareholder and Participating Optionholder
pursuant to Section 8.2 shall be limited to a dollar amount equal to the
aggregate proceeds received by such Shareholder or Participating Optionholder
pursuant to this Agreement (including such Shareholders or Participating
Optionholders Pro Rata Portion of the Escrow Amount, any Parent Common Stock
and Parent Options issued or granted to such Shareholder or Participating
Optionholder and any portion of the Vested Option Consideration paid to such
Shareholder or Participating Optionholder); _provided_ , however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the liability of
each Shareholder and Participating Optionholder pursuant to Section 8.2 in
respect of claims for breaches or inaccuracies of the representations and
warranties contained in Section 2.12 (Tax Matters) shall be limited to a
dollar amount equal to 50% of the aggregate proceeds received by such
Shareholder or Participating Optionholder pursuant to this Agreement
(including such Shareholders or Participating Optionholders Pro Rata Portion
of the Escrow Amount, any Parent Common Stock and Parent Options issued or
granted to such Shareholder or Participating Optionholder and any portion of
the Vested Option Consideration paid to such Shareholder or Participating
Optionholder); _provided further_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the liability of any Indemnifying Party for fraud or willful or
intentional misrepresentation by such Indemnifying Party or by the Company
where the Indemnifying Party was a member of the Knowledge Group who had
actual knowledge of such fraud or willful or intentional misrepresentation by
the Company, shall be (i) with respect to the Shareholder member(s) of the
Knowledge Group (if any) who had such actual knowledge, unlimited, and (ii)
with respect to every other Shareholder and Participating Optionholder,
limited to the Pro Rata Portion of the proceeds received by such Shareholder
or Participating Optionholder under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed
a waiver by any Party of any right or remedy which such Party may have at law
or in equity based on any other Persons actual (and not implied or deemed by
operation of this Agreement) fraud, willful or

 



-83-   intentional misrepresentation under this Agreement, nor will any such
provisions limit, or be deemed to limit any Partys such right or remedy.

 

(c) Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 8.3(a) and 8.3(b), in the
case of any claim which is permitted to be made outside the Escrow Fund,
except for greater certainty for claims for breaches of Article III hereof by
a Shareholder (which shall be made solely against that Shareholder) Parent and
Sub shall be required to bring such claim against all of the Shareholders and
Participating Optionholders, and each Shareholder and Participating
Optionholder shall be liable for its Pro Rata Portion of the total liability
owed to the Parent Indemnified Parties in respect of such a claim.

 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
except in the case of fraud or wilful or intentional misrepresentation
in respect of any representation, warranty or covenant and except as set
forth in Section 8.3(e), a Parent Indemnified Party may not recover any Losses
under Section 8.2(a)(i) hereof, including, for greater certainty, claims
for Losses relating to Section 2.15 (Intellectual Property), or any Losses in
respect of matters set forth in Section 8.2(a)(x) of the Disclosure Schedule,
unless and until one or more proven and completed Losses in respect of claims
made under either Section 8.2(a)(i) or 8.2(a)(x) hereof (or Losses agreed to
between the Parent and the Shareholder Representative) collectively are in
excess of $975,000 in the aggregate (the "Threshold Amount") in which case
the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover all Losses so
identified in excess of $500,000, which amount shall be for the account of
Parent and Sub (the "Deductible Amount").

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Parent Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to recover for, and the Threshold Amount and Deductible Amount shall
not apply to, any and all claims or payments made with respect to all Losses
(i) incurred pursuant to Sections 8.2(a)(ii) to 8.2(a)(xi), other than
8.2(a)(x), or (ii) resulting from any breach or inaccuracy of any of the
Special Representations and Warranties.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, with respect to any
indemnification claim brought under Section 6.20 hereof, the provisions of
such Section 6.20 shall govern and the provisions of this Article VIII shall
not apply to such claim.

(g) Nothing in this Article VIII shall limit the liability of the Company, the
Shareholders or the Participating Optionholders for any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement, any Related
Agreements or in any certificates or other instruments delivered pursuant to
this Agreement if the Transaction does not close as a result of the
termination of this Agreement by Parent as a result of such breach by the
Company, the Shareholders or the Participating Optionholders.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereto agree
and acknowledge that any Parent Indemnified Party may bring a claim for
indemnification for any Loss under this Article VIII notwithstanding the fact
that such Parent Indemnified Party had knowledge of the breach, event
or circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived any
condition to the Closing related thereto.

 



-84-  (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, where any claim for a
Loss is proposed to be made by Parent or Sub against the Shareholders and
Participating Optionholders under this Article VIII regarding any
representation or warranty made herein relating to the Subsidiary, (i) the
Parent and Sub shall have first exhausted their recourse against the escrow
fund created under the Subsidiary Agreement, if such recourse is available
under the terms of the Subsidiary Acquisition Agreement, and (ii) may
thereafter proceed with a claim for such Loss (or the balance thereof after
any recovery from the aforementioned escrow fund) against the Shareholders
and Participating Optionholders for such Loss or the balance thereof (if such
a claim is otherwise a valid claim hereunder), provided that the Parent and
Sub will thereupon be deemed to have subrogated their rights of action
against the former shareholders of the Subsidiary in respect of such claim in
favour of the Shareholders and Optionholders (as represented by the
Shareholder Representative).

 

8.4 _Parent Indemnification._

(a) Subject to Section 8.5, Parent agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Shareholder and their respective officers, directors, affiliates, employees,
agents and representatives, (the "Shareholder Indemnified Parties") against
all Losses incurred or sustained by such Shareholder Indemnified Parties ,
directly or indirectly, as a result of:



     | (i) | any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of
Parent or Sub contained in Article IV of this Agreement or the certificate to
be delivered pursuant to Section 7.3(c) ( _provided_ that, in the event of
any such breach or inaccuracy, for purposes of determining the amount of any
Loss, no effect will be given to any qualification as to "materiality" or
a "Parent Material Adverse Effect" contained therein), 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | any failure by Parent or Sub to perform or comply with any
covenant applicable to either of them contained in this Agreement, or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | any fraud or wilful or intentional misrepresentation of
Parent or Sub or any wilful breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
of Parent or Sub contained in this Agreement or the certificate to be
delivered pursuant to Section 7.3(c). 
---|---|--- 

Parent shall not have any right of contribution, indemnification or right of
advancement from any Shareholder with respect to any Loss claimed by such
Shareholder.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of the Shareholders to
pursue remedies under any Related Agreement against the parties thereto.

8.5  _Limitations on Parent Indemnification; Remedies_

(a) Except in the case of fraud or wilful or intentional misrepresentation
in respect of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement, the aggregate liability of Parent pursuant to Section 8.4 shall be
limited to an amount equal to the Escrow Amount. For the 

 



-85-   avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in this Section 8.5 shall not
apply to claims for indemnity pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section
8.4(a) hereof.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
except in the case of fraud or wilful or intentional misrepresentation in
respect of any representation, warranty or covenant or in the event of a
failure to pay any portion of the Total Share Consideration or any other
amount payable by Parent or Sub to the Shareholders and
Participating Optionholders hereunder when due, and except as set forth in
Section 8.5(c), a Shareholder may not recover any Losses incurred or sustained
by such Shareholder under Section 8.4(a)(i) hereof unless and until one or
more proven and completed Losses under Section 8.4(a)(i) hereof are in excess
of the Threshold Amount in the aggregate has or have been delivered to Parent,
in which case the Shareholder shall be entitled to recover all Losses incurred
or sustained by such Shareholder so identified in excess of the Deductible
Amount.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Shareholder shall be entitled to recover
for, and the Threshold Amount and Deductible Amount shall not apply to, any
and all claims or payments made with respect to all Losses incurred or
sustained by such Shareholder pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) of Section
8.4(a) hereof.

(d) Nothing in this Article VIII shall limit the liability of Parent or Sub
for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement, any Related Agreements or in any certificates or other instruments
delivered pursuant to this Agreement if the Transaction does not close as a
result of the termination of this Agreement by the Company or the Shareholder
Representative as a result of such breach by Parent or Sub.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereto agree
and acknowledge that any Shareholder may bring a claim for indemnification for
any Loss under this Article VIII incurred or sustained by such Shareholder
notwithstanding the fact that such Shareholder had knowledge of the breach,
event or circumstance giving rise to such Loss prior to the Closing or waived
any condition to the Closing related thereto.

8.6 _Third Party Claims; Direct Claims for Indemnification; Arbitration._

(a)  __ _Third Party Claim Indemnification Procedures_. __



     | (i) |

If any written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party may be
reasonably expected to have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder,
is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a
third party, including a Government Entity (a "Third Party Claim"), such
Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party (or the
Shareholder Representative, where the Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder or
a Participating Optionholder (each a "Shareholder Indemnifying Party") and
indemnification is not being sought hereunder directly from such
Shareholder Indemnifying Party) in writing of such Third Party Claim (a
"Third Party Claim Notice," collectively with Direct Claim Notices, 

---|---|--- 
 



-86-   "Claim Notices"); _provided, however_ , that the failure to give a timely
Third Party Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an Indemnified Party
hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a material prejudicial
effect on the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party
with respect to such Third Party Claim or the quantum of such Third Party
Claim (including all interest and other penalties which may accrue as a
result of such delay). A Third Party Claim Notice shall contain a brief
summary of the facts underlying or relating to such claim to the extent then
known by the Indemnified Party and a copy of any correspondence or notice
received from the relevant third party and a statement that the Indemnified
Party seeks indemnification for Losses relating to such Third Party Claim. 

---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | In the event of a Third Party Claim against an Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party, or, where the Indemnifying Party is a
Shareholder Indemnifying Party, the Shareholder Representative, shall be
entitled on behalf of the Shareholder Indemnifying Parties (or in the event
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from a Shareholder
Indemnifying Party, such Shareholder Indemnifying Party shall be entitled),
at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct, the
defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the right
in its sole discretion to conduct the defense of, and to settle, any such
Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that except with the consent of the
Indemnifying Parties, or, where the Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder
Indemnifying Party, the Shareholder Representative (or, in the event
indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from a Shareholder
Indemnifying Party, such Shareholder Indemnifying Party), no settlement of any
such Third Party Claim with third party claimants shall be determinative of
the amount of Losses relating to such matter. If there is a Third Party Claim
that, if adversely determined would give rise to a right of recovery for
Losses hereunder, then any amounts incurred or accrued by the Parent
Indemnified Party in defense of such Third Party Claim, regardless of the
outcome of such claim, shall be deemed Losses hereunder. In the event that
the Shareholder Representative (or, in the event indemnification is being
sought hereunder directly from a Shareholder Indemnifying Party, such
Shareholder Indemnifying Party) has consented to any such settlement, the
Shareholder Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to object
under any provision of this Article VIII to the amount of any Third Party
Claim by Parent against the Special Escrow Fund, the Escrow Fund, or against
the Shareholder Indemnifying Parties directly, as the case may be, with
respect to such settlement. 
---|---|--- 
 

(b) _Direct Claim Indemnification Procedures._



     | (i) |

If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim for indemnification hereunder
for Losses that do not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Claim"),
the Indemnified Party shall notify each Indemnifying Party from whom
indemnification is sought (or the Shareholder Representative, where the
Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder Indemnifying Party and indemnification is
not being sought hereunder directly from such 

---|---|--- 
 



-87-   Shareholder Indemnifying Party) in writing of such Direct Claim (a "Direct
Claim Notice"), including a brief summary of the facts underlying or related
to such claim to the extent then known by the Indemnified Party and a
statement that the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification for Losses relating
to such claim. The Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative,
where the Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder Indemnifying Party and
indemnification is not being sought hereunder directly from such Shareholder
Indemnifying Party) shall have a period of 30 days within which to investigate
and respond to such Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate with such investigation and response. 

---|--- 



     | (ii) | If the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder
Representative, where the Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder Indemnifying
Party and indemnification is not being sought hereunder directly from such
Shareholder Indemnifying Party) accepts a Direct Claim or does not respond
within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
accepted the Direct Claim and to have conclusively acknowledged
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to all Losses
imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted against the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party
(or the Shareholder Representative, where the Indemnifying Party is a
Shareholder Indemnifying Party and indemnification is not being sought
hereunder directly from such Shareholder Indemnifying Party) accepts or is
deemed to accept the Direct Claim within 30 days after the date of such
acceptance, it shall pay (or, where the Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder
Indemnifying Party, the Shareholder Representative shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to pay) the amount of Losses (if any) specified in the Direct
Claim Notice for which the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder
Representative, where the Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder Indemnifying
Party and indemnification is not being sought hereunder directly from such
Shareholder Indemnifying Party) has accepted indemnification at that time
(which amount shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such Direct
Claim). 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | A Claim Notice shall state the estimated amount of Losses
(which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of such claim)
that the Indemnified Party believes it has sustained, incurred or suffered or
reasonably anticipates to sustain, incur or suffer with respect to any Third
Party Claim or Direct Claim and identify the representations and warranties
contained herein that the Indemnified Party believes were breached or
otherwise identify the basis upon which the Indemnified Party believes that it
is entitled to indemnification (which basis shall not be conclusive of the
final determination of liability for indemnification).  
---|---|--- 

(c) _Resolution of Conflicts; Arbitration._

 



     | (i) |

In the event that the Indemnifying Party (or the Shareholder Representative,
where the Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder Indemnifying Party
and indemnification is not being sought hereunder directly from such
Shareholder Indemnifying Party) shall object to any 

---|---|--- 
 



-88-   claim or claims in respect of Losses made in any Direct Claim, within 30
days after delivery of such claim by delivery of a written objection notice
(an "Objection Notice"), the Indemnifying Party or, where the Indemnifying
Party is a Shareholder Indemnifying Party, the Shareholder Representative (or
such objecting Shareholder Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnified Party shall
attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims. If the Indemnifying Party, or, where the
Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder Indemnifying Party, the Shareholder
Representative (or such objecting Shareholder Indemnifying Party) and
the Indemnified Party should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of a
claim against the Special Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished
to the Escrow Agent.  

---|--- 



     | (ii) | If no such agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation and prior to 30 days after delivery of an Objection Notice, either
an Indemnifying Party or, where the Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder
Indemnifying Party, the Shareholder Representative (or the objecting
Shareholder Indemnifying Party) or an Indemnified Party may demand arbitration
of the matter unless the amount of the Loss that is at issue is the subject
of a pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall
not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to the parties. In
the event that, within 30 days after submission of any dispute to arbitration,
the Indemnifying Party or, where the Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder
Indemnifying Party, the Shareholder Representative (or the objecting
Shareholder Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnified Party cannot mutually
agree on one arbitrator, then, within 15 days after the end of such 30 day
period, the Indemnifying Party or, where the Indemnifying Party is a
Shareholder Indemnifying Party, the Shareholder Representative (or the
objecting Shareholder Indemnifying Party) and the Indemnified Party shall each
select one arbitrator. The two arbitrators so selected shall select a
third arbitrator. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) |

Any such arbitration shall be held in the state of Delaware, under the rules
then in effect of the American Arbitration Association. The
arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration
shall be paid, including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of
each arbitrator and the administrative fee of the American Arbitration
Association. The arbitrator or arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a
limited time period and establish procedures designed to reduce the cost and
time for discovery while allowing the parties an opportunity, adequate in the
sole judgment of the arbitrator or majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about
the subject matter of the dispute. The arbitrator, or a majority of the three
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall rule upon motions to compel or limit
discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the same extent as a competent court of law or
equity, should the arbitrators or a majority of the three arbitrators, as
the case may be, 

---|---|--- 
 



-89-   determine that discovery was sought without substantial justification or
that discovery was refused or objected to without substantial justification.
The decision of the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the
case may be, as to the validity and amount of any disputed claim in any Claim
Notice shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this
Agreement. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written
findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment,
decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on, and make distributions from the Special Escrow Fund or
the Escrow Fund, as the case may be, in accordance with, the terms of such
award, judgment, decree or order as applicable. Within 30 days of a decision
of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by one party to another, such party
shall make the payment to such other party, including any distributions out
of the Special Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund, as applicable. 

---|--- 



     | (iv) | Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Except as set forth in Section
8.6(c)(v) hereof, the forgoing arbitration provision shall apply to any
dispute among any Shareholders, Parent, any other Parent Indemnified Party,
the Shareholder Representative and any Shareholder Indemnifying Party under
this Article VIII hereof, whether relating to claims upon the Special Escrow
Fund or the Escrow Fund or to the other indemnification obligations set forth
in this Article VIII. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (v) | This Section 8.6(c) shall not apply to claims against the
Escrow Fund made in respect of the calculation of Excess Liabilities. Claims
against the Escrow Fund made in respect of any Excess Liabilities shall be
resolved pursuant to the procedures in Section 8.8 hereof. 
---|---|--- 

(d) _Adjustments to Losses._



     | (i) | Insurance. In calculating the amount of any Losses, the
proceeds actually received by an Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates
under any insurance policy relating to the Third Party Claim or the Direct
Claim, net of any actual costs, expenses or premium increases incurred in
connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds, shall be deducted from
such Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to be subrogated to any
rights of an Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified
Parties shall have no obligation to assert any rights or make any claim or
demand under any insurance policy relating to any Third Party Claim or Direct
Claim or any occurrence, claim or Losses that results in or would reasonably
be expected to result in a payment by or on behalf of an Indemnifying Party
under this Article VIII. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) |

Taxes. In calculating the amount of any Losses, any tax benefits which are
received by an Indemnified Party that are directly attributable to such
Losses (other than such tax benefits to the Company as are entitled to be
received by, and are remitted to, the Shareholders hereunder) shall be
deducted from such Losses _provided that_ the adjustment provided for in
this Section 8.6(d)(ii) shall only apply so long as the 

---|---|--- 
 



-90-   Company (and or the Sub if the Sub is the successor to the Company)
continues to file separate Canadian tax returns. 

---|--- 

(e) _Reimbursement._ If an Indemnified Party or any of its affiliates recovers
an amount from a third party in respect of Losses that are the subject of
indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Losses have been
paid by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party (or, if the Indemnifying
Party is a Shareholder or Participating Optionholder, and if the escrow is
still in effect, the Escrow Agent) the amount recovered from the third party,
up to a maximum amount equal to the amount paid by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Article VIII in respect of such Losses (or, if the
Indemnifying Party is a Shareholder or Participating Optionholder, any amount
paid by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement), less any actual
costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection
with securing or obtaining such amount from the third party.

8.7 _Shareholder Representative_

 

(a) By virtue of the approval of the Transaction and this Agreement by the
Shareholders and the Participating Optionholders, each of the Shareholders
and Participating Optionholders shall be deemed to have agreed to irrevocably
appoint Summerhill Venture Partners Inc. and its agent as its agent and
attorney-in-fact, as the Shareholder Representative for and on behalf of the
Shareholders and Participating Optionholders, to receive and distribute
payments, to give and receive notices and communications, to enter into any
agreement for and on behalf of the Shareholders and Participating
Optionholders contemplated under this Agreement, to authorize payment to any
Parent Indemnified Party from the Special Escrow Fund or the Escrow Fund in
satisfaction of claims by any Parent Indemnified Party, to object to such
payments, to make any claims for indemnification for Losses on behalf of any
Shareholder or Participating Optionholder, to agree to, negotiate, enter into
settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders
of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, to assert,
negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration
and comply with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to,
any claim by any Parent Indemnified Party against any Shareholder or
Participating Optionholder, by any such Shareholder or Participating
Optionholder against any Parent Indemnified Party, or by any Shareholder or
Participating Optionholder against Parent, or any dispute between any Parent
Indemnified Party and any Shareholder or Participating Optionholder, in each
case relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
to take all other actions that are either (i) necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of the Shareholder Representative for the accomplishment of the
foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms of this Agreement. Such
agency may be changed by the Shareholders or Participating Optionholders from
time to time upon not less than 30 days prior written notice to Parent; 
_provided, however_ , that the Shareholder Representative may not be removed
unless Shareholders and Participating Optionholders who together hold a two-
thirds interest of the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity
of the substituted agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a vacancy in the
position of Shareholder Representative may be filled by the holders of a
majority in interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the
Shareholder Representative, and the Shareholder Representative shall not

 



-91-   receive any compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or
from the Shareholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Shareholders.

 

(b) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Representative,
including an amendment, extension or waiver of this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.3 and Section 9.4 hereof, shall constitute a decision of the
Shareholders and Participating Optionholders and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Shareholders and Participating Optionholders, and
Parent and Sub may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Shareholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholders and Participating Optionholders. Each of
Parent and Sub is hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any
acts done by it in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction
of the Shareholder Representative.

(c) The Shareholder Representative may rely and act upon any statement, report
or opinion prepared by or any advice received from the auditors, counsel or
other professional advisors of the Shareholder Representative or the Company.
Absent fraud, gross negligence or wilful misconduct, the Shareholder
Representative shall not be responsible or held liable for any loss or damage
resulting from so relying or from acting in accordance with this Agreement as
the Shareholder Representative. Each Shareholder and Participating
Optionholder agrees (i) to jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless
the Shareholder Representative and its officers, directors and security
holders from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses
(including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses on a full indemnity
basis) and liabilities (collectively, such losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses and liabilities being the "Indemnified Liabilities") to which
Shareholder Representative may become subject, insofar as such Indemnified
Liabilities (or actions, suits, or proceedings, including any inquiry or
investigation or claim, in respect thereof) arise out of, in any way relate
to, or result from its acting as Shareholder Representative hereunder and (ii)
to reimburse the Shareholder Representative and its officers, directors and
security holders upon demand for all legal or other expenses, if any,
incurred in connection with its acting as Shareholder Representative, other
than in the case of fraud, gross negligence or wilful misconduct, provided
that the Shareholders Representative has acted in compliance with
this Agreement.

(d) Each Shareholder and Participating Optionholder hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably directs the Parent to deposit its Pro Rata Portion, as indicated
on the Spreadsheet, of the Expense Account in a trust account with LaBarge
Weinstein Professional Corporation to be held in trust for the benefit of the
Shareholders and the Participating Optionholders. The Expense Amount shall be
used by the Shareholder Representative in its discretion to fund expenses
incurred by Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Shareholders and
Participating Optionholders in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement.

8.8 _Adjustment to Consideration_

(a) Within 45 days following the Closing Date, Parent may, at its election,
cause to be prepared and delivered to the Shareholder Representative an
unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "Adjusted
Balance Sheet"). The Adjusted Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied on a basis consistent with the Financials. In
the event 

 



-92-   that, pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.8(a), it is determined that
the amount equal to (i) the absolute value of the Companys total current
assets (as defined by and as determined in accordance with GAAP but excluding
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) at the Closing Date as reflected on
the Adjusted Balance Sheet _minus_ (ii) the absolute value of the Companys
total current liabilities (as defined by and as determined in accordance with
GAAP but excluding deferred revenue) at the Closing Date as reflected on the
Adjusted Balance Sheet (collectively, the "Net Assets at Closing") _plus_
(iii) the Balance Sheet Adjustment Amount is a number less than the Balance
Sheet Target, then an amount equal to such difference ("Excess Liabilities")
shall be paid to Parent and shall not be limited by the Threshold Amount or
the Deductible Amount. Parent shall have the right to require that the Excess
Liabilities be paid to it from (x) the Escrow Fund or (y) the Shareholders and
Participating Optionholders based on their respective Pro Rata Portion. For
purposes of this calculation, Third Party Expenses shall not be considered as
part of total current liabilities. Following delivery by Parent to the
Shareholder Representative of the Adjusted Balance Sheet, Parent shall give
the Shareholder Representative reasonable access during Parents regular
California business hours to those books and records of the Company in the
possession or control of Parent and any personnel which relate to the
preparation of the Adjusted Balance Sheet for purposes of resolving
any disputes concerning the Adjusted Balance Sheet and the calculation of Net
Assets at Closing.

(b) The Shareholder Representative shall have 15 days following delivery of
the Adjusted Balance Sheet during which to notify Parent in writing (the
"Notice of Objection") of any good faith objections to the calculation of Net
Assets at Closing or the Adjusted Balance Sheet, as it affects such
calculation, setting forth a reasonably specific and detailed description of
its objections and the dollar amount of each objection. If the Shareholder
Representative objects to the Adjusted Balance Sheet or Parents calculation
of Net Assets at Closing as reflected thereon, Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall attempt to resolve any such objections within 15 days of
the receipt by Parent of the Notice of Objection.

 

(c) If Parent and the Shareholder Representative are unable to resolve any
such dispute within the 15 day period following receipt of the Notice
of Objection referred to in Section 8.8(b) hereof, Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall submit the dispute to a partner in the audit practice of
any nationally recognized accounting firm that is mutually agreeable to both
parties (the "Independent Accounting Firm"). Each of the parties to this
Agreement shall, and shall cause their respective affiliates and
representatives to, provide full cooperation to the Independent Accounting
Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall (i) act in its capacity as an
expert and not as an arbitrator, (ii) consider only those matters as to which
there is a dispute between the parties, (iii) not assign a value to any item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by any party or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by any party and (iv) be
instructed to reach its conclusions regarding any such dispute within 30 days
after its appointment and provide a written explanation of its decision. In
the event that Parent and the Shareholder Representative submit any dispute to
an Independent Accounting Firm, each such party may submit a "position paper"
to the Independent Accounting Firm setting forth the position of such party
with respect to such dispute, to be considered by such Independent Accounting
Firm as it deems appropriate. 50% of any expenses

 



-93-   relating to the engagement of the Independent Accounting Firm ("Independent
Accounting Firm Expenses") shall be paid by Parent and 50% of such expenses
shall be paid by the Shareholder Representative; _provided, however_ , that
in the event the Shareholder Representative fails to timely pay its 50% of the
Independent Accounting Firm Expenses, the parties agree that Parent may at its
option pay such 50% of the Independent Accounting Firm Expenses and recover
such amount from the Escrow Fund.

(d) If the Shareholder Representative does not deliver a Notice of Objection
in accordance with Section 8.8(b) hereof (i.e., within a 15 day period), the
Adjusted Balance Sheet (together with Parents calculation of Net Assets at
Closing reflected thereon), shall be deemed to have been accepted by all of
the parties to this Agreement. In the event that the Shareholder
Representative delivers a Notice of Objection in accordance with the
provisions above and Parent and the Shareholder Representative are able to
resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, the Adjusted Balance Sheet,
together with Parents calculation of Net Assets at Closing reflected thereon,
to the extent modified by mutual agreement of such parties, shall be deemed to
have been accepted by all of the parties to this Agreement. In the event that
the Shareholder Representative delivers a Notice of Objection in accordance
with the provisions set forth above and Parent and the Shareholder
Representative are unable to resolve such dispute by mutual agreement, the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on
the parties, and the Adjusted Balance Sheet, together with Parents
calculation of Net Assets at Closing reflected thereon, to the extent modified
by the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be deemed to have been accepted by
all of the parties to this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing provisions, the
calculation of Net Assets at Closing reflected on any such Adjusted Balance
Sheet shall be conclusive and binding on all of the parties to this Agreement
for purposes of this Section 8.8, no further adjustments shall be made thereto
and none of Parent, the Shareholder Representative or the Shareholders shall
have any further right to challenge such calculation of Net Assets at
Closing.

8.9 _Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments._ Any payments made to a
Parent Indemnified Party or a Shareholder pursuant to any indemnification
obligations under this Article VIII will be treated as adjustments to the
Adjusted Share Consideration for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment
will govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by law.

8.10 _One Recovery._ Any Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to double
recovery for any adjustments to consideration provided for hereunder or Losses
even though such Losses may have resulted from the breach of more than one of
the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants in this Agreement.

8.11 _Duty to Mitigate_. Nothing in this Agreement shall in any way restrict
or limit the general obligation at law of an Indemnified Party to mitigate
any Losses which it may suffer or incur by reason of the breach by an
Indemnifying Party of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant of
the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement.

 



-94-  8.12 _Punitive Damages._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Losses shall not
include any punitive damages.

8.13 _Exclusive Remedy._ Except in the case of a claim for fraud or willful
or intentional misrepresentation or where a Party is seeking injunctive or
other equitable relief in respect of a matter arising under this Agreement,
the remedies expressly provided in this Article VIII shall constitute the
sole and exclusive basis for and means of recourse of the Sub and the Parent,
on the one hand, and the Shareholders, on the other hand, and their respective
Indemnified Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

(e) by Parent if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this
Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation,

Sections 6.2 (Confidentiality), 6.3 (Public Disclosure) and 6.22
