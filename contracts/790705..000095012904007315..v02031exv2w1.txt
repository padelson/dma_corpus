67    iii    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
MERGER (the "Agreement") is entered into as September 14, 2004, by and among
TEKELEC, a California corporation ("Parent"), PUNKYDOO INC., a Delaware
corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Acquisition Subsidiary"),
VOCALDATA, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and CORE CAPITAL
PARTNERS, L.P., as Representative. Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary, the
Company and the Representative are referred to herein each as a "Party" and
together as the "Parties."   RECITALS   A. The respective Boards of
Directors of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary have approved the
merger (the "Merger") of Acquisition Subsidiary with and into the Company in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and determined
that the Merger is advisable and in the best interests of their respective
stockholders (with respect to each Party, its "Stockholders") and have
approved, adopted and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.   B. The Company, Acquisition Subsidiary, the
Representative and Parent desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with, and establish various conditions precedent
to, the Merger.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the recitals and the
mutual covenants, representations, warranties, conditions, and agreements
hereinafter expressed, the Parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE
MERGER   1.1 Merger and Effect of Merger.   (a) The constituent
corporations of the Merger are the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary.  
(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, and in accordance
with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), at
the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined), Acquisition Subsidiary shall be
merged into the Company and the separate corporate existence of Acquisition
Subsidiary thereupon shall cease. The Company shall be the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"), and the
separate corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by the
Merger.   (c) At and after the Effective Time (as hereinafter defined),
the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers
and franchises and be subject to all the restrictions, disabilities and
duties of both Acquisition Subsidiary and the Company, as provided more
particularly in the DGCL.     1.2 Method of Effecting Merger; Closing  
The Merger shall be effected as follows:   (a) Certificate of Merger. The
Company shall execute a Certificate of Merger in substantially the form set
forth in Exhibit A (the "Certificate of Merger") and shall cause the
Certificate of Merger to be filed and recorded on the Closing Date (as
hereinafter defined) with the Secretary of State of Delaware in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the Company\'s certificate of
incorporation shall be amended and restated effective as of the Effective
Time to be as set forth in the Certificate of Merger. The Merger shall
thereupon become effective and be consummated immediately upon such filing or
at such later time as may be mutually agreed by Parent, the Company and
Acquisition Subsidiary and specified in the Certificate of Merger
in accordance with the DGCL (the "Effective Time").   (b) Closing. The
closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Bryan Cave LLP, Santa Monica, California, at 9:00 a.m., local time, on
September 21, 2004, or, subject to Section 9.1, on the second Business Day
after the day on which the last condition to Closing has been met or waived
as contemplated in Article VII, or on such other date as Parent, the Company
and Acquisition Subsidiary may agree in writing (the "Closing
Date"). "Business Day" shall mean any day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or
a legal holiday in the State of California, United States of America.   1.3
Acquisition Subsidiary Capital Stock.   At the Effective Time, each of the
issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share,
of Acquisition Subsidiary shall be converted into one share of the Common
Stock of the Surviving Corporation and upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares of Common Stock of Acquisition Subsidiary, the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly issue the owner thereof a certificate
representing the shares of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation into
which it has been converted. After the Effective Time such shares shall be
the only issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
and shall be owned by Parent.   1.4 Merger Consideration.   (a) Aggregate
Merger Consideration. Subject to the other terms and provisions of this
Agreement, including without limitation Section 1.5, Section 1.9 and Section
10.7 and any applicable backup or other withholding requirements, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder thereof, the shares of the Company\'s Series A Preferred Stock,
par value $.005 per share, the shares of the Company\'s Series B Preferred
Stock, par value $.005 per share, the shares of the Company\'s Series
C Preferred Stock, par value $.005 per share, and the shares of the
Company\'s Series C-1 Preferred Stock, par value $.005 per share
(collectively, the "Company Preferred Stock") shall be converted into and
become the right to receive consideration (the "Merger Consideration")
comprised of, in the aggregate, (i) the cash amount of $14,500,000 (the "Cash
Merger Consideration") reduced by the amount, if any, by which the Company
Acquisition Expenses exceed the aggregate amount of $750,000 as provided in
Section 10.7 (the "Initial Cash   2   Consideration") and (ii) that
number of shares of Common Stock of Parent, without par value ("Parent Common
Stock"), that results from dividing $14,500,000 reduced by the Working
Capital Adjustment (pursuant to Section 1.5), if any, by the average per
share closing sales price (the "Average Closing Stock Price") of Parent
Common Stock, as quoted on the Nasdaq National Market (and as reported by The
Wall Street Journal) for the ten trading days ending on the second trading
day preceding the Closing Date, as rounded up or down to the nearest whole
share (the "Stock Merger Consideration").   (b) Conversion of Shares.
Subject to the other terms and provisions of this Agreement, including
without limitation Sections 1.5, 1.9 and 10.7 and any applicable backup or
other withholding requirements, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder thereof:   (i) Each
of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company\'s  Series A Preferred
Stock, par value of $.005 per share (the "Series A  Preferred Stock"), will
be converted into and become the right to receive  a portion of the Stock
Merger Consideration consisting of: (i) the number  of shares of Parent
Common Stock that is equal to the Series A Exchange  Ratio and (ii) an amount
of cash that is equal to the Series A Cash  Amount;   (ii) Each of the
issued and outstanding shares of the  Company\'s Series B Preferred Stock,
par value of $.005 per share (the  "Series B Preferred Stock"), will be
converted into and become the right  to receive a portion of the Stock Merger
Consideration consisting of: (i)  the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
that is equal to the Series B  Exchange Ratio and (ii) an amount of cash that
is equal to the Series B  Cash Amount;   (iii) Each of the issued and
outstanding shares of the  Company\'s Series C Preferred Stock, par value of
$.005 per share (the  "Series C Preferred Stock"), will be converted into and
become the right  to receive a portion of the Stock Merger Consideration
consisting of: (i)  the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal
to the Series C  Exchange Ratio and (ii) an amount of cash that is equal to
the Series C  Cash Amount; and   (iv) Each of the issued and outstanding
shares of the  Company\'s Series C-1 Preferred Stock, par value of $.005 per
share (the  "Series C-1 Preferred Stock," and together with the Series A
Preferred  Stock, Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock,
the  "Company Preferred Stock"), will be converted into and become the right
to  receive a portion of the Stock Merger Consideration consisting of: (i)
the  number of shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to the Series
C-1  Exchange Ratio and (ii) an amount of cash that is equal to the Series
C-1  Cash Amount.   (c) Certain Definitions. The following terms have the
following  meanings:   (i) "Series A Exchange Ratio" means the ratio of one
(1) to  the number set forth on Schedule 1.4 in the column entitled
"Exchange  Ratio" opposite the line entitled "Series A Preferred".  
3    (ii) "Series A Cash Amount" means the amount set forth on  Schedule
1.4 in the column entitled "Cash Amount" opposite the line  entitled "Series
A Preferred".   (iii) "Series B Exchange Ratio" means the ratio of one (1)
to  the number set forth on Schedule 1.4 in the column entitled "Exchange 
Ratio" opposite the line entitled "Series B Preferred".   (iv) "Series B
Cash Amount" means the amount set forth on  Schedule 1.4 in the column
entitled "Cash Amount" opposite the line  entitled "Series B Preferred".  
(v) "Series C Exchange Ratio" means, with respect to each  holder of shares
of Series C Preferred Stock, the ratio of one (1) to the  number set forth on
Schedule 1.4 in the column entitled "Exchange Ratio"  opposite the line
containing such stockholder\'s name under the title  "Series C
Stockholders".   (vi) "Series C Cash Amount" means, with respect to each
holder  of shares of Series C Preferred Stock, the amount set forth on
Schedule  1.4 in the column entitled "Cash Amount" opposite the line
containing such  stockholder\'s name under the title "Series C
Stockholders".   (vii) "Series C-1 Exchange Ratio" means, with respect to
each  holder of shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock, the ratio of one (1)
to  the number set forth on Schedule 1.4 in the column entitled "Exchange 
Ratio" opposite the line containing such stockholder\'s name under the  title
"Series C-1 Stockholders".   (viii) "Series C-1 Cash Amount" means, with
respect to each  holder of shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock, the amount
set forth on  Schedule 1.4 in the column entitled "Cash Amount" opposite the
line  containing such stockholder\'s name under the title "Series C-1 
Stockholders".   (ix) "Exchange Ratios" means, collectively, the Series A 
Exchange Ratio, the Series B Exchange Ratio, the Series C Exchange Ratio, 
and the Series C-1 Exchange Ratio.   (x) "Cash Amounts" means, collectively,
the Series A Cash  Amount, the Series B Cash Amount, the Series C Cash
Amount, and the Series  C-1 Cash Amount.   (xi) "Schedule 1.4" means a
schedule delivered by the Company  prior to Closing reflecting the Exchange
Ratios and the Cash Amounts in  accordance with the Company\'s Second Amended
and Restated Certificate of  Incorporation, which schedule shall be prepared
in accordance with the  spreadsheet previously delivered to Parent by the
Company.   (d) No Consideration for Common Stock. The holders of the
Company\'s Common Stock, par value $.00125 per share (the "Company Common
Stock") shall be entitled to no consideration in the Merger.   4    (e)
Initial Stock Merger Consideration. The portion of the Stock Merger
Consideration issuable to the Stockholders at Closing (the "Initial
Stock Consideration") shall be equal to the Stock Consideration less that
number of shares of Parent Common Stock that results from dividing $5,800,000
by the Average Closing Stock Price (the "Escrow Deposit"), which shall be
withheld and delivered to U.S. Bank National Association (the "Escrow Agent")
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement on the Closing Date.   (f) No Fractional
Shares. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Company Shares
who would otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
to be received by such holder at that time) will receive from Parent an
amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the Average
Closing Stock Price multiplied by the fraction of a share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled. The
parties acknowledge that any payment of cash consideration in lieu of issuing
fractional shares provided for herein was not separately bargained for
consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes
of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise
be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.   (g) Stockholder Rights
upon Merger. At the Effective Time, holders of shares of issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company ("Company Shares") shall cease to
be, and shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company and certificates
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company
Shares (the "Certificates") shall cease to represent any rights with respect
thereto and, subject to applicable Law (as hereinafter defined) and this
Agreement, the Certificates shall only represent the right of the Preferred
Stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration provided in this Section
1.4. All consideration delivered upon surrender of shares of Company
Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been delivered in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Company
Shares. The Company Shares held in the treasury of the Company, if any, shall
be canceled as of the Effective Time, and no Merger Consideration shall
be payable with respect thereto. After the date hereof, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of Company Shares that
are outstanding on the date hereof.   (h) Letter of Transmittal. As
promptly as practicable on or after the Effective Time, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall send to each Preferred Stockholder who is a
record holder of Certificates (each, a "Record Holder") immediately prior to
the Effective Time, (i) a letter of transmittal substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii)
instructions for use in surrendering the Certificates in exchange for the
applicable Initial Merger Consideration for such Company Shares. At the
Effective Time or at any time thereafter, upon surrender of a Certificate to
Parent or Surviving Corporation, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal, the holder shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor as
promptly as practicable thereafter, the Initial Merger Consideration as
provided in this Article I in respect of the Company Shares represented
by the Certificate (after giving effect to any required withholding Tax).
If payment of the Initial Merger Consideration in respect of the Company
Shares is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name a
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such
payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that   5   the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder
of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction
of Parent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not payable. Any
Initial Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which
is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to,
or become property of any Government entity shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Neither the
Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.   (i) Withholding. Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the Preferred Stockholders\' Merger Consideration otherwise payable to any
Preferred Stockholder hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement any amounts
that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person.   (j)
Exchange Adjustments. The Cash Amounts and the Exchange Ratios shall be
subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of a stock split,
stock dividend, recapitalization or other change in the terms applicable to
Parent Common Stock or to Company Shares which occurs on or after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.   1.5 Net Working Capital
Adjustment to Merger Consideration.   (a) Benchmark Working Capital
Statement. "Benchmark Working Capital" means $2,200,000. As used herein, "Net
Working Capital" means, as of the specified date, the current assets of the
Company less the current liabilities of the Company (excluding all Company
Acquisition Expenses in the case of Net Working Capital as of the Closing
Date and excluding all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities), all
as determined and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently applied with the Company\'s Financial Statements (as
hereinafter defined) (including the same accounting principles, practices,
valuation and estimation methodologies used by the Company in the preparation
of the Financial Statements).   (b) Estimated Working Capital Statement. At
least three (3) business days prior to the Closing, the Company shall prepare
and deliver to Parent a good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital (the
"Estimated Statement of Working Capital"), together with an estimated balance
sheet of the Company as of the Closing (the "Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet"), prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied
with the Company\'s Financial Statements (including the same accounting
principles, practices, valuation and estimation methodologies used by the
Company in the preparation of the Financial Statements). The Estimated
Statement of Working Capital shall be calculated based on the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet.   6    (c) Final Working Capital Statement. Within
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall in good faith prepare
and deliver to the Representative an unaudited balance sheet of the Company
at and as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") which shall be
accompanied by a statement of Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date as
reflected on such balance sheet, each of which shall be prepared and
presented in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied with the Company\'s
Financial Statements (including the same accounting principles, practices,
valuation and estimation methodologies used by the Company in the preparation
of the Financial Statements) (the "Statement of Working Capital").   (d)
Disputes Concerning Statement of Working Capital. During the thirty (30) days
immediately following the receipt of the Statement of Working Capital by the
Representative, the Representative and their accountants shall, at the
Representative\'s expense, be entitled to review the Statement of
Working Capital and any working papers, trial balances and similar materials
("Working Papers") relating to the Statement of Working Capital prepared by
Parent. The Statement of Working Capital shall become final and binding upon
the parties on the thirty-first (31st) day following delivery thereof (the
"Notice Period") unless the Representative gives written notice to Parent of
its disagreement with the Statement of Working Capital (a "Notice of
Disagreement") prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify
in reasonable detail the nature of any disagreement so asserted. If a timely
Notice of Disagreement is delivered by the Representative, then the Statement
of Working Capital (as revised, if at all, in accordance with this Section
1.5(c)) shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the earlier of (i)
the date the parties hereto resolve in writing all differences they have with
respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (ii) the
date all matters in dispute are finally resolved by the Independent
Accounting Firm (as hereinafter defined). During the thirty (30) days
immediately following the delivery of any Notice of Disagreement, Parent and
the Representative shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing
any differences which they may have with respect to any matters specified in
such Notice of Disagreement. During such period, Parent and the
Representative shall have access to the other\'s Working Papers prepared in
connection with such party\'s preparation of the Statement of Working Capital
and the Notice of Disagreement, as the case may be. At the end of such thirty
(30) day period and if all differences have not been resolved, Parent and the
Representative shall submit to Ernst and Young LLP (the "Independent Accounting
Firm") for review and resolution of any and all matters which remain in
dispute and which are included in the Notice of Disagreement. The Independent
Accounting Firm shall reach a final resolution of all matters and shall
furnish such resolution in writing to Parent and the Representative as soon
as practicable after such matters have been referred to the Independent
Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm shall use the same
accounting principles (including all practices and valuation and estimation
methodologies) used by the Company in the preparation of the Financial
Statements, provided such principles are in accordance with the requirements
of Section 1.5(a). Such resolution shall be made in accordance with this
Agreement and will be conclusive and binding upon Parent and
the Representative. The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm
shall be allocated to be paid by Parent and/or the Representative based upon
the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party, as determined by
the Independent Accounting Firm.   (e) Final Working Capital. "Final
Working Capital" shall mean the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Date as
finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.5   7   either upon
agreement by the parties, by expiration of the Notice Period without delivery
of a Notice of Disagreement or by resolution of a dispute in accordance with
Section 1.5(c). Upon such final determination, the Stock Merger Consideration
will be reduced by the amount, if any, by which Benchmark Working Capital
exceeds Final Working Capital (the amount of any such adjustment is referred
to herein as the "Working Capital Adjustment") with the value of the Parent
Common Stock being determined on the basis of the Average Closing
Stock Price. Upon such final determination, if the Benchmark Working Capital
exceeds the Final Working Capital, then Parent shall be entitled to satisfy
the amount of such difference from the Escrow Funds (as hereinafter defined)
and the Representative agrees to take all actions required to cause the
Escrow Agent to release such funds from the Escrow Funds.   1.6 Options and
Warrants.   (a) Company Warrants. At or before the Effective Time,
each then-outstanding unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock ("Company Warrant") shall, as a
condition to the consummation of the Merger, be terminated without any
payment by the Company to the holder in respect thereof being required.  
(b) Company Options. At the Effective Time, each then outstanding un-
exercised option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock

Appointment of Stockholders\' Representative.   (a) By voting in favor of
the Merger or participating in the conversion of Company Preferred Stock,
each of the holders of Company Preferred Stock (the "Preferred Stockholders")
hereby appoints Core Capital Partners, L.P. as its representative (the
"Representative"), to be its true and lawful attorney-in-fact for all matters
in connection with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (the "Subject
Documents"), including without limitation the acceptance of any claim by
Parent and the compromise of any disputes between Parent and any Preferred
Stockholders relating to any Subject Document. The Representative will act on
behalf of the Preferred Stockholders with respect to all matters requiring
action by the Preferred Stockholders under the Subject Documents. The
Representative hereby accepts such appointment. The Representative shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the Preferred Stockholders on a several, but
not joint and several, basis of all reasonable expenses incurred in the
performance of its duties as Representative under the Subject Documents,
including, but not limited to, the right to employ financial and legal
advisors and other agents to undertake or to assist in the
assessment, litigation and/or settlement of any such claims; provided,
however, that Parent shall not have any obligation or liability for such
expenses or for payment of any fees of the Representative. The Representative
is expressly authorized to rely upon the advice of such consultants and
agents. By giving notice to the Representative in the manner provided by
Section 10.1, Parent shall be deemed to have given notice to all of the
Preferred Stockholders, and any action taken by the Representative may be
considered by Parent to be the action of the Representative and each
Preferred Stockholder for whom such action was taken for all purposes of any
Subject Document. In the event that the Representative is unable or refuses
to serve, the Preferred Stockholders that are or were, in the aggregate,
recipients of a majority of the Merger Consideration (the
"Majority Recipients") shall notify Parent in writing of the designation of a
successor to act as a Representative hereunder. The Majority Recipients can
replace the Representative at any time or from time to time, provided such
replacement Representative has prior thereto agreed to be bound by the terms
hereof and the Escrow Agreement in a writing acceptable to Parent in its sole
and absolute discretion.   10    (b) The Representative appointed
hereunder may take any action contemplated by the Subject Documents.   (c)
In the event that a Parent Indemnified Person gives notice to the
Representative appointed hereunder of a claim for which indemnification
may be sought, the Representative shall have the authority to determine, in
its judgment, whether to retain counsel (and to select that counsel) to
protect the Preferred Stockholders\' interests, whether to assume the defense
of or otherwise to control the handling of the claim, whether to consent to
indemnification and to make all other decisions required to be made by the
Preferred Stockholders pursuant to the Subject Documents, including without
limitation whether to consent or withhold consent to any settlement or
compromise of a claim.   (d) The Representative appointed hereunder shall
not be liable to any Preferred Stockholder for any act or omission taken
pursuant to or in conjunction with the Subject Documents, except for its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Preferred Stockholders shall,
severally and not jointly and severally, indemnify and hold the
Representative, and each successor thereof, harmless from any and all
liability and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys\' fees)
which may arise out of any action taken or omitted by it as a Representative
in accordance with the Subject Documents, as the same may be amended,
modified or supplemented, except such liability and expense as may result
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Representative.  
(e) The Representative appointed hereunder shall provide the Preferred
Stockholders with notice of any material actions taken by the Representative
in connection with their duties under the Subject Documents, but failure of
the Representative to do so shall not affect such Representative\'s authority
in any respect or result in any liability for the Representative.   ARTICLE

The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent if any of the following occur
after the date of this Agreement: (i) any written notice of, or other express
communication relating to, a default or event, occurrence, fact, condition,
change, development or effect ("Event") which, with notice or lapse of time
or both, would become a default under any Contract listed on Schedule 2.12;
(ii) receipt of any written notice or other express communication from
any third party alleging that the consent, approval, waiver or authorization
of, notice to or declaration or filing with, such third party is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(iii) receipt of any material written notice or other express communication
from any Government authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) the occurrence of an event which would
have   41   a Company Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse
Change; (v) the commencement or threat of any Action involving or affecting
the Company, or any of its property or assets which, if pending on the date
hereof, would have been required to have been disclosed in or pursuant to
this Agreement or which relates to the consummation of the Merger or any
material development in connection with any Action disclosed by the Company
in or pursuant to this Agreement; (vi) the occurrence of any Event after the
date hereof that would cause a breach by the Company of any provision of this
Agreement, including such a breach that would occur if such Event had taken
place on or prior to the date of this Agreement and (vii) the discovery by
the Company that any of its representations and warranties contained herein
were inaccurate in any respect on the date hereof. "Company Material Adverse
Change" and "Company Material Adverse Effect" mean, respectively, any change
or effect that is or could reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to
the business, operations, assets, liabilities, employee relationships,
earnings or results of operations, or the business condition (financial or
otherwise), of the Company, taken as a whole, but any circumstance, effect,
event or fact shall not be deemed (individually or in the aggregate) to
constitute, nor shall any of the foregoing be taken into account in
determining whether there has been or may be, a Company Material Adverse
Change or Company Material Adverse Effect, to the extent that such change,
circumstance, effect, event or fact results from (A) a general deterioration
in the economy or in the economic conditions prevalent in the industry in
which the Company operates; (B) matters that generally affect the industry in
which the Company operates; (C) the disclosure of the fact that Parent is the
prospective acquirer of the Company; (D) the announcement or pendency of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (E) actions taken by Parent or
any of its affiliates; or (F) compliance with the terms of, or the taking of
any action required by, this Agreement.   (b) In addition to, and not in
lieu of, the foregoing, the Company shall deliver to Parent no later than the
end of the second Business Day prior to the Closing Date a true and complete
schedule of changes (the "Update Schedule") to any of the information
contained in the Company\'s schedules to this Agreement (including changes to
any other representations or warranties of the Company in Article II hereof
as to which no schedules have been created as of the date hereof but as to
which a schedule would have been required hereunder to have been created on
or before the date hereof if such changes had existed on the date hereof),
which changes are required as a result of events or circumstances occurring
subsequent to the date hereof (it being understood that the mere discovery of
events or circumstances following the date hereof shall not constitute a
basis for any such change to the extent that the event occurred or the
circumstance existed prior to the date hereof) which would render
any representation or warranty inaccurate or incomplete at any time after the
date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, which Update Schedule shall be
dated as of the Closing Date (and for avoidance of doubt may be updated by
the Company in writing to reflect any additional changes which occur between
the date of initial delivery of the Update Schedule through the Closing Date,
subject to Parent having a reasonable period of time thereafter in which to
review such changes not to exceed two (2) Business Days). No such
supplemental information shall be deemed to avoid or cure any
misrepresentation or breach of warranty or constitute an amendment of any
representation, warranty or statement in this Agreement or negate any
indemnity hereunder; provided that if such supplemental information relates
to an event or circumstance occurring subsequent to the date hereof (other
than events or circumstances which arise from violation of Section 3.2) and
if Parent would have the right to not consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a result of the failure of the
condition contained in Section 7.3(b) on the basis of the  
42   information so disclosed and it does not exercise such right prior to
the Closing, then such supplemental information shall constitute an amendment
of the representation, warranty or statement to which it relates for purposes
of Article IX of this Agreement. For avoidance of doubt, any additions or
changes appearing on the Update Schedule which are identified by the Company
as a Company Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Change shall
be identified as such in the certificate to be delivered to Parent pursuant
to Section 7.3(b) and any changes or effects which are not so identified by
Company as a Company Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse
Change in Company\'s certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.3(b) shall
not be subject to the foregoing limitation and shall be subject to the
indemnification provisions of Article VIII unless and only to the extent that
Parent has, at the request of the Company pursuant to Section 4.2, expressly
consented to the action giving rise to such changes or effects.   4.4
Access to Information. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject
to the Non-Disclosure Agreement dated May 1, 2004, between Parent and the

the Company shall afford to Parent and to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of Parent,

Effective Time to the Company\'s properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records and, during such period, the Company shall furnish
promptly to Parent all other information concerning the Company\'s business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided that no
investigation pursuant to this Section 4.4 shall affect or modify any
representation or warranty given by the Company. Parent agrees that it shall
coordinate its contacts with the Company\'s personnel (other than the Senior
Management) with a member of Senior Management, but in any event such
personnel shall be made available for such contacts at reasonable times as
requested by Parent prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall hold, and shall
cause its respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic
information in accordance with the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement.

Disclosure Agreement, Parent (and any employee, representative or other agent
of Parent) may disclose to any and all parties, without limitation of any
kind, the Tax treatment and Tax structure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other Tax
analyses) that are provided to it relating to such Tax treatment and Tax
structure. However, any such information relating to the Tax treatment or Tax
structure is required to be kept confidential to the extent necessary to
comply with any applicable federal or state securities Laws.   4.5 Diligent

in this Agreement, the Company agrees to use diligent efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist

Stockholders in accordance with the DGCL, the Company\'s Restated Certificate

Company shall, and shall direct and use its diligent efforts to cause its
officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any parties that may be ongoing
with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
not authorize or permit any of its officers, directors or employees or
any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or
other representative retained by it to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,

the Company may engage in discussions or negotiations with, and furnish
information concerning the Company and its businesses, properties and assets
to, any Person which makes a Company Acquisition Proposal if, and only if,

obligations under Section 4.6, (B) such Company Acquisition Proposal

records (written and computer) relating to the Surviving Corporation or its
business or operations for any and all periods prior to and including the
Closing Date that it may require with respect to any reasonable business
purpose (including, without limitation, any Tax matter) or in connection with
any claim, dispute, action, cause of action, investigation or proceeding of
any kind by or against any Person, and shall (and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation) to cooperate fully with the Representative and its
representatives (including, without limitation, counsel and independent
auditors) in connection with the foregoing, as applicable, including, without
limitation, by making tax, accounting and financial personnel and other
appropriate employees and officers of the Surviving Corporation available to
the Representative and its representatives (including, without limitation,
counsel and independent auditors) with regard to any reasonable business
purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Representative shall not have
access to personnel records of the Surviving Corporation relating
to individual performance or evaluation records, medical histories or
other information that in Parent\'s good faith opinion is sensitive or the
disclosure of which could subject the Surviving Corporation to risk of
liability; provided that the Representative shall not be prohibited from
accessing such information pursuant to a valid court order.   ARTICLE VI 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES   6.1 Public Announcements. Within a
reasonable time following execution of this Agreement, Parent and the Company
shall issue a press release approved by both parties announcing the Merger.
Thereafter, the Parties hereto will not make any public disclosure of the  
49   terms hereof or issue any press release with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise issue any written
public statements with respect to such transactions without the prior written
consent of the Company, Parent, and Acquisition Subsidiary, not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, except as may be required by
applicable requirements of Laws or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or quotation system. Nothing
herein shall be interpreted to limit the Company\'s ability to communicate
with its Stockholders or holders of Company Stock Rights or other securities,
or its lenders, as may be necessary in order to consummate the Merger;
provided that the Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any such
written communication and with a summary of any material oral
communication.   6.2 Private Placement. Parent shall issue the Parent Common
Stock issued in the Merger in a private placement pursuant to an exemption
from registration under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation
D promulgated under the Securities Act unless it determines in its good faith
judgment after consultation with its legal counsel that such exemptions are
not available. Parent may prepare, with the cooperation of the Company, an
information statement to effect such private placement (the "Information
Statement"). The Company and the Parent shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause any such Information Statement to comply with the
requirements of the federal and state securities laws. Any such Information
Statement shall be, at the request of the Parent, supplied to the
Stockholders of the Company promptly. Each of the Parent and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any information included
in any Information Statement to not, at the time such Information Statement
is delivered to Stockholders of the Company, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. The Company shall not
include in the Information Statement any information with respect to
Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary the form and content of which has not been
approved by Parent prior to such inclusion. The Company shall not solicit the
vote of Shareholders in connection with the Merger by means of any general
advertising or general solicitation or otherwise in violation of any
applicable federal or state securities laws.   6.3 Restrictive Legends. The
Parent Common Stock may not be re-offered or resold other than in conformity
with the registration and/or qualification requirements of the Securities Act
and other applicable state blue sky securities laws and regulations or
pursuant to an exemption therefrom. The certificates issued by Parent with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock issued hereunder shall be
legended as necessary to comply with applicable federal and state securities
laws.   6.4 Certain Tax Matters.   (a) All transfer, documentary, sales,
use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and all conveyance fees,
recording charges and other fess and charges (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid one-half by Parent and one-half
by the Preferred Stockholders when due, and Parent will, at its own expense,
file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all
such Taxes, fees and charges, and if required cause its affiliates to, join
in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation. The
Parties   50   shall use diligent efforts and shall cooperate with each
other to minimize the amount of any such Taxes.   (b) Parent shall prepare
or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be filed, all Tax Returns of
the Company for any Taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing
Date that are filed after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed in prior years with
respect to similar Tax Returns except for changes required by applicable Law.
To the extent that such Tax Returns reflect a liability payable out of
Escrowed Funds, Parent shall permit the Representative at least 15 days prior
to filing to review and comment on all such Tax Returns; provided
however, such review and comment shall not prevent Parent from filing such
Tax Returns and Parent, in its reasonable discretion, shall not be obligated
to make any such requested changes. Except as provided in Section 6.4(d), all
Taxes payable with respect to these Tax Returns shall be borne by the
Preferred Stockholders (solely out of the Escrowed Funds) except to the
extent such Taxes relate to transactions or events occurring on the Closing
Date but after the Effective Time not in the Ordinary Course of Business.  
(c) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared, and file or cause to be
filed, all Tax Returns of the Company commencing prior to the Closing
Date and ending after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"). Such Tax
Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with practices followed in
prior years with respect to similar Tax Returns except for changes required
by applicable Law. To the extent that such Tax Returns reflect a liability
payable out of Escrowed Funds, Parent shall permit the Representative at
least 15 days prior to filing to review and comment on all such Tax Returns;
provided however, such review and comment shall not prevent Parent from
filing such Tax Returns and Parent, in its reasonable discretion, shall not
be obligated to make any such requested changes. Except as provided in
Section 6.4(d), the Preferred Stockholders shall pay (solely from the
Escrowed Funds) to the Company within fifteen (15) days after the date on
which Taxes are paid with respect to such Straddle Periods an amount equal to
the portion of such Taxes that relates to the Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date. For the purposes of this Section 6.4, in the case of any Taxes
that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period,
the portion of such Tax that relates to the portion of such Taxable period
ending on the Closing Date shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other
than Taxes imposed upon or related to income or receipts, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable period ending on
the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of days in the
entire taxable period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related
to income or receipts, be deemed to be equal to the amount that would be
payable if the relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Any credits
relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the
relevant Taxable period ended on the Closing Date (excluding for this purpose
any income or receipts resulting from any transaction or event occurring on
the Closing Date but after the Effective Time not in the Ordinary Course of
Business). All determinations necessary to give effect to the allocations
described in this Section 6.4 shall be made in a manner consistent with the
prior practice of the Company, except for changes required by Law or
fact.   (d) Notwithstanding Section 6.4(b) and Section 6.4(c), the
Preferred Stockholders shall not be liable for the payment of any Taxes of
the Company pursuant to such   51   Sections unless, and then only to
the extent that, the aggregate amount of all such Taxes exceed the sum of (i)
the amount of Taxes set forth as a liability on the Statement of Working
Capital as finalized in accordance with Section 1.5, plus (ii) the amount of
any refunds or credits of Taxes paid by the Company that relate to taxable
periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are
received or utilized by the Company, Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary after
the Closing Date, which refunds or credits are not reflected on the Statement
of Working Capital.   (e) Parent and the Representative agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practical,
such information (including reasonable access to books and records, Tax
Returns and Tax filings) and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the
filing of any Tax Return, the conduct of any Tax audit, and for the
prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding relating to any Tax
matter. Parent and the Representative shall cooperate with each other in the
conduct of any Tax audit or other Tax proceedings and each shall execute and
deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry
out the intent of this Section 6.4. Any Tax audit or proceeding of the
Company for periods ending on or before or including the Closing Date shall
be deemed a Parent Third Person Claim under Section 8.6.   ARTICLE VII

Indemnified Persons"), from and against and in respect of any and all loss,

ending after the Closing Date arising out of the settlement or  other
resolution (without the written consent of Parent) of a proposed Tax 
adjustment that relates to a Taxable period ending on or before the  Closing
Date;   (b) No information or knowledge acquired, or
investigations conducted, by Parent or its representatives (whether conducted
or acquired prior to the date hereof or between   56   the date hereof
and the Closing Date) of the Company or otherwise shall in any way limit, or
constitute a waiver of, or a defense to, any right of Parent or any Parent
Indemnified Person to assert a claim for indemnification under this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement.   8.2 Indemnification of Preferred
Stockholders.   (a) Pursuant to this Agreement, Parent will indemnify and
hold the Company and the Preferred Stockholders, and the directors, officers,
successors, assigns and agents of each of them (collectively, the
"Stockholder Indemnified Persons"), from and against and in respect of any
and all Indemnified Losses incurred or to be incurred by any of them
resulting from, arising out of, or directly or indirectly connected or
related to any breach or violation of Parent\'s representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements or (from and after the Effective Time) the Surviving
Corporation\'s post-closing covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto, except that Indemnified
Losses arising as a result of a breach prior to the Effective Time by the
Company shall not be covered by this indemnity.   (b) The Stockholder
Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification for Indemnified
Losses under Section 8.2(a) for breaches of the representations and
warranties made in Article III until Indemnified Losses exceed $290,000 in
the aggregate (at which point the Parent will be obligated to indemnify the
Stockholder Indemnified Persons from and against all Indemnified Losses
relating back to the first dollar); provided, that the foregoing limitation
shall not apply to claims or obligations arising under (i) Section 1.4 for
failure of Parent to pay the Merger Consideration, or (ii) Section 5.7.  
(c) The Stockholder Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled
to indemnification for Indemnified Losses under this Section 8.2 to the
extent such Indemnified Losses exceed $5,800,000 in the aggregate; provided,
that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to claims or obligations
arising under (i) Section 1.4 for failure of Parent to pay the Merger
Consideration, or (ii) Section 5.7.   8.3 Survival. Neither the Preferred
Stockholders on the one hand nor Parent on the other shall be liable for any
Indemnified Losses unless a written claim for indemnification under this
Agreement is delivered to such Person with respect thereto prior to 11:59
p.m. Central Time on the fifteen month anniversary of the Closing Date, or,
in the case of fraudulent misrepresentations, fraudulent warranties, willful
breaches of representations or warranties or fraudulent or willful breaches
of covenants and agreements by the Company, the eighteen month anniversary of
the Closing Date. The respective representations and warranties made in
Articles II and III and the covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing Date for a period of fifteen months, except that in the
case of fraudulent misrepresentations or warranties or fraudulent or willful
breaches of covenants and agreements, they shall survive the Closing Date for
a period of eighteen months.   8.4 Limitations.   (a) The Parent
Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to indemnification for Indemnified
Losses under Section 8.1 for breaches of the Company\'s representations and
warranties made in Article II, until Indemnified Losses exceed $290,000 in
the aggregate (at   57   which point the Parent Indemnified Persons will
be entitled to indemnification from and against all Indemnified Losses
relating back to the first dollar).   (b) The Parent Indemnified Persons
acknowledge and agree that after the Closing, notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, their sole and exclusive remedy
for indemnification for Indemnified Losses or otherwise, including under
Sections 1.5 and 6.4, shall be in accordance with, and limited solely to, the
Escrow Funds under the Escrow Agreement; provided, that Parent shall have
recourse against any Preferred Stockholder for breach by such Preferred
Stockholder of any representations, warranties, covenants, certifications or
agreements in any documents delivered by such Preferred Stockholder in
connection with the Agreement, including the Letter of Transmittal. For
purposes of clarification, for a period of 15 months from the Closing Date,
that portion of the Escrow Funds equaling $4,350,000 (based on the Average
Closing Stock Price) shall be available for the satisfaction of any
Indemnified Losses which the Parent Indemnified Persons are entitled to under
this Article VIII or otherwise to satisfy any portion of the Working Capital
Adjustment under Section 1.5 or to pay Company Acquisition Expenses as
provided in Section 10.7. For a period of 18 months from the Closing Date,
all of the Escrow Funds shall be available for any Indemnified Losses which
the Parent Indemnified Persons are entitled to under this Article
VIII arising from fraudulent misrepresentations or warranties, willful
breaches of representations or warranties, or fraudulent or willful breaches
of covenants and agreements.   (c) All materiality qualifications contained
in the Company\'s representations and warranties in this Agreement or any
document delivered pursuant hereto, including without limitation the terms
"Company Material Adverse Effect" and "Company Material Adverse Change,"
shall be taken into account under this Article VIII solely for purposes of
determining whether a breach or violation has occurred for which an indemnity
obligation exists. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, all such
qualifications shall be ignored and not given effect for purposes of
determining whether the $290,000 threshold set forth in Section 8.4 has been
surpassed, or determining the amount of any Indemnified Losses resulting from
any such breach or violation.   8.5 Notice of Claim; Satisfaction of
Claim.   (a) In the event that a party seeking indemnification
(an "Indemnified Party") seeks indemnification hereunder or under the
Escrow Agreement at any time, such Indemnified Party shall give written
notice in the event that such indemnity is sought from the Escrow and
otherwise to the Person from whom such indemnity is sought (in either case,
an "Indemnifying Party") specifying the facts constituting the basis for such
claim and the amount, to the extent known, of the claim asserted. The
Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid the amount of any
undisputed, valid and determinable claim not more than twenty (20) calendar
days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of
such amount. If the Indemnifying Party disputes the validity or amount of any
such claim, the Indemnifying Party shall so notify the Indemnified Party in
writing within fourteen (14) calendar days after the Indemnified Party
provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of such claim and the amount
thereof, specifying in reasonable detail the points of disagreement. Upon
receipt of such notice of dispute, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly consult with the Indemnifying Party with respect to such points of
disagreement in an effort to resolve the dispute. If any such dispute  
58   cannot be resolved by the Indemnified Party and Indemnifying Party
within thirty (30) calendar days after the Indemnified Party receives the
notice of dispute, then either of such parties can sue the other party in a
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 10.10. The Parties
shall reasonably promptly following request therefor make available to each
other all relevant information in their possession relating to such claim,
subject to reasonable protection of attorney client and attorney work product
privileges.   (b) Pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement and in addition to, and not in limitation of, the provisions of
Section 1.12, the Parties hereby agree that the Representative is fully
authorized and empowered on behalf of each of the Preferred Stockholders to
accept notice of, respond to, settle and resolve any and all matters or
disputes relating to Escrow claims brought by a Parent Indemnified Person
hereunder. Any action taken by the Representative may be considered by Parent
to be the action of each Preferred Stockholder for whom such action was taken
for all purposes of this Agreement and each Preferred Stockholder shall be
bound by any such action of the Representative.   8.6 Right to Contest
Claims of Third Persons. If an Indemnified Party believes that it is entitled
to indemnification because of a claim (a "Third Person Claim") asserted by
any claimant other than an Indemnified Party (a "Third Person"), such
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt notice thereof
after such assertion is actually known to such Indemnified Party; provided,
however, that the right of a Person to be indemnified in respect of Third
Person Claims for which such notice is required shall not be
adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to
the extent that, the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. If a Parent
Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Section 8.6 and the Third
Person Claim seeks recovery of Indemnified Losses in an amount which is less
than the remaining amount of Escrow Funds which do not represent Claimed
Amounts (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) or Disputed Amounts, or if a
Stockholder Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Section 8.6,
then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party, to assume the defense, prosecution, settlement or
compromise of such Third Person Claim; provided that the Indemnifying Party,
or if a Stockholder Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this
Section 8.6, has unconditionally acknowledged to the Indemnified Party in
writing to indemnify the Persons to be indemnified hereunder with respect to
such Third Person Claim. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party may participate in
(but not control) the defense of any Third Person Claim with its own counsel
at its own expense; provided, however, that if separate representation of the
Indemnified Party in connection with any such Third Person Claim is necessary
to avoid a conflict of interest, such representation shall be at the expense
of the Indemnifying Party; provided further, that if injunctive relief is
being sought by the Third Person against the Indemnified Party in connection
with such Third Person Claim, then that portion of the Third Person Claim for
which injunctive relief is being sought shall, at the option of the
Indemnified Party, be controlled by the Indemnified Party at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party. To the extent the proposed settlement of any Third
Person Claim involves amounts in excess of the Escrow Funds which do not
represent Claimed Amounts or Disputed Amounts or otherwise does not provide
the Parent Indemnified Party with a complete release with respect to such
matter, such settlement shall be subject to the written consent of Parent.
The failure of the Indemnifying Party, to respond in writing to the aforesaid
notice of the Indemnified Party with respect to any Third Person Claim within
twenty (20) days after receipt thereof shall be deemed an election not to
defend the same.   59   If the Indemnifying Party does not so acknowledge
the obligation of the Indemnifying Party to indemnify and assume the defense
of any such Third Person Claim in the manner set forth above, and with
respect to all Third Person Claims, (a) the Indemnified Party may assume and
control the defense of such claim, in such manner as it may deem appropriate,
including, but not limited to, settling such claim on such terms as the
Indemnified Party may deem appropriate, after, first giving notice of the
proposed terms of any such settlement to the Indemnified Party and providing
the Indemnified Party with an opportunity to assume at that time the defense
of the same by providing the unconditional acknowledgment and reimbursement
described above, and, subject to the procedures set forth in Section 8.5
above, the applicable Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for paying the
full amount of the costs of defense for any Third Party Claim, and (b) the
Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the defense of such
action, with its own counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party
thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the Indemnified Party
defended such Third Person Claim or the amount or nature of any such
settlement, the Indemnifying Party shall have the burden to prove by clear
and convincing evidence that conduct of the Indemnified Party in the defense
and/or settlement of such Third Person Claim constituted gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The parties to this Agreement and to the Indemnification
Agreement shall reasonably promptly following request therefor make available
to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to any
Third Person Claim, subject to reasonable protection of attorney client and
attorney work product privileges, and shall cooperate in the
defense thereof.   8.7 Exclusive Remedies. Anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the indemnification rights set
forth in this Article VIII, all of which are subject to the terms,
limitations, and restrictions of this Article VIII, shall be the exclusive
remedy after Closing as a result of a breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement under this Agreement; provided, that Parent shall have
recourse against any Preferred Stockholder for breach by such Preferred
Stockholder of any representations, warranties, covenants, certifications or
agreements in any documents delivered by such Preferred Stockholder in
connection with the Agreement, including the Letter of Transmittal. In
addition, such limitations set forth in this Article VIII shall not impair
the rights of any of the Parties: (a) to seek non-monetary equitable relief,
including (without limitation) specific performance or injunctive relief to
redress any default or breach of this Agreement; (b) to seek enforcement,
collection, damages, or such non-monetary equitable relief to redress any
default or breach of any employment agreement or other agreement to be
delivered at or prior to Closing hereunder; or (c) for claims pursuant
to Section 5.7. In connection with the seeking of any non-monetary
equitable relief, each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other
Parties hereto would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties
hereto agrees the other Parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in
accordance with Section 10.10.   8.8 Treatment of Indemnification. With
respect to any indemnity payment under Section 8.1, the Parties agree to
treat, to the extent permitted by Law, all such payments as an adjustment to
the consideration paid for the sale and transfer of the capital stock of the
Company.   60    ARTICLE IX  TERMINATION   9.1 Termination.   (a)
This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger contemplated hereby may be
abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time only as follows:   (i) by
mutual consent of the Company and Parent;   (ii) by either the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent, on the  other hand, if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before October 8,  2004, or such other date, if any, as the
Company and Parent shall agree  upon; provided that no Party may terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this  clause (ii) if such Party\'s failure to
fulfill any of its obligations  under this Agreement shall have directly or
indirectly resulted in the  failure of the Closing to occur on or before said
date; provided further,  that if any waiting periods (that prevent
consummation of the Merger)  imposed by a Government authority have not
expired as of the Closing Date,  such date shall automatically be extended to
such date as such waiting  periods expire (which shall be in no event later
than October 18, 2004);   (iii) by Parent if (A) there shall have been a
breach in any  material respect (individually or in the aggregate) of any
representation  or warranty on the part of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, or (B)  there shall have been a breach in any material respect by
the Company of  any of its covenants or agreements hereunder, and in either
case the  Company has not cured such breach within twenty (20) Business Days
after  notice by Parent thereof, provided that, with respect to clauses (A)
and  (B) above, Parent has not materially breached any of its obligations 
hereunder and failed to timely cure such breach or such breach cannot be 
cured within such twenty (20) Business Day period;   (iv) by Parent, at any
time after 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard  Time on the date which is the first
Business Day following the date  hereof, if the Company has not obtained the
Company Stockholder Approval  by such time and delivered to Parent by such
time a copy of such Company  Stockholder Approval and a certificate
certifying that the same has been  obtained;   (v) by the Company if (A)
there shall have been a breach in  any material respect (individually or in
the aggregate) of any  representation or warranty on the part of Parent or
Acquisition Subsidiary  set forth in this Agreement, or (B) there shall have
been a breach in any  material respect by Parent of any of its covenants or
agreements  hereunder, and Parent has not cured such breach within twenty
(20)  Business Days after notice by the Company thereof, provided that,
with  respect to clauses (A) and (B) above, the Company has not materially 
breached any of its obligations hereunder and failed to timely cure such 
breach or such breach cannot be cured within such twenty (20) Business Day 
period;   61    (vi) by Parent upon the occurrence of any event described
in  Section 7.1(d);   (vii) by Parent if the Company suffers a Company
Material  Adverse Effect or Company Adverse Material Change;   (viii) by
Parent if (i) the Company shall have breached any of  its obligations under
Section 4.6 or 4.10 of this Agreement or (ii) the  Board of Directors of the
Company shall (A) amend, withdraw, modify,  change, condition or qualify the
Company Recommendation in a manner  adverse to Parent or Acquisition
Subsidiary (including as a result of the  occurrence of an Unknown Event),
(B) approve or recommend to the  Stockholders of the Company a Company
Acquisition Proposal (other than by  Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary or their
affiliates), (C) approve or  recommend that the Stockholders of the Company
tender their Company Shares  in any tender or exchange offer that is a
Company Acquisition Proposal  (other than by Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary
or their affiliates) or (D)  approve a resolution or agree to do any of the
foregoing; and   (ix) by either Parent or the Company (provided, if it is
by  the Company such termination must occur prior to the Company obtaining
the  Company Stockholder Approval) if the Board of Directors of the Company 
reasonably determines that a Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a 
Company Superior Proposal; provided, however, that the Company may not 
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)(ix) unless and 
until the Company (A) informs Parent of the terms and conditions of the 
Company Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making the 
Company Acquisition Proposal and (B) otherwise fully cooperates with the 
Company with respect thereto (subject, in the case of this clause (B), to 
the condition that the Company Board of Directors shall not be required to 
take any action that it believes, after consultation with outside legal 
counsel, would violate its fiduciary obligations to the Company or the 
Company\'s Stockholders under applicable law) with the intent of enabling 
Parent to agree to a modification of the terms and conditions of this 
Agreement so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be effected.  
The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the preceding
clauses (ii) through (ix) shall give written notice of such termination to
the other Party in accordance with Section 10.1.   (b) Procedure Upon
Termination. In the event of termination pursuant to this Article X, the
Merger shall be abandoned without further action by the Parties hereto,
provided that the agreements contained in Sections 8.1(b), 8.1(c) and 9.7
hereof shall remain in full force and effect. If this Agreement is terminated
as provided herein, each Party shall return all documents, work papers and
other material (including any copies thereof) of any other Party relating to
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether obtained before or after the
execution hereof, to the Party furnishing the same. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall relieve any party from any liability for any
inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of this Agreement prior to
termination.   62    (c) Breakup Fee. In connection with the negotiation
and signing of this Agreement, the Company acknowledges and agrees that
Parent, its representatives and advisors have devoted significant time and
efforts and have incurred significant expenses in reviewing and analyzing the
business, assets and operations of the Company. The Company and Parent
further agree that the Company shall promptly (and in any event within one
Business Day after the occurrence giving rise to such payment obligation) pay
Parent a fee equal to $2,900,000 in the event that either (A) Parent
terminates this Agreement pursuant to subpart (ii) of Section 9.1(a)(viii),
(B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
9.1(a)(ix), (C) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section

9.1(a)(iv) and within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company
enters into a definitive acquisition, merger or similar agreement to effect a
Company Acquisition Proposal.   ARTICLE X  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

Agreement, the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Releases
and the schedules, exhibits and attachments hereto embody the entire
agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous agreements and
understandings relative to such subject matter.   10.3 Assignment; Binding
Agreement. This Agreement and the various rights and obligations arising
hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be transferred,
delegated or assigned (by operation of Law or otherwise) by Parent, without
the prior written consent of the Representative (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), or by the Company, without the prior written consent
of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided,
however, that Parent shall have the right to transfer and assign its and
Acquisition Subsidiary\'s rights hereunder to any entity which at the time
of such transfer and assignment is controlled by Parent,   64   but
Parent shall not be relieved of any liability or obligation hereunder as
a result of such transfer and assignment.   10.4 Amendment and
Modification. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented only by
a written agreement among Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary, the Company and the
Representative. Any amendment or waiver effected in accordance with this
Section 10.4 shall be binding upon Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary, the
Company, the Representative and each of the Preferred Stockholders and the
other Stockholders of the Company.   10.5 Counterparts. This Agreement may
be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.   10.6 Headings; Interpretation. The Article and Section
headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of the Agreement.
Each reference in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Schedule or Exhibit,
unless otherwise indicated, shall mean an Article or a Section of this
Agreement or a Schedule or Exhibit attached to this Agreement, respectively.
The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting
of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement. Any reference to any Law shall be deemed also
to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the
context requires otherwise. The word "including" shall mean including without
limitation. All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such
gender or number as the circumstances require. Whenever required by the
context, any pronoun used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding
masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns, pronouns
and verbs shall include the plural and vice versa. The use of the words "or",
"either" and "any" shall not be exclusive. "Person" shall mean and include an
individual, a partnership, a joint venture, a corporation, a limited
liability company, a trust, an association, an unincorporated organization, a
Government authority and any other entity. Nothing in the schedules hereto
shall be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a representation or
warranty made herein unless the schedule identifies the exception with
reasonable particularity and describes the relevant facts in reasonable
detail or the applicability of such disclosure to the representation or
warranty is otherwise reasonably apparent. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the mere listing (or inclusion of a copy) of a document or
other item shall not be deemed adequate to disclose an exception to a
representation or warranty made herein (unless the representation or warranty
has to do with the existence of the document or other item itself or the
applicability of such disclosure to the representation or warranty
is otherwise reasonably apparent).   10.7 Expenses. The Company shall pay
all costs and expenses incurred on behalf of the Company in connection with
the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without
limitation, the fees and expenses of its attorneys, accountants, advisors and
other representatives, whether in connection with consultation or
communication with, or other assistance to, Parent or its advisors or
representatives or otherwise (collectively, the "Company Acquisition
Expenses") but only to   65   the extent that such advisors have
presented the Company and Parent, on or prior to the second (2nd) Business
Day prior to Closing, with a final bill reflecting all such amounts due and
owing. To the extent that the aggregate amount of the Company Acquisition
Expenses exceeds $750,000, such amount in excess of $750,000 shall offset and
reduce the amount of the Cash Merger Consideration and shall be deducted as
provided in Section 1.4. Parent shall pay all costs and expenses incurred on
its behalf and the Acquisition Subsidiary in connection with the negotiation,
preparation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the fees and
expenses of its attorneys and accountants. Prior to the Closing, the
Company agrees to deliver to Parent (i) a certificate from each service
provider listed on Schedule 10.7 hereto stating that such service provider
has provided a final bill to the Company and Parent reflecting all amounts
payable by the Company to such service provider in connection with and/or as
a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
a certificate of the Company certifying that there are no additional Company
Acquisition Expenses other than those reflected in the Funds Flow Memorandum.
For the avoidance of doubt, attached hereto as Exhibit G is a flow of funds
memorandum which shall be completed immediately prior to Closing in
substantially the form attached hereto (the "Funds Flow Memorandum")
reflecting the payment of the Company Acquisition Expenses, the deposit of
the Escrow Deposit with the Escrow Agent, the payment of the Initial Cash
Consideration. The Parties agree to cooperate to prepare and deliver the
Funds Flow Memorandum immediately prior to the Closing.   10.8 Remedies
Cumulative. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all rights and
remedies of the Parties under this Agreement are cumulative and without
prejudice to any other rights or remedies under Law.   10.9 Governing Law.
This Agreement shall in all respects be construed in accordance with and
governed by the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without giving
effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof.   10.10 Submission to
Jurisdiction; Waivers. The Company, Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and the
Representative irrevocably agrees that any legal action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment
in respect hereof shall be brought by a party or its successors or assigns
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, County of
New Castle or the federal courts located in Delaware. The Company, Parent,
Acquisition Subsidiary and the Representative, by execution and delivery of
this Agreement, hereby expressly and irrevocably consents and submits with
regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, to the non-exclusive
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. The Company, Parent,
Acquisition Subsidiary and the Representative hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above
named court for any reason other than the failure to serve process in
accordance with this Section 10.10, (b) that it or its property is exempt or
immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such court (whether through judgment or otherwise), and (c) to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law that (i) the suit, action or
proceeding in any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the
venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement or the subject matter hereof or thereof may not  
66   be enforced in or by such court. Each such party hereto waives all
personal service of any and all process upon such party related to this
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement and consents to service of any complaint,
summons, notice or other process upon such party that is made by hand
delivery, certified mail or confirmed facsimile directed to such party at the
address specified in Section 10.1 hereof; and service made by certified mail
shall be complete seven (7) days after the same shall have been posted.  
10.11 No Waiver. Any failure by any of the Parties hereto to comply with any
of the obligations, agreements or conditions set forth herein may be
waived by the other Party or Parties; provided, however, that any such waiver
shall not be deemed a waiver of any other obligation, agreement or
condition.   10.12 Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or
law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination
that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.   10.13 No Third Party Beneficiaries. The
Parties hereby agree that there are no third party beneficiaries to this
Agreement, other than parties entitled to indemnification under Article VIII
and the parties entitled to the benefits of Section 5.7.   * * * *  
67    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the Parties hereto has executed and
delivered this Agreement and Plan of Merger to be legally binding
and effective as of the date first above written.   PARENT:   TEKELEC
