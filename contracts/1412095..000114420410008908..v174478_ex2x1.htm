Honesty Group, HMAUF will receive good title to such Honesty Group Shares,
free and clear of all Liens.

  

Section 3.2 _Organization and Standing_. If such Shareholder is not an

existing and, to the extent relevant, in good standing, under the laws of the

execute and deliver this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which such
Shareholder is a party and to consummate the Transactions. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by such Shareholder and the consummation by such
Shareholder of the Transactions have been duly authorized and no other
corporate or other proceedings on the part of such Shareholder are necessary
to authorize this Agreement and the Transactions. This Agreement is, and upon
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Section 10.2, the
Transaction Documents to which such Shareholder is a party will be, duly
executed and delivered by such Shareholder and constitute or will constitute
the valid, binding, and enforceable obligation of such Shareholder,
enforceable against such Shareholder in accordance with their terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar laws of general
application now or hereafter in effect affecting the rights and remedies of

any of the assets and properties of Honesty Group or any of its Subsidiaries
under, any provision of such Shareholders Constituent Documents or any
Contract to which such Shareholder is a party.

  

Section 3.5 _Consents and Approvals_. No consent, approval, license, permit,
order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any

and understandings of such Shareholder set forth in this Section 3.6 in order
to determine the applicability of such exemption and the suitability of such
Shareholder to purchase the HMAUF Shares. The representations, warranties and
agreements contained in this Section 3.6 are true and correct as of the date
hereof and may be relied upon by HMAUF, and such Shareholder will notify

required to be filed by HMAUF with the SEC in connection with this Agreement
and the Transactions (collectively, the "HMAUF SEC Documents"). As of its
respective filing date, each HMAUF SEC Document complied, or will comply, in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such HMAUF SEC
Document, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Except to the extent that information contained in
any HMAUF SEC Document has been revised or superseded by a later filed HMAUF
SEC Document, none of the HMAUF SEC Documents contains any untrue statement of
a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated
financial statements of HMAUF included in the HMAUF SEC Documents (the "HMAUF
Financial Statements") comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited statements, as permitted by the rules and
regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present
the consolidated financial position of HMAUF as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of HMAUFs operations and cash flows as at the respective
dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial statements
(subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements, to normal year-end
audit adjustments and the omission of notes to the extent permitted by
Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC). As of December 31, 2009, HMAUF
qualified as a "foreign private issuer" and a "smaller reporting company" as
such terms are defined in Rules 3b-4 and 12b-2, respectively, promulgated
under the Exchange Act and has made all filings with the SEC and the OTCBB
required by such status.

  

Section 5.8 _Internal Accounting Controls_. HMAUF maintains a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that:
(a) transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or
specific authorizations, (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (c) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization, and (d) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with
the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken
with respect to any differences. HMAUFs officers have established disclosure
controls and procedures for HMAUF and designed such disclosure controls and
procedures to ensure that material information relating to HMAUF is made known
to the officers by others within those entities. HMAUFs officers have
evaluated the effectiveness of HMAUFs controls and procedures and there is no

  

     



  

  

  

material weakness, significant deficiency or control deficiency, in each case
as such term is defined in Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing
Standard No. 2. Since December 31, 2009, there have been no significant
changes in HMAUFs internal controls or, to HMAUFs Knowledge, in other
factors that could significantly affect HMAUFs internal controls.

  

Section 5.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as disclosed in

described in the notes to the HMAUF Financial Statements. Each required form,
report and document containing financial statements that has been filed with
or submitted to the SEC since inception, was accompanied by the certifications
required to be filed or submitted by HMAUFs chief executive officer and
chief financial officer pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and at the time of
filing or submission of each such certification, such certification was true
and accurate and materially complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder. Neither HMAUF, nor, to the Knowledge
of HMAUF, any representative of HMAUF, has received or otherwise had or
obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of HMAUF or its internal accounting controls,
including any complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that HMAUF has engaged

HMAUF or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the HMAUF
Board or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of HMAUF. To the

connection with this Agreement or the Transactions.

  

Section 5.15 _Minute Books_. The minute books of HMAUF made available to

The IPO Shares and IPO Warrants are registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of
the Exchange Act and HMAUF has taken no action designed to, or which is likely
to have the effect of, terminating the registration of such securities under
the Exchange Act nor has HMAUF received any notification that the SEC
is contemplating terminating such registration.

reports, and statements of deficiencies filed by, assessed against or agreed
to by HMAUF for and during fiscal years 2007 (since inception), 2008 and 2009.

  

(c) The HMAUF Financial Statements reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes

portions thereof through the date of such financial statements. HMAUF is
neither a party to nor is it bound by any tax indemnity, tax sharing or
similar agreement and HMAUF currently has no material liability and will not

MISCELLANEOUS

  

Section 13.1 _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other

pages and Annex I hereto (or at such other address for a party as shall be
specified in writing to all other parties).

  

Section 13.2 _Amendments; Waivers_. No provision of this Agreement may be
waived or amended except in a written instrument signed by HMAUF and the
Majority Stockholder; provided, no Shareholder who has not consented thereto
shall be bound by any such amendment if such amendment would reduce the number
of HMAUF Shares that such Shareholder would receive in the Transactions or
reduce such Shareholders percentage interest in HMAUF after the Closing. No
waiver of any default with respect to any provision,

  

     



  

  

  

condition or requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing
waiver in the future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any
other provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or
omission of any party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the
exercise of any such right.

  

Section 13.3 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

  

Section 13.4 _Counterparts; Facsimile Execution_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts

transmission evidencing a manual signature is legal, valid and binding for all
purposes.

  

Section 13.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Person Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
taken together with all Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules hereto (a) constitutes

Honesty Group and its Subsidiaries any rights or remedies.

  

Section 13.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts
of laws thereof.

  

Section 13.7 _Jurisdiction, Venue and Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  

(a) Each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state
courts of the State of New York and the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York for the purposes of any suit, action or other
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the Transactions.
Each party agrees to commence any action, suit or proceeding relating hereto
only in either such court. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of this Agreement, or any of the Transactions in the state courts of the
State of New York, or the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, and hereby further irrevocably and unconditionally
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such
action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Each Party further irrevocably consents to the service of
process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such suit, action or
other proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by mail or recognized
international courier to such party at its address set forth in this
Agreement, such service of process to be effective upon acknowledgment of
receipt of such registered mail; provided that nothing in this Section 13.7(a)
shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law. The consent to jurisdiction set forth in this Section
13.7(a) shall not constitute a general consent to service of process in the
State of New York and shall have no effect for any purpose except as provided
in this Section 13.7(a). The Parties agree that a final judgment in any such
suit, action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.

  

(b) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LITIGATION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS.

  

     



  

  

  

Section 13.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties. Any purported assignment without
such consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement
will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the
parties and their respective successors and assigns.

  

Section 13.9 _Specific Performance_. HMAUF and the Shareholders each agree
that (a) the other would be irreparably damaged and that money damages would
not adequately compensate the other for a breach by HMAUF on the one hand or
the Shareholders on the other hand, and (b) that HMAUF and the Shareholders
shall therefore be entitled to specifically enforce the obligations of the
Shareholders and HMAUF, respectively, to consummate the Transactions subject
