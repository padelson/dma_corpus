herewith, pursuant to which, among other things, each Principal Stockholder
has agreed to tender all Shares it beneficially owns in the Offer, on the

and in order to induce Parent and the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement,
the Company Board has approved the execution and delivery of the Support
Agreements by the Principal Stockholders;   

WHEREAS, as a condition and an inducement to Parents willingness to enter
into this Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to
this Agreement agree as follows:   

ARTICLE 1 
 THE OFFER AND THE MERGER    

1.1 _The Offer_.   

(a) Provided that the Company shall have complied with its obligations under
_Section 1.2(b)_ and _Section 1.2(c)_, as promptly as practicable after the
date hereof (and in any event no later than October 9, 2009), the Purchaser
shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) commence, within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), the
Offer to purchase for cash all the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price,
subject to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of Shares which, together
with the number of Shares (if any) then owned of record by Parent or
the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser otherwise has,
directly or indirectly, sole voting power, represents at least a majority of
the Shares then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and no less
than a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock of the
Company then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and entitled to
vote in the election of directors or (if a greater majority) upon the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger (collectively, the "
_Minimum Condition_ ") and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or the
Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex
I_.   

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction,
or waiver by Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_ , the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause the Purchaser to) accept for payment and pay for all Shares validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as
practicable after the Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under
applicable Law. The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net
to the seller in cash, without interest, less any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_.   

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in _Annex I_. Parent and the Purchaser
expressly reserve the right to waive any of the conditions and requirements
set forth in _Annex I_ , to increase the Offer Price or to make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that unless otherwise contemplated by this Agreement or as previously
approved by the Company in writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the
Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the
Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum Condition, (v) amend any of the other
conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in  _Annex I_ in a manner
adverse to the holders of Shares or the Company or (vi) extend the Expiration
Date in a manner other than in accordance with this Agreement.   

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20)
Business Days following the commencement of the Offer (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ ") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in
accordance with this Agreement, the time and date to which the Offer has been
so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later time and date to which
the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").   

(e) If, on or prior to the Initial Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition, the
HSR Condition or the Governmental Approval Condition has not been satisfied
or waived by Parent or the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause the Purchaser to), to the extent requested in writing by the Company no
less than two (2) Business Days prior to the scheduled Expiration Date,
extend the Offer for up to two (2) periods each of twenty (20) Business Days
or less, in order to permit the satisfaction of such conditions; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond December 31, 2009 (the " _Initial Outside Date_ ") if any condition to
the Offer has not been satisfied on or prior to the Initial Outside Date; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in the event that on the Initial Outside Date,
(i) all of the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied, or waived by
Parent and the Purchaser, other than the HSR Condition and/or the
Governmental Approval Condition, but the HSR Condition and/or
the Governmental Approval Condition has not been satisfied or (ii) either
Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or their counsel has received comments
from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO, the Offer
Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 which remain unresolved or, if
resolved, require the expiration date of the tender to be extended, the
Initial Outside Date automatically shall be extended by 30 days one time (in
each case, such extended date, the " _Extended Outside Date_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion
without the consent of the Company, but subject to the Companys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Article 7_, extend the Offer for one
or more periods, if, at any then scheduled Expiration Date, any of the
conditions set forth in _Annex I_ shall not have been satisfied or waived. In
addition, subject to the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement (and the
Offer) in accordance with _Section 7.1_, the Purchaser shall extend the
Offer for any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable
rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") (or its staff) or of the Nasdaq
Global Market (" _Nasdaq_ ").   

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if necessary to obtain sufficient Shares to
reach the Short Form Threshold, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion,
provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or more extensions
thereof) of up to twenty (20) Business Days, in accordance with Rule 14d-11
under the Exchange Act. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Offer, the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to)
immediately accept for payment, and promptly pay for, all Shares that are
validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during any such "subsequent offering
period." The Offer Documents will provide for the possibility of
a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the terms of this
_Section 1.1(f)_.   

(g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Article 7_. If this
Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Article 7_, the Purchaser shall
(and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the Offer is validly terminated or
withdrawn by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is validly terminated prior to
the acceptance for payment of Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of the
Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares
to the registered holders thereof.   

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and the Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule
14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with
respect to the Offer that will comply with the applicable provisions of the
federal securities Laws (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include, as
exhibits, the Offer to Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form
of summary advertisement (collectively, together with any amendments and
supplements thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Parent and the Purchaser
agree to cause the Offer Documents to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to holders of Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, if and to the extent that
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and Parent and the Purchaser
agree to cause the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to
be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the
Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC, and Parent and the
Purchaser shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In
addition, Parent and the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its counsel
with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that Parent, the Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time
to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or
the Offer Documents promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written
or oral responses thereto by Parent, the Purchaser, or their counsel. The
Company and its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review any such
written or oral responses and Parent and the Purchaser shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel.   

(i) The Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of
any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend
or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), cash
dividend, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to the Shares occurring
on or after the date hereof and prior to the Purchasers acceptance for
payment of, and payment for, the Shares pursuant to the Offer.   

(j) Nothing in this _Section 1.1_ shall affect any termination rights in
_Section 7.1_.   

1.2 _Company Actions_.   

(a) Contemporaneous with the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company shall, in
a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file with the
SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9
with respect to the Offer that will comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the federal securities Laws (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that
shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.4_, contain the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company shall also include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its
entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together with a summary thereof in accordance
with Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act (regardless of
whether such item is applicable). The Company hereby consents to the inclusion
in the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board Recommendation
and the Fairness Opinion, in each case, consistent with such description in
the Schedule 14D-9. The Company further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to
be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on
the other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as
so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. Parent, the
Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review
the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall
give good faith consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or
changes suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel. In
addition, the Company shall provide Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel
with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt
of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto by the Company or
its counsel. Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written and oral responses and the
Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their
counsel.   

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall, or shall instruct its
transfer agent to, promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to the Purchaser
mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting beneficial owner
lists and any other listings or computer files containing the names and
addresses of the record or beneficial holders of the Shares as of the most
recent practicable date, and such other information and assistance as the
Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating with the
record and beneficial holders of Shares. Except for such steps as are
necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary
to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, Parent and the Purchaser shall hold in confidence the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if
this Agreement shall be terminated, shall promptly deliver (and shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to cause their agents and
Representatives to deliver) to the Company all copies and any extract or
summaries of such information. In addition, in connection with the Offer,
the Company shall, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
third parties to, cooperate with Parent and the Purchaser to disseminate the
Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to any Company Stock
Plan or other Company Benefit Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to
tender Shares in the Offer.   

(c) The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable furnish to Parent
and the Purchaser all information concerning the Company that may be
reasonably required by applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by
Parent or the Purchaser for inclusion in the Schedule TO and Offer
Documents.   

1.3 _The Merger_.   

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
be merged with and into the Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate
corporate existence of the Purchaser shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and the Purchaser shall vest
in the Surviving Corporation, and all of the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and the Purchaser shall become the debts, liabilities and duties
of the Surviving Corporation.   

(b) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall, by virtue of the Merger, be amended and restated so as to
read in its entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit A_ hereto, until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. In
addition, the Company and the Surviving Corporation shall take all
necessary action such that, at the Effective Time, the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated so as to read in its
entirety in the form set forth as _Exhibit B_ hereto, until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.   

(c) The directors of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified,
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and
after the Effective Time, shall continue as the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified,
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   

1.4 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger
(the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on a date
to be specified by the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "), such date to be no
later than the second (2nd) Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all
of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Latham and Watkins LLP, 885 Third Avenue, New York, NY 10022, unless another
time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. On the
Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the Company may agree to in
writing, Parent, the Purchaser and the Company shall cause an
appropriate certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time the Certificate of
Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger, such date and time
hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ".   

1.5 _Meeting of Stockholders to Approve the Merger_.   

(a) If following the Acceptance Date and, to the extent applicable, any
"subsequent offering period," the Short Form Threshold has not been reached
and the Purchaser has not exercised the Top-Up Option, the Company shall
prepare a proxy statement or information statement for the Special Meeting
(together with any amendments and supplements thereto and any other required
proxy materials, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") relating to the Merger and this
Agreement, with the intention that the Proxy Statement be filed with the SEC
and, after clearance from the SEC, printed and mailed to the stockholders of
the Company as promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Date and, to
the extent applicable, any "subsequent offering period." Parent, the Purchaser
and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Proxy
Statement before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel. The Company shall include
the Company Board Recommendation and the Fairness Opinion, together with a
summary thereof in accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act (regardless of whether such item is applicable), in the Proxy
Statement. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and the Purchaser, on the
other hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use
in the Proxy Statement, if and to the extent that it shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable
Law, and the Company agrees to cause the Proxy Statement, as so corrected, to
be filed with the SEC and, if any such correction is made following the
mailing of the Proxy Statement, mailed to holders of Shares, in each case as
and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. The Company shall provide
Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel with copies of any written comments,
and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel
may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement promptly after the Companys receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto by the Company or its counsel.
Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company shall give
due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by Parent, the Purchaser and their counsel.   

(b) If approval of the stockholders of the Company is required under
applicable Law to consummate the Merger (other than pursuant to Section 253
of the DGCL), the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in
accordance with and subject to the requirements of applicable Law: (i) as
promptly as practicable after the later of the Acceptance Date and the
expiration of any "subsequent offer period," in consultation with Parent,
duly set a record date for and, after receipt of SEC clearance of the Proxy
Statement, call and give notice of a special meeting of its stockholders (the
" _Special Meeting_ ") for the purpose of seeking the Company
Stockholder Approval, and convene and hold the Special Meeting and (ii) as
promptly as practicable after the Acceptance Date, file the Proxy Statement
with the SEC and, after clearance from the SEC, cause the Proxy Statement to
be printed and mailed to the stockholders of the Company.   

(c) At the Special Meeting or any postponement or adjournment thereof, Parent
shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares then owned of record by
Parent or the Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser
otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting power in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and to deliver or
provide, in its capacity as a stockholder of the Company, any other approvals
that are required by applicable Law to effect the Merger.   

1.6 _Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders_. Notwithstanding the terms of
_Section 1.5_ , if after the latest of (a) the Acceptance Date, (b) the
expiration of any "subsequent offering period" provided by the Purchaser in
accordance with this Agreement, and (c) any exercise of the Top-Up Option,
Parent, the Purchaser, and their respective Subsidiaries shall then hold,
in the aggregate, at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding shares of
each class of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote on the adoption
of this Agreement under applicable Law (the " _Short Form Threshold_"),
Parent and the Purchaser agree to take all necessary and appropriate action
to cause the Merger to become effective promptly without a meeting
of stockholders of the Company in accordance with Section 253 of the
DGCL.   

1.7 _Top-Up Option_.   

(a) The Company hereby grants to the Purchaser an irrevocable option (the "
_Top-Up Option_ "), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, to purchase at a price per share equal to the
Offer Price an aggregate number of Shares (the " _Top-Up Option Shares_ ") up
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or the Purchaser at
the time of exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one (1) Share more
than ninety percent (90%) of the Shares then outstanding on a fully diluted
basis (after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance of
Shares pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (assuming
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); _provided_ ,  _further_ , that in
no event shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of Shares
in excess of the Companys total authorized and unissued Shares. Upon
Parents request, the Company shall cause its transfer agent to certify in
writing to Parent the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and after giving effect
to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Purchaser may pay the
Company the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares,
at the option of Parent, either in cash or by delivery of a promissory note
(the " _Promissory Note_ ").   

(b) Provided that no applicable Law shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or
otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, the Purchaser may exercise
the Top-Up Option on one or more occasions, in whole or in part, on or after
the Acceptance Date (at the election of the Purchaser) and prior to the
earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the valid termination of
this Agreement.   

(c) Each time that the Purchaser wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, the
Purchaser shall send to the Company a written notice (a " _Top-Up Exercise
Notice_ ") specifying the denominations of the certificate or certificates
evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares that the Purchaser wishes to receive, and
the place, time and date for the closing of the purchase and sale pursuant to
the Top-Up Option (the " _Top-Up Closing_ "). The Company shall, promptly
after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice, deliver a written notice to the
Purchaser confirming the number of Top-Up Option Shares and the aggregate
purchase price therefor (the " _Top-Up Notice Receipt_ "). At the Top-Up
Closing, the Purchaser shall pay the Company the aggregate price required to
be paid for the Top-Up Option Shares by delivery of cash or the Promissory
Note in an aggregate principal amount equal to that specified in the Top-Up
Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to the
Purchaser a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Option
Shares. Such certificates may include any legends that are required
by applicable Law.   

(d) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and for so long as this
Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof, the
Company agrees that it shall maintain, free from preemptive rights,
sufficient authorized but unissued Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement
so that the Top-Up Option may be exercised without additional authorization
of Shares, after giving effect to all other options, warrants, convertible
securities and other rights to purchase Shares.   

1.8 _Directors of the Company_.   

(a) Upon the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer and for so long
thereafter as Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries directly or indirectly own
in the aggregate more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Shares,
Parent shall be entitled to designate for appointment or election to
the Company Board, upon written notice to the Company, such number of
directors, rounded up to the next whole number, as is equal to the product
obtained by multiplying the total number of directors on the Company Board
(after giving effect to the directors designated by Parent pursuant to
this sentence) by the percentage that the number of Shares so owned by Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding. In furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon request of
Parent, promptly cause Parents designees (and any replacement designees in
the event that any designee shall no longer be on the Company Board) to be
so appointed or elected to the Company Board and, in furtherance thereof, to
the extent necessary, increase the size of the Company Board, obtain the
resignation of such number of its directors or amend the Company Bylaws as is
necessary to give effect to the foregoing provision. At such time, the
Company shall also, upon the request of Parent, cause such persons designated
by Parent to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next
whole number) as is on the Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company
Board, subject to compliance with applicable Law and the rules of Nasdaq, and
(ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary
and each committee of each such board (or similar body). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, until the Effective Time, the Company Board shall have at least
two (2) directors who are, or who have been nominated by, directors of the
Company on the date of this Agreement.   

(b) In the event that Parents designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_, until the Effective Time, the
Company Board shall have at least such number of directors as may be required
by the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules or the federal securities Laws who are
considered independent directors within the meaning of such rules and Laws ("
_Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in such event, if
the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below the number of
directors as may be required by such rules or securities Laws for any reason
whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to
designate persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other
Independent Director then remains, the other directors shall designate such
number of directors as may be required by the rules of Nasdaq and the federal
securities Laws, to fill such vacancies who shall not be stockholders or
affiliates of Parent or the Purchaser, and such Persons shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this subsection (b), at all times from the election of Parents
designees in accordance with _Section 1.8(a)_ through the Effective Time,
Parents designees shall constitute a majority of the Company Board.   

(c) The Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to
fulfill its obligations under  _Section 1.8(a)_, including mailing to the
stockholders of the Company the information required by such Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1 (which the Company shall mail together with the Schedule 14D-9
if it receives from Parent and the Purchaser the information below on a basis
timely to permit such mailing). Parent and the Purchaser shall supply the
Company such information with respect to Parent and the Purchaser and their
nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 as is necessary in connection with the appointment of any
of Parents designees under _Section 1.8(a)_. The provisions of _Section
1.8(a)_ are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that the Purchaser,
Parent or any of their affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of
Shares as a matter of law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.   

(d) Following the election or appointment of Parents designees pursuant to
_Section 1.8(a)_ and prior to the Effective Time, the approval by affirmative
vote or written consent of all of the Independent Directors then in office
(the " _Independent Director Approval_ ") shall be required to authorize (i)
any amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any
extension by the Company of time for performance of any obligation or action
under this Agreement by Parent or the Purchaser, (iii) any waiver, exercise
or enforcement of any of the Companys rights under this Agreement or (iv)
any amendment of the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws in a manner that
adversely affects holders of Company Common Stock. The authorization of any
such matter by a majority of the Independent Directors shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, constitute the authorization of such matter by
the Company Board, and no other action on the part of the Company or any
other director of the Company shall be required to authorize such
matter.   

(e) The parties hereto agree to reasonably cooperate to complete the Internal
Reorganization (as defined below) steps required to be completed prior to the
Closing, in a manner that is tax efficient and that does not adversely affect
the parties hereto or the stockholders of the Company.   

ARTICLE 2 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER    

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, the Purchaser, the Company or
the holders of any of their respective securities:   

(a) _Conversion of the Shares_. Each Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance
with _Section 2.1(b)_ and other than Dissenting Shares, shall be converted
into the right to receive the Offer Price (the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, less any withholding of
Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_,
upon surrender of the certificate formerly representing such Shares in
accordance with _Section 2.2_. From and after the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Share shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Share in accordance with
_Section 2.2_, without interest thereon.   

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All Shares that
are held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by any Company
Subsidiary, and all Shares owned of record by Parent, the Purchaser or any of
their respective wholly-owned Subsidiaries shall be cancelled and shall cease
to exist, with no payment being made with respect thereto.   

(c) _Purchaser Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Purchaser (the " _Purchaser Common Stock_ ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one (1) newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.   

(d) _Adjustment to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Shares), cash dividend, reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other
like change with respect to the Shares occurring on or after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time.   

2.2 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.   

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent for purposes of
effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in connection with the
Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). At or promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent or the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares
shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, together
with the aggregate Option Payments and Warrant Payments. Such funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent, in its sole discretion,
pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the Shares.
Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders
of Shares.   

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of
record of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ "), which Shares were
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii) instructions for
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the
Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent,
and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal, duly executed and in proper
form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such Certificates
shall receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by
such Certificates less any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in
accordance with  _Section 2.2(e)_. Any Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment
shall have paid any transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not required to be paid. Until surrendered as contemplated
hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash
as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.   

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.   

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. At any time
following twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it
any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates,
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates and compliance with
the procedures in _Section 2.2(b)_, without interest and less any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section
2.2(e)_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor
the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.   

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the relevant Offer Price, Merger Consideration, Option Payment
or Warrant Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
of Shares, Company Options or Company Warrants, as applicable, such
amounts that Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, the rules and Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder or any provision of applicable Law, including with respect
to stock transfer Taxes payable by the Company. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld by Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent and remitted to the relevant Governmental Entity, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the holder of Shares, Company Options or Company Warrants, as applicable, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent.   

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_
hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held
by a holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for
such Shares in accordance, and who complies in all respects, with Section 262
of the DGCL (such Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead
represent the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with, and to the extent provided by, Section 262 of the
DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws or
loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other
applicable Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed
to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be
exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest and less any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law
in accordance with  _Section 2.2(e)_. The Company shall give Parent notice
of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair value
of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), make any payment
with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise,
any such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to
do any of the foregoing.   

2.4 _Treatment of Options; Restricted Stock; Stock Plans_.   

(a) _Treatment of Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board
(or, if appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate
resolutions and take all other actions necessary and appropriate to provide
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexpired and unexercised
option to purchase Shares (the " _Company Options_ "), under any
equity incentive plan of the Company, including the Companys Amended and
Restated 2003 Management and Directors Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock
Plans_ "), or any other plan, agreement or arrangement, whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each
former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall receive at the
Effective Time, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option
and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash of an amount equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares previously subject to such Company
Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Option (such
amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Option Payments_ ")
(less any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to
be withheld in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_). From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment, if any, of the Option Payment.   

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each unvested Share subject to forfeiture restrictions, repurchase rights or
other restrictions under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan agreement
or arrangement (" _Restricted Stock_ ") shall vest in full and all
restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions or repurchase
rights) otherwise applicable to such Restricted Stock shall lapse and the
Restricted Stock shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest, as provided in  _Section 2.1(a)_, less any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with  _Section
2.2(e)_.   

(c) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. After the Effective Time, all
Company Stock Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options,
Restricted Stock or other rights with respect to Shares shall be granted
thereunder.   

2.5 _Treatment of Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase
Shares that is issued, unexpired and unexercised immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Company Warrants_ ") and not terminated pursuant to
its terms in connection with the Merger shall, in accordance with its terms,
entitle the holder thereof to receive a payment in cash of an amount equal to
the product of (i) the total number of Shares previously subject to such
Company Warrant and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Warrant (such
amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Warrant Payments_ ")
(less any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable Law to
be withheld in accordance with _Section 2.2(e)_). From and after the
Effective Time, any Company Warrant shall no longer be exercisable by the
former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment, if
any, of the Warrant Payment.   

ARTICLE 3 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY    

Except as set forth in (i) the Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date
hereof (without giving effect to any amendment to any such Company SEC
Document filed on or after the date hereof and excluding any disclosures that
contain general cautionary, predictive or forward-looking statements set
forth in any section of a Company SEC Document entitled "risk factors"
or constituting "forward-looking statements" or any other sections of such
filings) or (ii) the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent
and the Purchaser prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ", it being agreed that any disclosure contained in any
Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall qualify or modify each of
the representations and warranties set forth in this _Article 3_ to the
extent the applicability of the disclosure to such other section is
reasonably apparent from the text of the disclosure made), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and the Purchaser as follows:   

3.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company and each Company Subsidiary

assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company
and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction (whether federal, state, local or
foreign) where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or
assets or the nature or conduct of its business makes such qualification
or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Third Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company
Certificate_ "), as attached hereto in _Section 3.1(a)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, and the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws of
the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ "), which is incorporated by reference as

December 31, 2008, are complete and correct copies of such documents and
contain all amendments thereto as in effect on the date of this Agreement. The
Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws are in full force and effect and
the Company is in compliance with their terms. Except as described in
_Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company has made
available to Parent complete and accurate copies of the minutes and, in the
case of action by the Company Board or the committees thereof, written
consents (or, in the case of minutes or written consents that have not yet
been finalized, drafts thereof) of all meetings of the stockholders of the
Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries, the Company Board and the board
of directors of each of the Company Subsidiaries and the committees of each of
such boards of directors, in each case, held since January 1, 2007. Such
minutes and written consents made available to Parent contain true, complete
and correct records, in all material respects, of all meetings and other

3.2 _Company Subsidiaries_.   

(a) Each of the Company Subsidiaries, together with the jurisdiction of
organization of each such Company Subsidiary, is set forth on _Section
3.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The Company or another Company
Subsidiary owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests of each of the Company
Subsidiaries, free and clear of any Liens, and all of such shares of capital
stock or other Equity Interests have been duly authorized and validly issued
and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. There are no
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights, convertible securities
or other agreements or commitments of any character relating to the issuance,
transfer, sales, delivery, voting or redemption (including any rights of
conversion or exchange under any outstanding security or other instrument)
for any of the capital stock or other equity interests of, or other ownership
interests in, any Company Subsidiary.   

(b) Except as described in _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the Company does not own or control, directly or indirectly, any
Equity Interest in any Person, or have any obligation nor has it made any
commitment to acquire any such Equity Interest, to provide funds to, or to

otherwise) in any other Person.   

3.3 _Capitalization_.   

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 100,000,000
shares of common stock, no par value, of the Company (the " _Company Common
Stock_ ") and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "). As of September 24, 2009, (A)
10,182,842 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and outstanding, (B) no
shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, (C) 93,559
shares of Company Common Stock were issued and held in the treasury of the

the exercise of outstanding Company Options and Company Warrants will
be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and free of preemptive rights. As
of the date of this Agreement, (i) no shares of Company Preferred Stock are
issued and outstanding and (ii), other than 13,528 phantom stock
awards granted to directors of the Company, there are no outstanding or
authorized stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards or other rights
granted by the Company or its Subsidiaries that are linked in any way to the
Company Common Stock or the value of the Company or any part thereof.   

(b) _Section 3.3(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of
the close of business on September 23, 2009, each outstanding Company Option,
Company Warrant, Equity Interest or other right to subscribe for, purchase or
acquire from the Company any capital stock of the Company or rights that are
linked in any way to capital stock of the Company granted by the Company or
its Subsidiaries, including any stock appreciation rights or phantom stock
awards, and with respect to each outstanding Company Option, the name of the
holder thereof and the date of grant and exercise price thereof. Each grant
of Company Options was duly authorized no later than the date on which the
grant of such Company Option was by its terms to be effective (the "
_Grant Date_ ") by all necessary corporate action, including, as applicable,
approval by the Company Board (or a duly constituted and authorized committee
thereof) and any required stockholder approval by the necessary number of
votes or written consents; such grant was made in accordance with the terms
of the applicable compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, the
Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws, including the Nasdaq Marketplace

Company Subsidiary is in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits,
and all of the Company Permits are valid and in full force and effect, except
for such non-compliance, invalidity or failure to be in full force and effect
that, individually or in the aggregate, would not be material to the Company

(such documents and any other documents filed by the Company with the SEC, as
have been amended since the time of filing, collectively, the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). As of their respective filing dates the Company SEC Documents
(a) did not (or with respect to Company SEC Documents filed after the date

make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading and (b) complied in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act, as the case may be, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable

reflect the books and records of the Company and its consolidated
Company Subsidiaries in all material respects, (ii) have been or will be, as

and recurring year-end adjustments that are not material in amount or nature
and as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q, Form 8-K or any successor or
like form under the Exchange Act) and (iii) fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position and the results of operations,
cash flows and changes in stockholders equity of the Company and its
consolidated Company Subsidiaries as of the dates and for the periods
referred to therein.   

3.8 _Internal Controls; Sarbanes-Oxley Act_.   

(a) The Company has and, to the extent required by Law, each of the Company
Subsidiaries have, designed and maintain a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company (i) has designed and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange
Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SECs rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and (ii) has disclosed to the Companys auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (and has made summaries of such
disclosure to the audit committee, if any, available to Parent) (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information and (B) any fraud or allegation of fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting.
The Company is in compliance in all material respects with (x) all effective
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (y) the applicable Nasdaq
Marketplace Rules. Since January 1, 2009, the Company has not identified any
material weaknesses in internal controls.   

(b) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company is not aware of any facts or
circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer from giving (i) the certifications required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in
each case, without qualification, when next due.   

(c) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or
has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off balance sheet
partnership or any similar contract or arrangement (including any Contract
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
unconsolidated affiliate, including any structured finance, special purpose
or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any "off balance
sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K under the
Exchange Act)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract
is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in the
Companys published financial statements or other Company SEC
Documents.   

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary nor any director, officer, agent, employee or Affiliate of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is aware of any action, or any allegation
of any action, or has taken any action, directly or indirectly, (i) that
would constitute a violation in any material respect by such Persons of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder the (" _FCPA_ "), including making use of the mails or
any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance
of an offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of the payment of any
money, or other property, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the
giving of anything of value to any "foreign official" (as such term is
defined in the FCPA) or any foreign political party or official thereof or
any candidate for foreign political office, in contravention of the FCPA, or
(ii) that would constitute an offer to pay, a promise to pay or a payment of
money or anything else of value, or an authorization of such offer, promise
or payment, directly or indirectly, to any employee, agent or representative
of another company or entity in the course of their business dealings with
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in order to induce such person to act
against the best interest of his or her employer or principal.   

3.9 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. Except for those liabilities and
obligations (a) reserved against or provided for in the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2008 or in the notes thereto,
(b) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
since December 31, 2008 and prior to the date hereof and (c) set forth on
_Section 3.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has any liabilities or obligations of any nature,
whether or not accrued, known or unknown, absolute, determined, determinable,
fixed or contingent and whether or not required to be recorded or reflected
on a balance sheet under GAAP, that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.   

3.10 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since June 30, 2009, the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries has conducted its business only in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, and (a) there has not been
any Company Material Adverse Effect or any fact(s), change(s), event(s),
development(s) or circumstances that, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect and (b) there has not been any action or event that, if taken
on or after the date of this Agreement without Parents consent, would
violate the provisions of _Section 5.1_.   

3.11 _Employee Benefit Plans_.   

(a) _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete list of each material "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("
_ERISA_ ") (whether or not subject to ERISA), and any other material plan,
policy, practice, agreement, understanding or arrangement (whether written or
oral) providing compensation or other benefits to any current or former
director, officer, employee or individual consultant (or to any dependent or
beneficiary thereof) of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined
below), which are now, or were within the past six (6) years,
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate, and under which the Company or any ERISA Affiliate has any
material obligation or liability, whether actual or contingent, including,
without limitation, all material incentive, bonus, deferred compensation,
change in control, retention, termination, severance, retirement, vacation,
holiday, sick pay, cafeteria, health or welfare benefit, retiree health or
welfare benefit, salary continuation, life insurance, tuition reimbursement,
employee assistance, legal services, stock purchase, stock option,
stock appreciation, phantom stock, restricted stock or other stock-based
compensation plans, policies, practices or arrangements (each a " _Company
Benefit Plan_ "). _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets
forth (i) a separate, complete list of each Company Benefit Plan that is an
"employee pension plan", as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, subject to
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA, Section 412 or 430 of the Code, or any
comparable Law governing defined benefit pension plans, other than
Multiemployer Plans (" _Title IV Plan_ "), and (ii) a separate, complete list
of each Company Benefit Plan that is a multiemployer plan, as defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA (" _Multiemployer Plan_ "), or is or has been subject
to Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA. For purposes of this _Section 3.11_, "
_ERISA Affiliate_ " shall mean any entity (whether or not incorporated) other
than the Company that, together with the Company, is considered under common
control and treated as one employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of
the Code.   

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered or
made available to Parent complete copies where applicable of (i) each Company
Benefit Plan (or, if not written a written summary of its material terms),
including all current plan documents, trust agreements, insurance contracts
or other funding vehicles and all material amendments thereto, (ii)
all material written summaries and summary plan descriptions, (iii) the most
recent annual report (Form 5500 series) filed with the IRS with respect to
such Company Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recent actuarial report or other
financial statement, if any, relating to such Company Benefit Plan, (v) the
most recent determination or opinion letter, if any, issued by the IRS with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan and any pending request for such a
determination or opinion letter, and (vi) all filings made by the Company
within the past two (2) years under the Voluntary Compliance Resolution or
Closing Agreement Program or the Department of Labor Delinquent Filer
Program.   

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects
in accordance with its terms and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the
Code, and contributions required to be made under the terms of any of the
Company Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement have been timely made
or, if not yet due, have been properly reflected on the most recent
consolidated balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company
Financial Statements prior to the date of this Agreement. There has been no
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code and other than a transaction that is exempt under
a statutory or administrative exemption) with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan that is reasonably expected to result in material liability to the
Company or any ERISA Affiliate. No suit, administrative proceeding, action or
other litigation has been brought, or to the knowledge of the Company is
threatened, against or with respect to any such Company Benefit Plan,
including any audit or inquiry by the IRS or United States Department of
Labor (other than routine benefits claims) that is reasonably expected to
result in material liability to the Company or any ERISA Affiliate.   

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code either (i) has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS as to its qualified status, (ii) may rely upon a prototype
opinion letter or (iii) has a remaining period of time in which to apply for
or receive such letter and to make any amendments necessary to obtain a
favorable determination, and to the knowledge of the Company, each Company
Benefit Plan which is required to be registered under applicable non-U.S. Law
has been registered and has been maintained in good standing with applicable
regulatory authorities. To the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has
occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified
status or good standing of any such Company Benefit Plan that could not
reasonably be corrected without liability to the Company.   

(e) The information provided to the Purchaser or its advisors with respect to
the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities (defined as the excess, if any, of
the funding target over the value of plan assets, both as defined in Section
430 of the Code) in the Title IV Plans represents a good faith estimate of
such amount of unfunded benefit liabilities as of the date of such
information and to the knowledge of the Company there was a reasonable basis
for each of the assumptions used in preparing such information, provided,
however, that the parties acknowledge that such information was prepared
using census data derived from the most recently prepared actuarial reports
with respect to such Title IV Plans and that the Company makes no
representation with respect to the reasonableness of relying on such census
data as of any date other than the date of such actuarial reports.   

(f) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has, as of the date of this
Agreement, any outstanding liability in connection with the termination of a
Title IV Plan or under Section 4062 of ERISA to the PBGC or to a trustee
appointed under Section 4042 of ERISA. In accordance with applicable Law,
none of the Title IV Plans have a funded status for 2009 that is "at risk."
All premiums due to the PBGC with respect to the Title IV Plans maintained by
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate have been paid, except as could reasonably
be corrected without material liability to the Company or any ERISA
Affiliate. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has withdrawn in
a complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan prior to the
Closing Date. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has as of the date
of this Agreement any withdrawal liability from any Multiemployer Plan under
Section 4201 of ERISA, nor has any of them incurred any liability due to
termination or reorganization of a Multiemployer Plan.   

(g) _Section 3.11(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete list of each Company Benefit Plan which provides for coverage of
post-retirement welfare benefits for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant, except as may be required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or similar law.   

(h) Except as set forth on Section 3.11(h) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether alone or in
connection with any subsequent event(s)) will result in any payment becoming
due to any employee or accelerate the time of payment, vesting, funding or
set aside of Company assets to pay compensation or benefits under, or
increase the amount payable pursuant to, any of the Company Benefit Plans. No
amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) as a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1 Q/A 15) under any Company Benefit
Plan is reasonably expected to be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b) of the Code).   

3.12 _Labor Matters_.   

(a) Except as set forth on _Section 3.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any labor
or collective bargaining agreement, there are no labor or collective
bargaining agreements which pertain to employees of Company or any Company
Subsidiary, and there are no employees of Company or any Company Subsidiary
that are otherwise represented by any labor organization. The Company has
delivered or otherwise made available to the Purchaser true, correct and
complete copies of the labor or collective bargaining agreements listed on
_Section 3.12(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, together with
all amendments, modifications or supplements thereto.

Schedule, no labor organization or group of employees of Company or any
Company Subsidiary has made a pending demand for recognition, and there are
no representation proceedings or petitions seeking a representation
proceeding presently pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened to
be brought or filed, with the National Labor Relations Board or other labor
relations tribunal. Except as set forth on _Section 3.12(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company, there is no organizing
activity involving Company or any Company Subsidiary pending or threatened by
any labor organization or group of employees.   

(c) There are no (i) strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts or
arbitrations or (ii) material grievances or other labor disputes pending or,
to the knowledge of Company, threatened against or involving Company or any
Company Subsidiary involving any employee. To the knowledge of the Company,
there are no material unfair labor practice charges, grievances or complaints
pending or threatened by or on behalf of any employee or former
employee.   

(d) There are no material complaints, charges or claims against Company or any
Company Subsidiary pending or, to the knowledge of Company, threatened that
could be brought or filed, with any governmental body or based on, arising
out of, in connection with or otherwise relating to the employment or
termination of employment or failure to employ by Company or any Company
Subsidiary, of any individual. The Company and each Company Subsidiary are
in compliance with all Laws relating to the employment of labor, including
all such Laws relating to wages, hours, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2101, et. seq. (" _WARN_ ") or any similar
state or local "mass layoff" or "plant closing" Law, collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, safety and health, workers compensation and
the collection and payment of withholding and/or social security taxes and
any similar tax except for such non-compliance that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. There has been no "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (as
defined by WARN or any similar state or local mass layoff or plant closing
Law) with respect to Company or any Company Subsidiary within the six (6)
months prior to the Closing Date.   

3.13 _Contracts; Indebtedness_.

forty-eight (48) hours or such greater time as necessary to include at least
one (1) entire Business Day (ending at midnight) (the " _Notice Period_ ") in
advance, of its intention to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or
Superior Termination in response to such Superior Proposal, which notice
shall in addition specify the material terms and conditions (including price)
of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Person or group
of Persons making the Superior Proposal), and contemporaneously with
providing such notice shall have provided a copy of the relevant proposed
acquisition agreement and other material documents related thereto with the
party making such Superior Proposal; and    

(2) prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation and/or
Superior Termination in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall,
and shall cause its legal and financial advisors to, during the Notice
Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires
to negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal.   

(f) If during the Notice Period any material revisions are made to the
Superior Proposal to which the final proviso of _Section 5.4(e)_ applies
(including any change in the purchase price in such Superior Proposal), the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
comply with the requirements of such proviso with respect to such new written
notice.   

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company Board
from making a Change of Recommendation to the extent that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to effect a Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors exercise of
their fiduciary obligations to the stockholders of the Company under
applicable Law.   

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be permitted
to recommend an Acquisition Proposal which is not a Superior Proposal; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that any disclosure other than "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of an Acquisition Proposal or an
express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation in favor of the
Offer and the Merger shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation.   

5.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.   

(a) The Company and Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable, (ii) obtain from any
Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or
any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any action or proceeding by
any Governmental Entity (including, without limitation, those in
connection with the HSR Act), in connection with the authorization, execution
and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein, including without limitation the Offer and the Merger,
and (iii) as promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date hereof, make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, and pay any fees
due in connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer and
the Merger required under (A) the Exchange Act, and any other
applicable federal or state securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act (with a request
for early termination under the HSR Act) and (C) any other applicable Law;
_provided_ , that the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in
connection with (x) preparing and filing the Offer Documents, the Schedule
14D-9, the Proxy Statement and any Other Filings, (y) determining whether any
action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is
required, in connection with the consummation of the Offer or the Merger and
(z) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or making any
such filings. The Company and Parent shall furnish to each other
all information required for any application or other filing under the rules
and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.   

(b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party consents, (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) required to
be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable or (iii) required to prevent a Company Material
Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ that the Company and Parent shall coordinate
and cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers should be sought from parties to any Company Material Contracts in
connection with consummation of the Offer or the Merger and seeking any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.   

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section
5.5_, each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of
the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and (iii)
promptly inform the other parties of any communication to or from the Federal
Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity
regarding the Offer or the Merger. Each party hereto will consult
and cooperate with the other parties and will consider in good faith the
views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, except as may
be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by any Law, in connection with
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding, each
party hereto will permit authorized representatives of the other parties to
be present at each meeting or conference relating to such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding (but giving the other
party reasonable prior notice of such meeting) and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion or proposal made or
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with such request,
inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding. The parties shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may
be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Closing to
occur as promptly as practicable, including by defending against any
lawsuits, actions or proceedings, judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
and seeking to have any restraint or prohibition entered or imposed by any
court or other Governmental Entity that is not yet final and nonappealable
vacated or reversed. The Company and Parent will cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, approvals and waivers required by third persons so that all
Company Permits and Contracts of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
will remain in full force and effect after the Effective Time.   

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect
to their businesses and assets as they exist on the date hereof, in
connection with the receipt of any necessary approvals or clearances of a
Governmental Entity (including under the HSR Act), neither Parent nor the
Company (nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates) shall be
required to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their
business in a specified manner, or agree to sell, hold separate or otherwise
dispose of or conduct their businesses in a specified manner, or enter into
or agree to enter into a voting trust arrangement, proxy arrangement,
"hold separate" agreement or arrangement or similar agreement or arrangement
with respect to the assets, operations or conduct of their business in a
specified manner, or permit the sale, holding separate or other disposition
of, any assets of Parent, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries
or affiliates. Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
neither the Company nor Parent shall take or approve any action, and each
shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent any condition or occurrence,
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the likelihood of
obtaining any consent, license, permit, waiver, approval, authorization, or
order of any Governmental Entity required to be obtained by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
transactions contemplated herein.   

5.6 _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party
hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event of which such
party has knowledge the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would cause any
representation or warranty made by such party in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof
to the Effective Time or (b) the failure of the Company, the Purchaser or
Parent, as the case may be, or any Representative thereof, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not cure any breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice or the representations or warranties of the
parties, or the conditions to the obligations of the parties
hereto. Furthermore, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party
hereto of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from
any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against,
relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party which relate to
this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.   

5.7 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and the Purchaser
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior consent of
the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required
by applicable Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United States
securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the relevant
party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow each
other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance. The Company shall provide a meaningful opportunity
to Parent to review and comment upon all formal Company employee
communication programs or announcements with respect to the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company, Parent
and the Purchaser agree that the press release announcing the execution and
delivery of this Agreement shall be a joint release of, and shall not be
issued prior to the approval of each of, the Company and Parent.   

5.8 _Employee Benefit Matters_.   

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time (or, in each
case, until such person earlier ceases to be employed by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective subsidiaries), Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to each Person that is an employee of the
Company or a Company Subsidiary as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each a " _Company Employee_ ") base salary or wages, bonus opportunity and
benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate (not including any value
attributable to equity-based compensation or change in control benefits) than
the base salary or wages, bonus opportunity and benefits provided to such
Company Employee on the date of this Agreement (not including any value
attributable to equity-based compensation or change in control benefits).
Nothing in this Agreement (i) shall require Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective subsidiaries to continue to employ any particular
Company Employee following the Closing Date, (ii) shall be treated as
an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or any other
compensation or employee benefit plan, program or arrangement or (iii) shall
limit the right of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective subsidiaries to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Company
Benefit Plan or any other compensation or employee benefit plan, program or
arrangement following the Closing Date, subject to and in accordance with the
terms and conditions of such Company Benefit Plans or other compensation or
employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements.   

(b) Parent shall ensure that, as of the Closing Date, each Company Employee
receives full credit (for all purposes, including eligibility to participate,
vesting, vacation entitlement and severance benefits, but excluding accrual
under defined benefit plans) for service with the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company or any
Company Subsidiary provides such past service credit under its employee
benefit plans) under each of the comparable employee benefit plans, programs
and policies of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant subsidiary,
as applicable, in which such Company Employee becomes a participant; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such service recognition shall result in any
duplication of benefits. As of the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation or relevant subsidiary to, credit to Company
Employees the amount of vacation time that such employees had earned under
any applicable vacation plan or policy of the Company or Company Subsidiary as
of the Closing Date. With respect to each health or welfare benefit plan
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant subsidiary
for the benefit of any Company Employees, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation or relevant subsidiary to (i) cause to be waived any
eligibility waiting periods, any evidence of insurability requirements and the
application of any pre-existing condition limitations under such plan to the
extent any such periods, requirements or limitations would not have been
applicable under the applicable Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) cause each
Company Employee to be given credit under such plan for all amounts paid by
such Company Employee under any similar Company Benefit Plan for the plan
year that includes the Closing Date for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable plan maintained
by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the relevant subsidiary, as
applicable, for the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.   

(c) This _Section 5.8_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.8_,
express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights or
remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section
5.8_.   

5.9 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.   

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall to the fullest extent permissible under
applicable provisions of the DGCL indemnify and hold harmless all past and
present directors, officers and employees of the Company entitled
to indemnification (the " _Covered Persons_ ") to the same extent such
Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to applicable Law, the Company Certificate, the Company Bylaws, and
the indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of
this Agreement (the " _Indemnification Agreements_ ") for acts or omissions
in their capacity as directors, officers or employees of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. _Section
5.9(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all outstanding
Indemnification Agreements. The Surviving Corporation shall advance
expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred in the
defense of any claims, action, suit, proceeding or investigation with respect
to the matters subject to indemnification pursuant to this  _Section 5.9(a)_
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Company Certificate,
the Company Bylaws, and the Indemnification Agreements; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the director, officer or employee of the Company to whom
expenses are advanced undertakes to repay such advanced expenses to the
Surviving Corporation if it is ultimately determined that such
director, officer or employee is not entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this _Section 5.9(a)_.   

(b) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of Covered Persons for periods at or prior to
the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the Company Certificate and
the Company Bylaws. The Indemnification Agreements, if any, with any Covered
Persons shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms following the Effective Time.   

(c) For six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain for the benefit of the Companys directors and
officers, as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, who
are covered by the directors and officers liability insurance ýpolicy
maintained by the Company, an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for actions or omissions of such officers and directors
prior to the Effective Time in their capacities as such (the " _D andO;
Insurance_") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less
favorable in the aggregate than the Companys existing policy (true and
complete copies of which have been previously provided to Parent) ("
_Equivalent Coverage_ ") or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage
is unavailable, the best available coverage;  _provided_ , _however_ , that,
in satisfying its obligation under this  _Section 5.9(c)_, the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO;
Insurance in excess of 300% (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") of the last annual
premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may, after prior consultation with Parent, purchase
six (6) year "tail" prepaid policies prior to the Effective Time which
policies provide such directors and officers with Equivalent Coverage; 
_provided_ , that the amount paid by the Company shall not be in excess of the
Maximum Amount of the per annum premium rate paid by the Company as of the
date hereof for such policies. If such prepaid policies have been obtained
prior to the Effective Time, the provisions of this  _Section 5.9(c)_ shall
be deemed to have been satisfied and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain
such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.   

(d) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation
or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_.   

(e) The obligations under this _Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any indemnitee to whom this
_Section 5.9_ applies without the consent of such affected indemnitee (it
being expressly agreed that the indemnitees to whom this  _Section 5.9_
applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_).   

5.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair price,"
"business combination," or other anti-takeover Law becomes or is deemed to be
applicable to the Company, Parent or the Purchaser, the Offer, the Merger,
the Top-Up Option or any transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then (a) the Company Board shall
take all action necessary to render such Law inapplicable to the foregoing
and (b) the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby.   

5.11 _Parent Agreement Concerning Purchaser_. Parent agrees to vote all of the
shares of capital stock of the Purchaser beneficially owned by it in favor of
the adoption of this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law.   

5.12 _Financing_.   

(a) Parent and the Purchaser shall use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to (i) maintain in effect the Financing and
the Financing Commitments, (ii) enter into definitive financing agreements
with respect to the Financing and Financing Commitments, so that
such agreements are in effect as promptly as practicable but in any event no
later than the Acceptance Date and (iii) consummate the Financing at or prior
to the Acceptance Date. Parent and the Purchaser shall provide to the Company
copies of all final documents relating to the Financing and shall keep the
Company fully informed of material developments in respect of the financing
process relating thereto. Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Purchaser
shall not agree to, or permit, any amendment or modification of, or waiver
under, the Financing Commitments or other final documentation relating to the
Financing in a manner that (x) would materially delay or prevent the Closing
or (y) is otherwise adverse to the Company in any material respect, without
the prior written consent of the Company. In the period between the date
hereof and the Closing Date, upon request of Parent and the Purchaser, the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with
Parent and the Purchaser in connection with the Financing, including, (A)
preparation of all required financial statements relating to the Company and
its Subsidiaries and any required pro forma financial information, (B)
reasonable participation in meetings and road shows, if any, (C) the
provision of information relating to the Financing reasonably requested
by Parent and the Purchaser, (D) reasonable assistance in the preparation of
offering memoranda, private placement memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents of Parent and the Purchaser and (E) such actions as set forth on
_Schedule III_ hereto. Parent and the Purchaser shall promptly, upon request
by the Company, reimburse the Company for all documented out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Company in connection with such cooperation.   

(b) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent and the
Purchaser to satisfy its obligations under this _Section 5.12(b)_, any of
the Financing or the Financing Commitments (or any definitive financing
agreement relating thereto) expire or are terminated prior to the Closing, in
whole or in part, for any reason, Parent and the Purchaser shall (i)
promptly notify the Company of such expiration or termination and the reasons
therefor and (ii) promptly arrange for alternative financing (which shall be
in an amount sufficient to pay for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from other sources and which do not include
any conditions of such alternative financing that are more onerous than or in
addition to the conditions set forth in the Financing) to replace the
financing contemplated by such expired or terminated commitments or
agreements.   

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.12(b)_,
at any time Parent or the Purchaser may replace the Financing with
alternative financing arrangements which (i) provide Parent and the Purchaser
with sufficient funds to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement prior to or concurrent with the Acceptance Date and (ii) do
not prevent or materially impair or delay the Closing (the " _Financing
Alternative_ "). In the event Parent or the Purchaser replaces the Financing
with any Financing Alternative, the terms of  _Section 5.12(b)_ shall no
longer apply with respect to the Financing, but shall thereafter apply with
respect to the Financing Alternative.   

5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board, or
an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC and take such
other steps as may be reasonably necessary so that the disposition by any
officer or director of the Company who is a covered Person of the Company for
purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder (" _Section 16_") of Shares or Company Options pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Offer and the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for
purposes of Section 16.   

5.14 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Date, the Company will
take all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement
or understanding entered into by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
(including the Employee Arrangements) on or after the date hereof with any of
its officers, directors or employees pursuant to which consideration is paid
to such officer, director or employee to be approved as an "employment
compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement" within the
meaning of Rule 14d-10(d) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy the
requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)
under the Exchange Act.   

5.15 _Stock Exchange Listing_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules
and policies of the Nasdaq to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares from the Nasdaq and the deregistration of the
Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time.   

5.16 _Resignations_. The Company shall cause to be delivered to Parent at the
Closing written evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation
effective as of the Effective Time of those directors of the Company and any
Subsidiary designated by Parent to the Company. At the request of Parent, the
Company shall provide Parent with a true and accurate list of the directors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. From and after the date of delivery of
such list, the Company shall promptly inform Parent of changes to such
list.   

5.17 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be
agreed to without Parents prior written consent.   

5.18 _Scheduled Intellectual Property Filings_. The Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent and use commercially reasonable efforts to provide
information requested by Parent with respect to any annuities, payments,
fees, responses to office actions or other filings required to be made and
having a due date with respect to any Scheduled Intellectual Property within
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date.   

5.19 _Use of Names_. Within thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement,
the Company shall change the name of any Company Subsidiary that comprises,
includes or incorporates "Reheis" and/or "Cabletech" (in whole or in part) to
a name that does not include "Reheis" or "Cabletech" or any name or Mark
confusingly similar to either "Reheis" or "Cabletech." The Company shall
promptly take all actions necessary to effect such change, including filing
any necessary documents with the secretary of state in the jurisdiction of
each such Company Subsidiary.   

5.20 _Title Affidavit_. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent a customary title affidavit, including a non-imputation
affidavit and indemnity, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company,
Parent, the Purchaser and the applicable title insurance company.

8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement.   

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the extent possible.   

8.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent
Disclosure Schedules and Company Disclosure Schedules and the other documents
delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and
undertakings, both written and oral, among the parties, or of any of
them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, are not intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies hereunder.   

8.9 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties other than in connection with a collateral assignment of rights
hereunder to the lenders of the Company, Gentek Holding LLC or any of their
respective Subsidiaries.   

8.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors
and assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, other than
pursuant to Section 5.9, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.   

8.11 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result
of extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine
gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender
shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall
include masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words
"include" and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be
terms of limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this
Agreement to "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to
refer to Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to
this Agreement. All references in this Agreement to "$" are intended to refer
to U.S. dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term
"or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive.   

8.12 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.   

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be applicable
under conflicts of laws principles (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.   

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware
State court, or Federal court of the United States of America, sitting in
Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements
delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees not
to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts, (ii) agrees
that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by law,
in such Federal court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and
effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State
or Federal court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices
in _Section 8.3_. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by
Law.   

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS  _SECTION 8.12(c)_.   

8.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.   

8.14 _Remedies_.   

(a) _Specific Performance_. The parties to this Agreement agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed by the Company in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article 7_,
Parent and the Purchaser will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. The parties acknowledge that the Company
shall not be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement by Parent or the Purchaser or to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions of this Agreement. The terms of this  _Section 8.14_
shall not be deemed to be superseded, amended or modified in any respect
by the terms of any other provisions of this Agreement.   

(b) _Further Limitations_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, the Parent Termination Fee shall, and is intended to be,
the sole and exclusive direct or indirect remedy available to the Company
against the Purchaser, Parent and any of their affiliates in respect of any
liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with,
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including in the
event that Parent or the Purchaser breaches its obligations under this
Agreement. In connection with any breach, Uncured Inaccuracy, termination or
expiration of this Agreement, failure to consummate the Offer or any claim,
suit, proceeding, litigation or action relating thereto, Parent, the Purchaser
and their affiliates shall not, under any circumstances, be obligated to pay
to the Company more than the Parent Termination Fee. Payment of the Parent
Termination Fee will fully, unconditionally and irrevocably release Parent,
the Purchaser and their affiliates from all liability to the Company (and any
other person claiming by, through or on behalf of it).   

8.15 _Non-Recourse_. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of,
or related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as parties hereto, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein. No former, current or future direct or indirect
equity holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners
or assignees of the Company, Parent or the Purchaser or any of their
respective affiliates shall have any liability or obligation for any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, obligations or
liabilities of the Company, Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement or of
or for any action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation, or
proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the breach, termination or failure to
consummate such transactions), in each case whether based on Contract, tort,
strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by piercing the
corporate veil, by a claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another
Person or otherwise.
