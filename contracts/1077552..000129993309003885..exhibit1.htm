and among ASP GT Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<U>Parent</U>&#148;), ASP GT Acquisition
Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (the &#147;<U>Purchaser</U>&#148;),
and GenTek Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;). All capitalized terms used in
this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in <U>Section&nbsp;8.4</U> or as
otherwise defined elsewhere in this Agreement unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>RECITALS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the Purchaser and the Company have
approved this Agreement and the acquisition of the Company by the Purchaser upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the
Purchaser has agreed to commence a tender offer (the &#147;<U>Offer</U>&#148;) to purchase all of the
outstanding common stock, no par value, of the Company (the &#147;<U>Shares</U>&#148;) at a price per share
of $38.00 (such amount or any different amount per Share that may be paid pursuant to the Offer,
the &#147;<U>Offer Price</U>&#148;), payable net to the holder in cash, without interest, less any
withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">WHEREAS, following the acceptance for payment of Shares pursuant to the Offer, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser will be merged with and
into the Company, with the Company continuing as the Surviving Corporation (the &#147;<U>Merger</U>&#148;),
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (as amended from time to
time, the &#147;<U>DGCL</U>&#148;), whereby each issued and outstanding Share (other than Shares to be
cancelled in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.1(b)</U> and other than Dissenting Shares) will be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, payable net to the holder in cash, without
interest, less any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the &#147;<U>Company Board</U>&#148;) has, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;determined that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to, and
in the best interests of, the Company and its stockholders, (ii)&nbsp;approved and declared advisable
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger and
(iii)&nbsp;recommended that the Company&#146;s stockholders accept the Offer, tender their Shares to the
Purchaser in the Offer, and, to the extent applicable, adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger
(the &#147;<U>Company Board Recommendation</U>&#148;);


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and the Purchaser have, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;determined that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the
Purchaser and Parent, and (ii)&nbsp;approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">WHEREAS, Parent has required, as a condition to its willingness to enter into this Agreement,
that the individuals listed on <U>Schedule&nbsp;I</U> hereto (the &#147;<U>Principal Stockholders</U>&#148;)
each enter into a Support Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (collectively, the &#147;<U>Support
Agreements</U>&#148;), simultaneously herewith, pursuant to which, among other things, each Principal
Stockholder has agreed to tender all Shares it beneficially owns in the Offer, on the terms and
subject to the conditions provided for in the Support Agreement, and in order to induce Parent and
the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, the Company Board has approved the execution and
delivery of the Support Agreements by the Principal Stockholders;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">WHEREAS, as a condition and an inducement to Parent&#146;s willingness to enter into this
Agreement, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement, the Employee Arrangements (as
defined herein) have been executed and delivered to Parent; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">WHEREAS, Parent, the Purchaser, and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Offer and the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises contained in this
Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties to this Agreement agree as follows:


<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>ARTICLE 1</B><BR>
THE OFFER AND THE MERGER



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt">1.1 <U>The Offer</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;Provided that the Company shall have complied with its obligations under <U>Section
1.2(b)</U> and <U>Section&nbsp;1.2(c)</U>, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (and in any
event no later than October&nbsp;9, 2009), the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to)
commence, within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the &#147;<U>Exchange Act</U>&#148;), the Offer to
purchase for cash all the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price, subject to: (i)&nbsp;there being
validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number
of Shares which, together with the number of Shares (if any) then owned of record by Parent or the
Purchaser or with respect to which Parent or the Purchaser otherwise has, directly or indirectly,
sole voting power, represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding (determined on a
fully diluted basis) and no less than a majority of the voting power of the shares of capital stock
of the Company then outstanding (determined on a fully diluted basis) and entitled to vote in the
election of directors or (if a greater majority) upon the adoption of this Agreement and approval
of the Merger (collectively, the &#147;<U>Minimum Condition</U>&#148;) and (ii)&nbsp;the satisfaction, or waiver
by Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in <U>Annex I</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by
Parent or the Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth in <U>Annex I</U>, the
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) accept for payment and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer as promptly as practicable after
the Purchaser is legally permitted to do so under applicable Law. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each Share validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be
paid net to the seller in cash, without interest, less any withholding of Taxes required by
applicable Law in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the &#147;<U>Offer to Purchase</U>&#148;)
that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in accordance with this Agreement, including
the Minimum Condition and the other conditions and requirements set forth in <U>Annex I</U>.
Parent and the Purchaser expressly reserve the right to waive any of the conditions and
requirements set forth in <U>Annex I</U>, to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes
in the terms and conditions of the Offer; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that unless otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement or as previously approved by the Company in writing, the Purchaser
shall not (i)&nbsp;decrease the Offer Price, (ii)&nbsp;change the form of consideration payable in the Offer,
(iii)&nbsp;reduce the maximum number of Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv)&nbsp;amend or waive the
Minimum Condition, (v)&nbsp;amend any of the other conditions and requirements to the Offer set forth in
<U>Annex I</U> in a manner adverse to the holders of Shares or the Company or (vi)&nbsp;extend the
Expiration Date in a manner other than in accordance with this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at
midnight (New York City time) on the date that is twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days following the
commencement of the Offer (the &#147;<U>Initial Expiration Date</U>&#148;) or, if the Initial Expiration
Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the time and date to which the Offer has
been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later time and date to which the Initial
Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this Agreement, the &#147;<U>Expiration
Date</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(e)&nbsp;If, on or prior to the Initial Expiration Date, the Minimum Condition, the HSR Condition
or the Governmental Approval Condition has not been satisfied or waived by Parent or the Purchaser,
the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to), to the extent requested in writing
by the Company no less than two (2)&nbsp;Business Days prior to the scheduled Expiration Date, extend
the Offer for up to two (2)&nbsp;periods each of twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days or less, in order to permit
the satisfaction of such conditions; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Purchaser shall
not be required to extend the Offer beyond December&nbsp;31, 2009 (the &#147;<U>Initial Outside Date</U>&#148;)
if any condition to the Offer has not been satisfied on or prior to the Initial Outside Date;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that, in the event that on the Initial Outside Date, (i)&nbsp;all of
the conditions to the Offer have been satisfied, or waived by Parent and the Purchaser, other than
the HSR Condition and/or the Governmental Approval Condition, but the HSR Condition and/or the
Governmental Approval Condition has not been satisfied or (ii)&nbsp;either Parent, the Purchaser, the
Company or their counsel has received comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Schedule&nbsp;TO, the Offer Documents or the Schedule&nbsp;14D-9 which remain unresolved or, if resolved,
require the expiration date of the tender to be extended, the Initial Outside Date automatically
shall be extended by 30&nbsp;days one time (in each case, such extended date, the &#147;<U>Extended Outside
Date</U>&#148;). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion without the
consent of the Company, but subject to the Company&#146;s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
<U>Article&nbsp;7</U>, extend the Offer&nbsp;for one or more periods, if, at any then scheduled Expiration
Date, any of the conditions set forth in <U>Annex I</U> shall not have been satisfied or waived.
In addition, subject to the right of Parent to terminate this Agreement (and the Offer) in
accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;7.1</U>, the Purchaser shall extend the Offer for any period or periods
required by applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations or positions of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;<U>SEC</U>&#148;) (or its staff) or of the Nasdaq Global
Market (&#147;<U>Nasdaq</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(f)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, if necessary to obtain sufficient Shares to reach the Short
Form&nbsp;Threshold, the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion, provide for a &#147;subsequent offering
period&#148; (and one or more extensions thereof) of up to twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days, in accordance with
Rule&nbsp;14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Paying Agent</U>. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent for purposes of effecting the payment of
the Merger Consideration in connection with the Merger (the &#147;<U>Paying Agent</U>&#148;). At or
promptly after the Effective Time, Parent or the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be
entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement, together with the aggregate Option
Payments and Warrant Payments. Such funds shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent, in its sole discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the
Shares. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of Parent, and no
part of such earnings shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Procedures for Surrender</U>. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the
&#147;<U>Certificates</U>&#148;), which Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such
other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, and upon delivery of a letter of transmittal,
duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such Certificates, the holder of such
Certificates shall receive the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificates less any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
<U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>. Any Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment
of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other similar
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not required to be paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash as
contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares</U>. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by
applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(d)&nbsp;<U>Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability</U>. At any time following
twelve (12)&nbsp;months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require
the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto)
made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter
such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the
Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates and compliance with the
procedures in <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(b)</U>, without interest and less any withholding of Taxes required
by applicable Law in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(e)&nbsp;<U>Withholding Rights</U>. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the relevant Offer
Price, Merger Consideration, Option Payment or Warrant Payment otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company Options or Company Warrants, as applicable, such amounts
that Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, the rules and Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder or any provision of applicable Law, including with respect to
stock transfer Taxes payable by the Company. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent and remitted to the relevant
Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of Shares, Company Options or Company Warrants, as applicable, in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(f)&nbsp;<U>Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates</U>. In the event that any Certificates shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to <U>Section&nbsp;2.1(a)</U> hereof;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">2.3 <U>Dissenting Shares</U>. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled to
demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance, and who complies in all
respects, with Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL (such Shares, the &#147;<U>Dissenting Shares</U>&#148;) shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and shall instead represent the right
to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with, and to the
extent provided by, Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise
waives, withdraws or loses his right to appraisal under Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL or other applicable
Law, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting Shares shall cease
and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted, as of the Effective Time, into
and shall be exchangeable solely for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without
interest and less any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
<U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>. The Company shall give Parent notice of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to be paid the fair
value of Dissenting Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld),
make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer to settle or compromise, any
such demands, or approve any withdrawal of any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">2.4 <U>Treatment of Options; Restricted Stock; Stock Plans</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Treatment of Options</U>. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and take all other actions
necessary and appropriate to provide that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each unexpired
and unexercised option to purchase Shares (the &#147;<U>Company Options</U>&#148;), under any equity
incentive plan of the Company, including the Company&#146;s Amended and Restated 2003 Management and
Directors Incentive Plan (the &#147;<U>Company Stock Plans</U>&#148;), or any other plan, agreement or
arrangement, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Company Option shall receive at the Effective
Time, in consideration of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a
payment in cash of an amount equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the total number of Shares previously
subject to such Company Option and (ii)&nbsp;the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Option (such amounts payable hereunder
being referred to as the &#147;<U>Option Payments</U>&#148;) (less any applicable withholding or other Taxes
required by applicable Law to be withheld in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>). From and
after the Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be exercisable by the
former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder to the payment, if any, of the Option
Payment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Treatment of Restricted Stock</U>. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
unvested Share subject to forfeiture restrictions, repurchase rights or other restrictions under
the Company Stock Plans or any other plan agreement or arrangement (&#147;<U>Restricted Stock</U>&#148;)
shall vest in full and all restrictions (including forfeiture restrictions or repurchase rights)
otherwise applicable to such Restricted Stock shall lapse and the Restricted Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in
<U>Section&nbsp;2.1(a)</U>, less any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with
<U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;<U>Termination of Company Stock Plans</U>. After the Effective Time, all Company Stock
Plans shall be terminated and no further Company Options, Restricted Stock or other rights with
respect to Shares shall be granted thereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">2.5 <U>Treatment of Warrants</U>. At the Effective Time, each warrant to purchase Shares
that is issued, unexpired and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (the &#147;<U>Company
Warrants</U>&#148;) and not terminated pursuant to its terms in connection with the Merger shall, in
accordance with its terms, entitle the holder thereof to receive a payment in cash of an amount
equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;the total number of Shares previously subject to such Company Warrant
and (ii)&nbsp;the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share
previously subject to such Company Warrant (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the
&#147;<U>Warrant Payments</U>&#148;) (less any applicable withholding or other Taxes required by applicable
Law to be withheld in accordance with <U>Section&nbsp;2.2(e)</U>). From and after the Effective Time,
any Company Warrant shall no longer be exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only

the other with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that after any approval of this Agreement by the Company&#146;s stockholders, there may

only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.7 <U>Severability</U>. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other conditions
and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible
in an acceptable manner to the end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.8 <U>Entire Agreement</U>. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, Parent Disclosure
Schedules and Company Disclosure Schedules and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and
the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.10 <U>Parties in Interest</U>. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, other than pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.9, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.11 <U>Mutual Drafting; Interpretation</U>. Each party hereto has participated in the
drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations
between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to laws that may be applicable under conflicts of laws principles
(whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and
its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or Federal court of the
United States of America, sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in
connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the parties hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally (i)&nbsp;agrees not to commence any such action or proceeding except in such courts,
(ii)&nbsp;agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined
in such Delaware State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court,
(iii)&nbsp;waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such
Delaware State or Federal court and (iv)&nbsp;waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any
such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on
the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in <U>Section&nbsp;8.3</U>. Nothing
in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(c)&nbsp;EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY.
EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I)&nbsp;NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II)&nbsp;IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III)&nbsp;IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV)&nbsp;IT HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
<U>SECTION&nbsp;8.12(c)</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.13 <U>Counterparts</U>. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by
the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed
to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.14 <U>Remedies</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(a)&nbsp;<U>Specific Performance</U>. The parties to this Agreement agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed by the
Company in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with <U>Article&nbsp;7</U>, Parent
and the Purchaser will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of
the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties acknowledge that the Company shall not be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent or the
Purchaser or to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. The terms of this
<U>Section&nbsp;8.14</U> shall not be deemed to be superseded, amended or modified in any respect by
the terms of any other provisions of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 12%">(b)&nbsp;<U>Further Limitations</U>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, the Parent Termination Fee shall, and is intended to be, the sole and exclusive direct
or indirect remedy available to the Company against the Purchaser, Parent and any of their
affiliates in respect of any liabilities or obligations arising under, or in connection with, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including in the event that Parent or the
Purchaser breaches its obligations under this Agreement. In connection with any breach, Uncured
Inaccuracy, termination or expiration of this Agreement, failure to consummate the Offer or any
claim, suit, proceeding, litigation or action relating thereto, Parent, the Purchaser and their
affiliates shall not, under any circumstances, be obligated to pay to the Company more than the
Parent Termination Fee. Payment of the Parent Termination Fee will fully, unconditionally and
irrevocably release Parent, the Purchaser and their affiliates from all liability to the Company
(and any other person claiming by, through or on behalf of it).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">8.15 <U>Non-Recourse</U>. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are expressly named as parties
hereto, and then only with respect to the specific obligations set forth herein. No former,
current or future direct or indirect equity holders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or
assignees of the Company, Parent or the Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates shall have
any liability or obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements,
obligations or liabilities of the Company, Parent or the Purchaser under this Agreement or of or
for any action, suit, arbitration, claim, litigation, investigation, or proceeding based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby (including the breach,
termination or failure to consummate such transactions), in each case whether based on Contract,
tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise and whether by piercing the corporate veil, by a
claim by or on behalf of a party hereto or another Person or otherwise.
