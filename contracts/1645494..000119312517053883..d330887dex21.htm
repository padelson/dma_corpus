(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Closing, Seller shall cause (i) the Company to sell, transfer, convey
and deliver to Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee, and Purchaser or a Purchaser
Designee shall purchase and accept from the Company, the Purchased Ruckus
Interests, free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Liens and (ii)
each Asset Seller to sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Purchaser
or one or more Purchaser Designees, and Purchaser or one or more Purchaser
Designees shall purchase, acquire and accept from each Asset Seller all of
such Asset Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Purchased Assets
owned, leased, licensed or possessed by such Asset Seller, free and clear of
all Liens other than Permitted Liens.

 

(b) As consideration for the transactions contemplated hereby, Purchaser
shall, or shall cause one or more Purchaser Designees to, (i) pay to Seller
(and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates designated by Seller)
the Closing Date Payment, as adjusted, if applicable, pursuant to Section
2.2(d) (as so adjusted, the " _Purchase Price_ "), and (ii) accept and assume
from the Asset Sellers, and thereafter pay, perform and discharge when due,
the Assumed Liabilities.

2.2 Working Capital Adjustment.

(a) _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_. Seller shall provide to Purchaser
at least five Business Days prior to the Closing Date written notice of
Sellers good faith estimate of the Closing Net Working Capital (such estimate
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Estimated Closing Net Working Capital_
") and shall provide Purchaser with reasonable supporting documentation used
in the preparation of the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital; provided,
however, that (i) in the event that Purchaser notifies Seller, no later than
two Business Days following the delivery of such notice, that it disputes the
Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, Seller and Purchaser shall cooperate in
good faith to resolve any such dispute as promptly as practicable; (ii) if,
prior to the fourth Business Day following delivery of such notice, Seller
and Purchaser agree in writing to any changes to the Estimated Closing Net
Working Capital, then the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital shall be
modified as so agreed; and (iii) if Seller and Purchaser are unable, prior to
the fourth Business Day following delivery of such notice to agree on the
calculation of Estimated Closing Net Working Capital, then the Estimated
Closing Net Working Capital delivered by Seller pursuant to this Section
2.2(a) shall control with respect thereto, subject to any modifications to
which Seller and Purchaser have agreed in writing.

 



23 (b) _Calculation_. Not later than 90 days following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause to be delivered a schedule setting forth the Closing
Net Working Capital (the " _Closing Date Schedule_ "). Purchaser shall prepare
the Closing Date Schedule in accordance with the definitions herein and shall
provide Seller with reasonable supporting documentation used in the
preparation of the Closing Date Schedule.

(c) _Review; Disputes_.

 

(i) From and after the Closing Date, each of Purchaser and Seller shall
provide one another and their respective accountants and advisors
with reasonable access during normal business hours and upon prior notice to
the appropriate books and records of the other Party for the purposes of: (A)
enabling Purchaser and its accountants and advisors to calculate the Closing
Net Working Capital; (B) enabling Seller to review Purchasers calculation of
the Closing Net Working Capital; and (C) identifying and resolving any dispute
related to the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital.

 

(ii) If Seller disputes the calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital set
forth in the Closing Date Schedule, then Seller shall deliver a written
notice (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") to Purchaser during the 45-day period
commencing upon receipt by Seller of the Closing Date Schedule (the " _Review
Period_ "). The Dispute Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the
principal basis for the dispute for each disputed item of such calculation
(including Sellers calculation of the disputed item) and shall be accompanied
by relevant supporting materials.

 

(iii) If Seller does not deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, Purchasers calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital set forth in the Closing Date Schedule shall be deemed final
and binding on Seller and Purchaser for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(iv) If Seller delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser prior to the expiration
of the Review Period, then Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to reach agreement on the Closing Net Working Capital. Any
item set forth on the Closing Net Working Capital that is not objected to in a
Dispute Notice shall be deemed acceptable and shall be final and binding
upon Purchaser and Seller upon delivery of the Dispute Notice. If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to reach agreement on the Closing Net Working Capital
within 30 days after the delivery of the Dispute Notice, either Party shall
have the right to refer such dispute to BDO Seidman LLP or any nationally
recognized independent public accounting firm as shall be otherwise mutually
agreed upon by the Parties (such firm, or any successor thereto, being
referred to herein as the " _Designated Accounting Firm_ ") after such 30th
day. In connection with the resolution of any such dispute by the Designated
Accounting Firm: (i) each of Seller and Purchaser shall have a reasonable
opportunity to meet with the Designated Accounting Firm to provide their
views as to any disputed issues with respect to the calculation of the Closing
Net Working Capital; (ii) the Designated Accounting Firm shall determine the

 



24  Closing Net Working Capital in accordance with the definitions hereof within
30 days of such referral and upon reaching such determination shall deliver a
copy of its calculations (the " _Expert Calculations_ ") to Seller and
Purchaser; and (iii) the determination of the Closing Net Working Capital made
by the Designated Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on Seller and
Purchaser for all purposes of this Agreement, absent manifest error. In
calculating the Closing Net Working Capital, (A) the Designated Accounting
Firm shall be limited to addressing only those particular disputed items
referred to in the Dispute Notice, and (B) such calculation shall, with
respect to any disputed item, be no greater than the higher amount calculated
by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, and no lower than the amount
calculated by Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be. The
Expert Calculations shall reflect in detail the differences, if any, between
the Closing Net Working Capital reflected therein and the Closing Net Working
Capital set forth in the Closing Date Schedule. The fees and expenses of the
Designated Accounting Firm shall be borne by Seller and Purchaser in inverse
proportion as they may prevail on the matters resolved by the Designated
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocation shall be calculated on an
aggregate basis based on the relative dollar values of the amounts in dispute
and shall be determined by the Designated Accounting Firm at the time the
determination is rendered on the merits of the matters submitted to the
Designated Accounting Firm.

 

(d) _Adjustment of Purchase Price_.

 

(i) If the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance
with this Section 2.2, exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital by
more than $250,000, then Purchaser shall, no later than one Business Day after
such determination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company or the applicable
Asset Seller, as determined by Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds an aggregate amount equal to the full amount by
which the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance
with this Section 2.2, exceeds the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital.

 

(ii) If the Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance
with this Section 2.2, is less than the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital
by an amount in excess of $250,000, then Seller shall, no later than one
Business Day after such determination, pay or cause the Company or the
applicable Asset Seller, as determined by the Seller, to pay to Purchaser by
wire transfer of immediately available funds an aggregate amount equal to the
full amount by which the Estimated Closing Net Working Capital exceeds the
Closing Net Working Capital, as finally determined in accordance with this
Section 2.2.

Article VII, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by Section 2.1

Asset for purposes of this Agreement and shall instead be transferred and
assigned hereunder notwithstanding the absence of such Third Party consent or
Governmental Authority consent or any right of a Third Party to cancel such
Purchased Asset. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, in the event any
requisite consent

 



27  cannot be or is not for any reason obtained prior to the Closing, from and
after the Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a
mutually agreeable arrangement (including by way of amendment or addition of
services to the Transition Services Agreement) under which (i) Purchaser or a
Purchaser Designee would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations under
such Nonassignable Assets in accordance with this Agreement, including by sub-
contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to Purchaser or a Purchaser
Designee and/or (ii) such Nonassignable Assets would be held, as of and from
the Closing Date, by Seller or its applicable Subsidiary in trust for
Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee and the covenants and obligations thereunder
would be performed by Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee in Sellers or
such Subsidiarys name and all benefits, obligations and liabilities existing
thereunder would be for Purchasers or a Purchaser Designees account. If
after the Closing Date any Nonassignable Asset becomes assignable (either
because consent for the assignment or execution thereof is obtained or
otherwise), Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser and reasonably cooperate to
assign or transfer such previously Nonassignable Asset to Purchaser or the
applicable Purchaser Designee without payment of any further consideration
therefor.

(c) Purchaser and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
to, use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, or to
cause to be obtained, any consent, substitution, approval, or amendment
required to transfer all rights and obligations under any and all Transferred
Contracts, Governmental Authorizations, certificates, approvals,
authorizations or other rights or obligations or liabilities that constitute
Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities or that are required to perform the

and receive all the benefits of Seller or its Subsidiaries under
the Nonassignable Assets.

2.7 Purchaser Designees; Business Transfer Agreements.

 

(a) The Parties agree that Purchaser may assign the right to purchase certain
Purchased Assets to one or more Purchaser Designees. Notwithstanding any such
assignment, Purchaser shall remain liable for, and any assignment or execution
of any Transaction Document shall not relieve Purchaser of, its obligations
hereunder or thereunder. Any reference to Purchaser in this Agreement shall
to the extent applicable also be deemed a reference to the applicable
Purchaser Designee, except where in context of this Agreement such use would
not be appropriate.

 

(b) The transactions relating to the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets
located in China (the " _China Purchased Assets_ ") and India (the " _India
Purchased Assets_ ") will be concluded under a separate China Purchase
Agreement and India Purchase Agreement between the applicable Asset Seller and
the applicable Purchaser Designee. All consideration with regard to the China
Purchased Assets and the India Purchased Assets will be paid in China and
India as a domestic transaction. No consideration in relation to the purchase
and sale of the China Purchased Assets and the India Purchased Assets will
be paid by the applicable Purchaser Designee to any Asset Seller outside of
China and India, as applicable.

 



28 (c) Except for the Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities of Asset Sellers
formed or incorporated in the United States or as otherwise provided in
Section 2.7(b) or this Section 2.7(c), the transfer of the Purchased Assets
and Assumed Liabilities will be effected at the Closing pursuant to short-form
business and asset transfer agreements entered into between the applicable
Asset Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser or the applicable Purchaser
Designee, on the other hand, each in substantially the form attached as
_Exhibit A_ with such modifications as are necessary in order to maintain
substantially the same legal meaning and effect under local Law as provided in
this Agreement and agreed upon by the Parties (the " _Business Transfer
Agreements_ "), provided that if such Purchased Assets or Assumed Liabilities
of any such Asset Seller are of a type or nature that are not transferable
under local Law or custom pursuant to a Business Transfer Agreement, or if a
Business Transfer Agreement is not sufficient under local Law or custom
to transfer to Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee such applicable Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities, the transfer of such Purchased Assets and
Assumed Liabilities shall be effected or further substantiated, as applicable,
pursuant to the Other Transfer Documents. The transfer of the Purchased
Assets and Assumed Liabilities of the Asset Sellers formed or incorporated in
the United States will be effected pursuant to an assignment, assumption and
bill of sale in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit A_ (the "
_General Assignment and Assumption Agreement_ ").

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any China Purchase Agreement,
India Purchase Agreement, Business Transfer Agreement or Other Transfer
Document, any consideration paid by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to any
Asset Seller pursuant to such agreements or documents shall be deemed for all
purposes to comprise part of, and not be in addition to, the Purchase Price
payable hereunder.

2.8 Allocation of Purchase Price. The initial allocation of the Purchase
Price (the " _Closing Date Allocation_ ") among (i) the Purchased Ruckus
Interests and (ii) the Purchased Assets being sold by each particular Asset
Seller shall be prepared jointly by Seller and Purchaser prior to the Closing
Date. Seller and Purchaser agree to cooperate with each other in the
preparation of, and to negotiate in good faith to resolve any dispute with
respect to, the Closing Date Allocation; provided, however, that in the event
that Seller and Purchaser cannot reach agreement with respect to the Closing
Date Allocation within 30 days prior to the Closing Date, the Designated
Accounting Firm with recognized valuation expertise mutually agreed upon by
Purchaser and Seller shall prepare the Closing Date Allocation. The costs
related to having the Designated Accounting Firm prepare the Closing Date
Allocation shall be borne equally by Purchaser and Seller. Not later than 90
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller an
allocation of all amounts treated as purchase price for U.S. federal income
tax purposes among the Purchased Ruckus Interests and the Purchased Assets
consistent with applicable Law (the " _Asset Level Allocation Statement_ ").
The Asset Level Allocation Statement shall be consistent with the Closing Date
Allocation. Seller and Purchaser shall work in good faith to resolve any
disputes relating to the Asset Level Allocation Statement. If Seller and
Purchaser are unable to resolve any such dispute, such dispute shall be
resolved promptly by the Designated Accounting Firm as shall be mutually
agreed upon by the Parties, the costs of which shall be borne equally by
Purchaser and Seller. The Parties agree that they will not,

 



29  and will not permit any of their respective Affiliates to, take a position
(except as required pursuant to any Order of, or to settle a dispute with, a
Governmental Authority) on any Tax Return or in any audit or examination
before any Governmental Authority that is inconsistent with the final Asset
Level Allocation Statement (the final Asset Level Allocation Statement being
referred to herein as the " _Allocation_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing in this Section 2.8 shall prevent the Parties or their respective
Affiliates from settling, or require any of them to litigate, any challenge,
proposed deficiency, adjustment or other similar Proceeding by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Allocation. Each of Purchaser and
Seller shall promptly notify the other in writing upon receipt of notice of
any pending or threatened Tax audits, assessments or other
proceedings challenging the Allocation. If the Purchase Price is adjusted
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Allocation shall be adjusted in a
manner consistent with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.8.

 

2.9 Withholding.

 

(a) Purchaser, Seller and any of their respective Affiliates shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted and withheld, from amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, any amounts as are required to
be withheld or deducted with respect to such amounts under the Code, or any
applicable provisions of state, local or non-U.S. law. Each Party shall
provide commercially reasonable notice to the other Party upon becoming aware
of any such withholding obligation and shall cooperate with such other Party
to the extent reasonable to obtain reduction of or relief from such
withholding or deduction. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
timely remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. The Party making any such deduction or withholding shall furnish to the
other Party official receipts (or copies thereof or, if official receipts are
not available, other documentation reasonably satisfactory to the Party
in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made) evidencing the
payment of any such amounts. Any refunds of amounts withheld or deducted under
this Section 2.9 shall be for the account of the Party in respect of which
such deduction or withholding was made. If Purchaser assigns its rights under
Section 2.7 in a manner that results in any additional withholding or
deduction from any payment of the Purchase Price, which would not have
resulted absent such assignment (an " _Incremental Withholding_ "), the
Purchase Price shall be increased in an amount necessary so that after such
Incremental Withholding has been made (including such withholdings and
deductions applicable to additional sums under this Section 2.9) the
recipient receives an amount equal to the Purchase Price it would have
received had no such Incremental Withholding been made.

 

(b) Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that (i) Seller will be
responsible for and will perform (A) all required Tax withholding, payment
and reporting duties with respect to any wages and other compensation paid by
Seller or its Subsidiaries to any Business Employee in connection with the
operation or conduct of the Business for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) any
Tax withholding, payment and reporting related to payments made by Seller or
its Subsidiaries to any Transferred Employee under a Benefit Plan of Seller or
its Subsidiaries with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period, (C) any
Tax withholding, payment and reporting related to payments made by Seller or
its Subsidiaries under a Transferred Benefit Plan with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, and (D) any Tax withholding, payment and reporting

 



30  related to any change-of-control, retention, severance, vacation or paid
time off or similar payment that is triggered in whole or in part by the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement, and (ii)
Purchaser will be responsible for and will perform all required Tax
withholding, payment and reporting duties with respect to (A) any wages and
other compensation paid by Purchaser or a Purchaser Designee to
any Transferred Employee with respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period and (B)
any payments made or benefits provided by Purchaser to any Transferred
Employee under a Transferred Benefit Plan with respect to any Post-Closing Tax
Period. After the Closing, Purchaser and Seller agree to use the alternate
procedure set forth in Rev. Proc. 2004-53 with respect to the Transferred
Employees. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this paragraph is intended
to modify or adjust the substantive liability of Purchaser and Seller under
this Agreement with respect to the Taxes described in this paragraph.

2.10 Pre-Closing Transfers.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including
Section 5.1), at any time prior to the Closing, Seller, the Company and their
respective Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) shall be
permitted to (i) engage in dividends, sweeps and other transfers of cash, cash

any Assumed Leases) of the Transferred Subsidiaries and (ii) assign, transfer,
convey or deliver to Seller or any of its Affiliates any accounts receivable,
vendor rebate receivables, notes receivable or other receivables due to any
Transferred Subsidiary.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Excluded Litigation Liabilities of the
Transferred Subsidiaries and the Retained Ruckus Liabilities shall be assumed
by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) and
shall be paid, performed and discharged when due by Seller of such Affiliate
after the Closing.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, (i) Seller shall cause each of Brocade Communication

deliver to Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries) any and all of their respective assets, properties, business
and rights that are not primarily related to or primarily used in the
operation or conduct of the Business, and (ii) the Liabilities of each Brocade
Communication Systems KK, Brocade Israel Ltd., Brocade Communications
Singapore Pte. Ltd. and Brocade Communications Systems Taiwan Ltd. that are
not arising primarily out of or otherwise primarily related to the Business
shall be assumed by Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Subsidiaries) and shall be paid, performed and discharged when due by Seller

with Sellers consent to the taking of such Restricted Action (to the extent
primarily relating to the Business) unless Seller has received Purchasers
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to
the taking of such Restricted Action or Sellers failure to provide the
Company with such consent would be deemed to be an unreasonable withholding,
conditioning or delaying of such consent pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 hereof, except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall, in each case, to the

Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 hereof, Seller shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries not to take any of the following actions with
respect to the Business, any of the Transferred Subsidiaries or the Purchased
Assets:

connection with their own Taxes or the Taxes of any consolidated, combined,
unitary or other Tax group that includes both (A) the Transferred Subsidiaries

with respect to a Transferred Subsidiary included in such consolidated,
combined, unitary or other Tax group;

 

(k) institute, settle or offer or agree to settle any Proceeding relating to

(p) agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

From the Merger Effective Time until the earlier of the Closing Date or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1 hereof, Seller
shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to, issue, deliver or
sell, or authorize the issuance, delivery or sale of, any Ultimate Parent
Option or Ultimate Parent RSU Award to any Business Employee.

 

5.2 Investigation of Business; Confidentiality.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, from the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Merger Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1 hereof, to the extent reasonably requested by
Purchaser, Seller shall request that the Company permit Purchaser to conduct
(and cooperate with Purchasers) customary due diligence investigations with
respect to the Business and furnish information regarding the Business to
Purchaser, subject in all cases to the limitations and terms and conditions of
Section 6.08 of the Merger Agreement applicable to such due diligence
investigations and the provision of such information. To the extent that
Seller makes a request to the Company pursuant to this Section 5.2(a) and uses
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce its rights under the Merger
Agreement, in no event shall the Companys failure to comply with such
request be deemed to be a breach of Sellers obligations under this Agreement.

(b) Subject to applicable Law, from the Merger Effective Time until the
earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 7.1, Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, permit
Purchaser and its Representatives to have reasonable access during normal
business hours to the properties, books, records, Contracts and such financial
information (including working papers) and operating data of the Business and
the Business Employees as Purchaser may reasonably request to review
information and documentation, and the opportunity to ask questions relative
to the properties, books, contracts, commitments and other records of the
Business and to conduct any other reasonable investigations; provided, that
such investigation shall only be upon reasonable notice and shall not
unreasonably disrupt the personnel and operations of Seller, the Company and
their respective Subsidiaries. All requests for access to the offices,
properties, books and records of the Business shall be made to such
Representatives of Seller as Seller shall designate, who shall be solely
responsible for coordinating all such requests and all access permitted
hereunder. It is further agreed that neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates or Representatives shall contact any of the employees,
customers (including dealers and distributors), suppliers or joint venture
partners of Seller, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether in person or by telephone,
electronic or other mail or other means of communication, without the specific
prior authorization of such Representatives of Seller. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
provide access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure
would waive the attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or Contract to
which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. The Parties shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under the circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply.

 



56 (c) The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and its
terms and all information, whether written or oral, furnished by either Party
to the other Party or any Subsidiary or representative of such other Party in
connection with this Agreement shall be treated as "Evaluation Material" under
the Confidentiality Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
effective upon the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate and
be of no further force and effect.

 

5.3 Necessary Efforts.

 

(a) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to: (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate actions and do, or cause to be
done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties hereto and their
respective Affiliates in doing all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable; (ii)
obtain from any Governmental Authority any consents, licenses, permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained by Seller
or Purchaser or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or to avoid any
Proceeding by any Governmental Authority, in connection with the
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated herein; and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within 20 Business Days after the date hereof
with respect to the HSR Act), make all necessary registrations, declarations,
submissions and filings, and thereafter make any other
required registrations, declarations, submissions and filings, and pay any
fees due in connection therewith, with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement required under the Exchange Act,
any other applicable federal or state securities laws, the HSR Act, any
applicable Competition Laws, and any other applicable Law; provided, that the
Parties shall cooperate with each other in connection with (x) determining
whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (y) seeking any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers or making any such filings. The Parties shall furnish to
each other all information required for any application or other filing under
the rules and regulations of any applicable Law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As promptly as practicable after
the execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall prepare, prefile, and then
and as promptly as practicable thereafter, but in no event earlier than five
Business Days thereafter, file with CFIUS a joint voluntary notice pursuant to
Exon-Florio with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Each Party shall provide CFIUS with any additional or supplemental information
requested by CFIUS or its member agencies during the Exon-Florio review
process as promptly as practicable, and in all cases within the amount of
time allowed by CFIUS. Subject to applicable Law, the Parties will consult and
cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party relating to proceedings under Exon-
Florio. The Parties, in cooperation with each other, shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to finally and successfully obtain the
CFIUS Clearance as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, nothing in this Section 5.3(a) shall require or obligate (i)
Seller or any of its Affiliates to take any action

 



57  pursuant to the Merger Agreement or with respect to or in connection with
the transactions contemplated thereby, (ii) either Party to perform, satisfy
or discharge any obligations of any other Party under this Agreement or
otherwise or (iii) Seller or any of its Affiliates to expend any money other
than for filing fees or expenses or reasonable and customary costs or expenses
or agree to any restriction in order to obtain any consents.

(b) In connection with the efforts referenced in Section 5.3(a), the Parties
shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use
their reasonable best efforts and take all actions necessary to (i) respond as
promptly as practicable to any requests for information from any Governmental
Authority, and to avoid and/or overcome any action, including any
legislative, administrative or judicial action, and (ii) have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any judgment, injunction or other Order (whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent) that restricts, prevents or prohibits,
or could restrict, prevent or prohibit, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries be required or expected to retain any of the
Purchased Assets or any assets of the Transferred Subsidiaries (including
assets that would be Purchased Assets but for the inability to obtain a
consent) in order to comply with its obligations in respect of the foregoing.
Each Party shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation of any necessary filings or submissions by it to any Governmental
Authority. Except as prohibited or restricted by Law or any Competition Laws,
each Party or its attorneys shall provide the other Party or its attorneys
with copies of all correspondence, filings or communications (or memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) which are made after the filing of the
Hart Scott Rodino Notification and Report Form between such Party or its
representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority, on the other
hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, subject to redaction or other
similar approach (including sharing on an outside counsel only basis) as
reasonably necessary of documents filed pursuant to Item 4(c) of the Hart
Scott Rodino Notification and Report Form. Without in any way limiting the
foregoing, the Parties shall consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party in connection
with Proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or any other Competition
Law. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Authority or
by applicable Law, in connection with any request, inquiry, investigation,
action or legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Party will
permit authorized Representatives of the other Party to be present at each
meeting, conference or telephone call relating to such request, inquiry,
investigation, action or legal proceeding and to have access to and be
consulted in connection with any document, opinion, proposal or other
communication made or submitted to any Governmental Authority in connection
with such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with the receipt of any necessary approvals or clearances of a Governmental
Authority in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
neither Seller nor Purchaser (nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates) shall be required to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of
or conduct their business in a specified manner, or agree to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct their businesses in a specified
manner, or enter into or agree to enter into a voting trust arrangement, proxy
arrangement, "hold separate" agreement or arrangement or similar agreement or
arrangement with respect to the assets, operations or

 



58  conduct of their business in a specified manner, or permit the sale, holding
separate or other disposition of, any assets of Purchaser, the Company, Seller
or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates; provided, however, that,
Purchaser agrees that if necessary to receive (i) the necessary approvals or
clearances of a Governmental Authority required under the HSR Act or any
applicable Competition Laws, Purchaser will (and will cause its Affiliates,
including the Transferred Subsidiaries, to) take, commit to take or cause to
be taken, such actions that would not reduce the reasonably anticipated
benefits to Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
an amount that is financially material relative to the value of the Purchased
Assets and the Transferred Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) CFIUS
Clearance or the necessary approvals or clearances of the Defense Security
Service or other U.S. national security agencies, Purchaser will (and will
cause its Affiliates, including the Transferred Subsidiaries, to) enter into
or agree to enter into a voting trust, proxy, special security, "hold
separate" or similar agreement or arrangement, in each case, that is
customary in form and substance, with respect to the Purchased Assets or the
assets, operations or conduct of the business of the Transferred Subsidiaries,
so long as the assets subject to such agreement or arrangement account for
less than $35,000,000 in annual aggregate revenue (measured by the fiscal year
2016 revenue of the Business).

 

5.4 Public Disclosures. Unless otherwise required by Law, the rules and
regulations of any stock exchange or quotation services on which such Partys
stock is traded or quoted, prior to the Closing Date, no news release or other
public announcement pertaining to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will be made by or on behalf of either Party or its
Subsidiaries without the prior written approval of the other Party (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If in
the judgment of either Party such a news release or public announcement is
required by Law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange on which
such Partys stock is traded, the Party intending to make such release or
announcement shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide prior
written notice to the other Party of the contents of such release or
announcement and to allow the other Party reasonable time to comment on such
release or announcement in advance of such issuance.

 

5.5 Access to Records and Personnel.

 

(a) From and after the Closing until the third anniversary of the Closing,
each Party shall provide, or cause to be provided, to each other, as soon as
reasonably practicable after written request therefor and at the requesting
Partys sole expense, reasonable access (including using commercially
reasonable efforts to give access to Third Parties possessing information),
during normal business hours, to the other Partys Representatives and to any
books, records, documents, files and correspondence in the possession or under
the control of the other Party that the requesting Party reasonably needs (i)
to comply with reporting, disclosure, filing or other requirements imposed on
the requesting Party (including under applicable securities Laws) by a
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the requesting Party in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) for use in any
other judicial, regulatory, administrative or other Proceeding or in order to
satisfy audit, accounting, claims, regulatory, litigation or other similar
requirements arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(iii) for use

 



59  in any Proceeding relating to the infringement of the Intellectual Property
Rights of another Person, or (iv) to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement; provided, however, that no Party shall be required to provide
access to or disclose information where such access or disclosure (y) is
related to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Article VIII or any other
claim against a Party or such Partys Affiliates or (z) would violate any Law
or agreement, or waive any attorney-client or other similar privilege, and
each Party may redact information regarding itself or its Affiliates or
otherwise not relating to the other Party and its Affiliates, and, in the
event such provision of information could reasonably be expected to violate
any Law or agreement or waive any attorney-client or other similar privilege,
the Parties shall take all commercially reasonable measures to permit the
compliance with such obligations in a manner that avoids any such harm or
consequence.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, any information owned by
a Party that is provided to a requesting Party or its Representatives pursuant
to this Section 5.5 shall be deemed to remain the property of the providing
Party. Unless specifically set forth herein, nothing contained in this
Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring rights of license or
otherwise in any such information.

(c) No Party shall have any liability to any other Party in the event that
any information exchanged or provided pursuant to this Section 5.5 is found to
be inaccurate.

 

(d) From and after the Closing until the fifth anniversary thereof, unless
otherwise required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock exchange
or quotation services on which such Partys stock is traded or quoted, each
Party shall hold confidentially, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to hold confidentially, all information furnished or made
available by a Party (the " _Provider_ ") to the other Party (the "
_Receiver_ ") or its Representatives pursuant to this Section 5.5 and the
terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and Seller shall
hold confidential, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to hold
confidential all information regarding the Business (all such information
being referred to as " _Confidential Information_ "). The Parties shall, and
shall cause their Representatives to, use the Confidential Information only
in connection with the performance of this Agreement or as otherwise
contemplated hereby. " _Confidential Information_ " furnished or made
available pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall not include information which
(i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of
a disclosure by the Receiver or its Representatives in violation of this
Agreement; (ii) becomes available to the Receiver or its Representatives on a
nonconfidential basis from a Person other than the Provider or its Affiliates
or Representatives who is not known by the Receiver to be bound by a
confidentiality agreement with the Provider or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives, or is not known by the Receiver to be under an obligation to
the Provider or any of its Affiliates or Representatives not to transmit the
information to the Receiver; (iii) was in the possession of the
Receiver prior to disclosure by the Provider or its Representatives
(provided, that any information regarding the Business in the possession of
Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date or provided to Seller or
its Affiliates pursuant to, or maintained by Seller or its Affiliates under,
the Transition Services Agreement shall not be subject to this provision); or
(iv) is developed by the Receiver independent of any Confidential Information
provided hereunder (provided, that any information regarding the Business in
the possession of Seller or its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date or
provided to Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to, or maintained by Seller or
its Affiliates under, the

 



60  Transition Services Agreement shall not be subject to this provision).
Nothing in this Section 5.5 shall affect Purchasers rights in the Purchased
Assets following the Closing. In the event that the Receiver or any of its
Representatives are required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock
exchange or quotation services on which such Partys stock is traded or quoted
to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiver shall provide the
Provider with prompt notice of such request or requirement in order to enable
the Provider to: (i) seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy;
(ii) consult with the Receiver with respect to the Providers taking steps to
resist or narrow the scope of such request or legal process; or (iii) waive
compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this Section 5.5(d). In the
event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the
Provider waives compliance, in whole or in part, with the terms of this
Section 5.5(d), the Receiver or its Representative, as the case may be, shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to disclose only that portion of
the Confidential Information that the Receiver is advised in writing by its
legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed and to ensure that all
Confidential Information that is so disclosed will be accorded confidential
treatment.

 

(e) Nothing in this Section 5.5 shall require either Party to violate any
agreement with any Third Parties regarding the confidentiality of
confidential and proprietary information or of customer information; provided,
however, that in the event that either Party is required under this Section
5.5 to disclose any such information, that Party shall provide notice of the
basis for any such potential violation and use commercially reasonable
efforts to seek to obtain such Third Partys consent to the disclosure of such
information and implement requisite procedures to enable the disclosure of
such information.

 

5.6 Ultimate Parent Options and Ultimate Parent RSU Awards.

 

(a) Seller shall cause each outstanding and unvested Ultimate Parent Option
held by a Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing to be
vested in full and cancelled immediately prior the Closing, and Seller shall
pay (or cause to be paid to) such Transferred Employee an amount in cash equal
to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of Ultimate
Parent Ordinary Shares that were issuable upon exercise of such Ultimate
Parent Option as of immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) the amount, if
any, by which (A) the Applicable Award Cash Out Price for such Ultimate
Parent Option exceeds (B) the exercise price per Ultimate Parent Ordinary
Share at which such Ultimate Parent Option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Closing, without interest and subject to applicable tax withholdings.
Seller shall cause such payments to be made through the payroll systems of
Seller or its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , to the extent that such
payments are made through the payroll systems of any Transferred Subsidiary,
such payments (and any related withholding payments) shall be made prior to
the Closing.

(b) Seller shall cause each outstanding and unvested Ultimate Parent RSU
Award held by a Transferred Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing
to be vested in full and cancelled immediately prior the Closing, and Seller
shall pay (or cause to be paid to) such Transferred Employee an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the aggregate number of
Ultimate Parent Ordinary Shares that were issuable with regard to the related
Ultimate Parent RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) the
Applicable Award Cash Out Price for such Ultimate Parent RSU Award, without
interest and

 



61  subject to applicable tax withholdings. Seller shall cause such payments to
be made through the payroll systems of Seller or its Subsidiaries; provided,
however, to the extent that such payments are made through the payroll
systems of any Transferred Subsidiary, such payments (and any related
withholding payments) shall be made prior to the Closing.

 

(c) As soon as reasonably practicable and prior to the Closing Date, Seller
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, adopt such resolutions and take
such other action as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate the provisions
of this Section 5.6 (including using reasonable best efforts to request the
consent of each holder of Ultimate Parent Options and Ultimate Parent RSU
Awards that may be necessary so that the Applicable Award Cash Out Price for
such Ultimate Parent Options and Ultimate Parent RSU Awards will equal the
Merger Exchange Price).

 

(d) The Closing Date Payment shall be increased by an amount (such amount, the
" _Aggregate Award Cash Out Amount_ ") equal to (i) the aggregate amount of
the total payments required to be made (or caused to be made) by Seller or its
Affiliates pursuant to this Section 5.6 (including the employer portion of any
payroll withholding or similar Taxes in connection therewith), _minus_ (ii)
any cash Tax savings or refunds that are actually realized by Seller or any of
its Affiliates in the Tax year of such payments or are reasonably anticipated
to be realized in the two immediately succeeding Tax years, and any amounts
reasonably anticipated to be credited against cash Taxes payable of Seller or
any of its Affiliates in the Tax year of such payments or the two immediately
succeeding Tax years.

 

5.7 Employee Relations and Benefits.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided with respect to (i) those Transferred
Subsidiary Employees whose employment will continue after the Closing Date as
described in Section 5.7(l) and (ii) Non-U.S. Employees whose employment will
continue after the Closing Date as described in Section 5.7(j), Purchaser
shall offer employment within 15 days prior to the Closing Date to each
Business Employee to be effective on the Closing Date (except for those
Business Employees on vacation or other approved leave of absence as of the
Closing Date, which offer is to be effective on their return to employment),
each such offer to be, for at least 12 months after the Closing Date (subject
to the penultimate sentence of this Section 5.7(a)), at (A) the same general
location as in effect immediately prior to the Closing and the same or
superior base salary or base wage rate as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing, and (B) cash bonus opportunities no less favorable in the aggregate
as those provided to such employees by Seller or its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing (unless otherwise required by local Law, in which case
such offer shall comply with local Law). Those Business Employees who accept
the offer of employment from Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries and who
commence employment with Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries immediately
after the Closing Date (or, for those on vacation or other approved leave of
absence with a legal right to return to employment, immediately after
expiration of their leave), as well as any Transferred Subsidiary Employees
whose employment will continue after the Closing Date as described in Section
5.7(l) and any Non-U.S. Employees whose employment will continue after the
Closing Date as described in Section 5.7(j) shall be referred to herein as "
_Transferred Employees_." Nothing herein shall limit Purchasers ability to
terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee employed by Purchaser or
the Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing. If any Transferred Employee

 



62  requires a work visa or permit or an employment pass or other approval for
his or her employment to continue with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates as
of or after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to secure prior to the
Closing Date the necessary visa, permit, pass or other approval in a timely
manner consistent with the terms of this Section 5.7, if and only if Seller
provides in advance of Closing and in a timely manner (and no less than 30
days before Closing) all information as is necessary to secure such necessary
visa, permit, pass or other approval in a timely manner, and Purchaser shall
be solely responsible for any expenses related thereto.

(b) Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to,
engage in any activity intended to discourage any Business Employee from
accepting an offer of employment from Purchaser and/or one of its Affiliates,
and Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to,
offer employment with any business of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date; provided,
however, that Seller and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to take any
action (i) they are legally required to take in order to comply with local
Laws or (ii) as mutually agreed by the Parties.

(c) Starting on the Closing Date and ending on the first anniversary of the
Closing Date or any longer period as required under local employment Laws,
each Transferred Employee who remains employed by Purchaser and/or one of its
Subsidiaries shall be allowed to participate in employee benefit
plans, agreements, programs, policies and arrangements of Purchaser and/or
one of its Subsidiaries that provide 401(k), medical, dental, vision, long-
term disability, long-term care, tuition assistance, business travel accident
and employee recognition benefits (the " _Purchaser Plans_ ") that are no
less favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of
Purchaser and/or one of its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Seller shall retain responsibility for and continue to pay all medical,
life insurance, disability and other welfare plan expenses and benefits for
each Business Employee with respect to claims incurred by such Business
Employees or their covered dependents prior to the Closing Date (and, for
those Business Employees who are not employed by a Transferred Subsidiary but
are on an approved leave of absence as of the Closing Date, prior to their
return to employment). Expenses and benefits with respect to claims incurred
by Transferred Employees or their covered dependents under Purchaser Plans or
any Transferred Benefit Plan on or after the Closing Date shall be the
responsibility of Purchaser. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim is deemed
incurred: in the case of medical or dental benefits, when the services that
are the subject of the claim are performed; in the case of life insurance,
when the death occurs; in the case of disability benefits, when the disability
occurs; in the case of workers compensation benefits, when the event giving
rise to the benefits occurs; and otherwise, at the time the Transferred
Employee or covered dependent becomes entitled to payment of a benefit
(assuming that all procedural requirements are satisfied and claims
applications properly and timely completed and submitted).

 

(e) With respect to any plan that is a group health plan maintained by
Purchaser or its Subsidiaries and provided to Transferred Employees after the
Closing, Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause its Subsidiaries to, with
respect to Transferred Employees, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cause to be waived any pre-existing condition and waiting periods, except
to the extent such provisions were applicable under the similar Benefit Plan
as of

 



63  the Closing Date (or, for those Business Employees who are not employed by a
Transferred Subsidiary but are on vacation or other approved leave of absence
as of the Closing Date, on their return to employment) and (ii) give effect,
in determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to
amounts paid by such Transferred Employees during the plan year of the
applicable group health plan sponsored by Seller or one of its Subsidiaries
during which the Closing (or, for those Business Employees who are not
employed by a Transferred Subsidiary but are on vacation or other approved
leave of absence as of the Closing Date, their return to employment) occurs.
Seller shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide all necessary
information on a timely basis that Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall
require to verify that such deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations
have been paid by such Transferred Employees, and Purchasers and its
Subsidiaries duties under this paragraph shall be contingent upon obtaining
such information on a timely basis.

 

(f) For purposes of eligibility and vesting only, Transferred Employees shall
be given credit for all service with Seller, any of its Subsidiaries, and any
predecessor employer for which Seller credited service, under each plan of
Purchaser or its Affiliates in which such Transferred Employees are eligible
to participate (other than equity incentive plans or defined benefit
plans) to the same extent as recognized under any comparable Benefit Plan.

(g) Except as required by applicable Law or as may be agreed to by Seller and
Purchaser, as of the Closing Date (or, for those Business Employees on
vacation or other approved leave of absence as of the Closing Date, as of the
expiration of their leave), the Transferred Employees shall cease to accrue
further benefits under the employee benefit plans and arrangements maintained
by Seller and its Subsidiaries, except for the Transferred Benefit Plans, and
shall commence participation in the Purchaser Plans to the extent permitted
by, and in accordance with, the terms of such Purchaser Plans. Seller shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take all steps necessary to (i) permit
such employees to take distributions of such balances from any 401(k) plan of
Seller and to the extent permitted by Purchasers 401(k) plan, rollover such
balances (including notes associated with plan loans) to Purchasers 401(k)
plan, and (ii) following the Closing Date, prevent any Transferred Employees
plan loans from going into default prior to such rollovers occurring unless
such rollovers do not occur prior to the end of the calendar quarter following
the calendar quarter in which the Closing Date (or, for those Business
Employees on vacation or other approved leave of absence as of the Closing
Date, the expiration of their leave) occurs. Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to permit each such Transferred Employee who has received
an eligible rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the
Code) from a 401(k) plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries to roll such
eligible rollover distribution, including, for a reasonable period of time
following the Closing Date, any associated loans into an account under a
401(k) plan maintained by Purchaser or its Affiliates to the extent permitted
by Purchasers 401(k) plan. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 5.7(g), neither Purchaser nor its Affiliates shall be obligated to
comply with the provisions hereof if Purchaser and/or its Affiliates
reasonably determine that compliance with the provisions of this Section
5.7(g) would negatively impact the tax-qualified status of Purchasers 401(k)
Plan.

 



64 (h) With respect to (i) any accrued but unused vacation, sick and paid time
off of Transferred Employees and (ii) any gratuity payments required to made
to Transferred Employees in India pursuant to the Payment of Gratuity Act,
1972, as amended, as of the Closing Date (or, for those Business Employees on
vacation or other approved leave of absence as of the Closing Date, the
expiration of their leave) to which any Transferred Employee is entitled
pursuant to the policy of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Closing (or, for those Business Employees on vacation or other approved
leave of absence as of the Closing Date, their return to employment), to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, pay each Transferred Employee in full for such accrued but
unused vacation, sick and paid time off and any gratuity payments within 30
days after the Closing (or, for those Business Employees on vacation or other
approved leave of absence as of the Closing Date, 30 days after the expiration
of their leave). Closing Net Working Capital shall be decreased by the
aggregate amount of any accrued but unused vacation, sick and paid time off
and any gratuity payments to which any Transferred Employee is entitled
pursuant to the policy of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior
to the Closing (or, for those Business Employees on vacation or other approved
leave of absence as of the Closing Date, their return to employment) that
cannot be paid in full within 30 days after the Closing (or, for those
Business Employees on vacation or other approved leave of absence as of the
Closing Date, 30 days after the expiration of their leave) in accordance with
applicable Law (such aggregate amount, the " _Aggregate Vacation Cash Out
Liability_ ").

(i) Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Subsidiaries
with respect to any liability under COBRA or similar applicable Laws in the
United States arising from the actions (or inactions) of Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries relating to Transferred Employees after the Closing Date. Seller
shall retain, and indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates
for, all liabilities, including with respect to any "qualifying event" (as
defined under COBRA) occurring on or before the Closing, and liabilities under
similar applicable Laws incurred on or prior to the Closing Date or arising
as a result of the transactions described herein, including without limitation
with respect to all qualifying MandA Beneficiaries under COBRA relating to the
Business.

 

(j) Seller and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that each contract of
employment between a Transferred Subsidiary and a Non-U.S. Employee shall not
terminate upon the Closing to the extent required to remain in effect under
applicable Law, but rather shall continue in full force and effect after the
Closing Date pursuant to applicable Laws and as described in Section 5.7(a),
each such Non-U.S. Employee shall be considered a "Transferred Employee"
hereunder.

(k) In the case of any Benefit Plan that is a Non-U.S. Benefit Plan, Seller
or its Affiliates, as the case may be, shall take any necessary actions to
cause, effective as of the Closing, any Non-U.S. Employees and former
international employees of the Business (and their respective eligible
dependents and beneficiaries) who are participating in any such Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan to cease participation in such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan. Seller
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, comply with all obligations under
applicable Laws to inform or consult, whether individually or collectively,
with Non-U.S. Employees (and obtain any required consent from any such
Non-U.S. Employee) or employee representatives, unions, works councils or
other employee representative bodies, if any, and shall provide such
information to Purchaser as is required for Purchaser to comply with its
obligations on a timely basis. Purchaser and its Affiliates shall assume and
be solely responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless, Seller and
its Affiliates from and against, all obligations, Liabilities, costs and
commitments in

 



65  respect of (i) claims made by any Transferred Employee for (A) any
statutory, contractual or common law severance, termination pay or separation
benefits (including the employer portion of any employment taxes, together
with any compensation payable during any mandatory termination period related
thereto) including, but not limited to, claims for wrongful dismissal,
constructive dismissal, notice of termination of employment, pay in lieu of
notice or termination, termination indemnities or other indemnities, (B) any
damages arising from a breach of such Transferred Employees employment
Contract and (C) any payments required to be made in respect of
the termination of the Transferred Employees employment, in case of (A), (B)
or (C) arising out of, relating to or in connection with the failure of
Purchaser or one of its Affiliates to offer employment to any such Transferred
Employee that complies with the terms of Section 5.7(a) and as required by
applicable Law; (ii) the failure of Purchaser and/or any of its Affiliates to
inform or consult any Business Employees, any Governmental Entity, or any
employee representatives as required by applicable Law in connection with the
foregoing; and (iii) amounts imposed by a Governmental Entity and/or under
applicable Law arising out of any difference between the terms and conditions
of employment applicable to a Transferred Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date and those applicable to that Transferred Employee on and after
the Closing Date (but only to the extent the terms and conditions of
employment applicable to a Transferred Employee prior to the Closing Date
complied with applicable Law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall be
solely responsible for any and all Liabilities arising from or relating to the
termination of employment by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any Business
Employee, including any Non-U.S. Employee, who fails to accept the offer of
employment by Purchaser or one of its Affiliates described in Section 5.7(a).

 

(l) Each Transferred Subsidiary Employee as of the Closing Date shall be
employed by the applicable Transferred Subsidiary immediately following the
Closing Date, and shall be provided with, for at least 12 months after the
Closing Date (subject to the penultimate sentence of Section 5.7(a)), (i) the
same general location of employment as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing and the same or superior base salary or base wage rate as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) cash bonus opportunities no less
favorable in the aggregate as those provided to such employees by Seller or
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Closing (unless otherwise required
by local Law, in which case in compliance with local Law).

(m) Purchaser agrees that it will take, and will cause its Affiliates to
take, all steps reasonably necessary to be in a position to employ (which
shall include, but not be limited to, establishing the appropriate payroll
systems, plans and insurance arrangements to provide the compensation and
benefits described in this Section 5.7) as of the Closing Date all Transferred
Employees (including those Transferred Employees who are Non-U.S. Employees)
as of the Closing Date (or, as of immediately after the expiration of such
leave and their return to employment, for those Business Employees who are not
employed by a Transferred Subsidiary but are on an approved leave of absence
as of the Closing Date) in compliance with applicable Law, any applicable
Contractual requirements and the requirements of this Section 5.7. Purchaser
and Seller agree to provide the other in a timely manner, whether before or
after the Closing Date, with such information and, when appropriate,
documentation, as such Party may reasonably request about the provisions of
this Section 5.7 so that both Purchaser and Seller may fulfill their legal
obligations hereunder, comply with its obligations under this Agreement
and confirm compliance with their obligations under

 



66  applicable Law. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the Parties
will cooperate with respect to the transfer of employee data relating to the
Business Employees as necessary to carry out their obligations set forth in
this Section 5.7 no later than 45 days before the Closing. Seller will
transfer to Purchaser such employee data relating to the Transferred Employees
as required by Purchaser for purposes of this Section 5.7 at least 45 days
before the Closing and as soon as administratively practicable following the
Closing to the extent necessary for the operation of the Business; except that
Seller shall not be required to create records that are not required by law
or usually maintained in such circumstances.

(n) Seller shall be solely responsible for any compensation or other
amounts payable to any Transferred Employee in respect of his or her
employment by the Company or its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Closing
Date (excluding any Liabilities relating to any Transferred Benefit Plan that
exist as of, or arise on or after, the Closing Date under such Transferred
Benefit Plan other than any amounts with respect to which Seller specifically
retains responsibility under this Section 5.7), including, without limitation,
any payroll, bonuses, workers compensation or employee benefits (but
excluding any amount payable under Section 5.7(h)), for any period relating to
service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the
Closing Date, and (i) Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, all such unpaid
amounts to which Transferred Employees who are not employed by a Transferred
Subsidiary are entitled as of the Closing on or prior to the Closing Date (or,
as of immediately after the expiration of such leave and their return to
employment, for those Business Employees who are not employed by a Transferred
Subsidiary but are on an approved leave of absence as of the Closing Date) and
(ii) Closing Net Working Capital shall be decreased by the aggregate amount
of all such unpaid amounts to which Transferred Employees who are employed by
a Transferred Subsidiary are entitled as of the Closing (the " _Aggregate
Transferred Subsidiary Compensation Liability_ ").

 

(o) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 5.7 with respect to employees are included for the sole benefit of
the respective Parties and shall not create any right in any other Person,
including any employees, former employees, Transferred Employees, any
participant in any Benefit Plan or any spouse, dependent or beneficiary
thereof or any right to continued employment with Seller or Purchaser, nor
require Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Purchaser to continue or amend any
particular benefit plan on or after the Closing Date for Transferred
Employees, and any such plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with
its terms and applicable Law.

5.8 Tax Matters.

 

(a) _Transfer Taxes_. Transfer Taxes shall be borne one-half by Purchaser and
one-half by Seller and the Asset Sellers, as applicable. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Transfer Taxes_ " shall mean all transfer, filing,
recordation, _ad valorem_ , sales and use, bulk sales, stamp duties, GST,
value added, excise, license or similar fees or Taxes attributable to the
transactions occurring pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, that any
GST, value added taxes or similar taxes that are creditable or recoverable by
Purchaser (or its assignees that acquire the Purchased Assets) shall be borne
solely by Purchaser (or such assignees). Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate
in timely making all filings, returns, reports and forms as may be required in
connection with the payment of Transfer Taxes. Purchaser or Seller, as
applicable, shall execute and deliver all instruments and certificates
necessary to enable the other to comply with any filing requirements relating
to any such Transfer Taxes. Purchaser and Seller shall take all action
reasonably necessary to cause GST, value added taxes and similar taxes to be
creditable or recoverable by Purchaser (or its assignees that acquire the
Purchased Assets).

 



67 (b) _Straddle Period Allocation_. All Property Taxes levied solely with
respect to the Purchased Assets for the Straddle Period shall be apportioned
between Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller (in the case of the Transferred
Subsidiaries) or the applicable Asset Seller, on the other hand, based on the
number of days of such Straddle Period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period
and the number of days of such Straddle Period included in the Post-Closing
Tax Period. Seller and the Asset Sellers, as applicable, shall be liable for
the proportionate amount of such Property Taxes that is attributable to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Purchaser shall be liable for the proportionate
amount of such Property Taxes that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax
Period. Upon receipt of any bill for such Property Taxes, Purchaser or either
Seller or an Asset Seller, as applicable, shall present a statement to the
other setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which each is entitled
under this Section 5.8(b) together with such supporting evidence as
is reasonably necessary to calculate the proration amount. The proration
amount shall be paid by the Party owing it to the other within ten days after
delivery of such statement. In the event that Purchaser, Seller or an Asset
Seller makes any payment for which it is entitled to reimbursement under this
Section 5.8(b), the applicable Party shall make such reimbursement promptly
but in no event later than ten days after the presentation of a statement
setting forth the amount of reimbursement to which the presenting Party is
entitled along with such supporting evidence as is reasonably necessary to
calculate the amount of reimbursement. With respect to the Transferred
Subsidiaries, (i) in the case of Property Taxes that are payable for a
Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax related to the portion of such Tax
period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be deemed equal to the
amount of such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Tax period, and (ii) in the case of any other Tax for a Straddle
Period, the amount allocated to the portion of such Tax period ending on and
including the Closing Date shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be
payable if the relevant Tax period ended on and included the Closing Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, responsibility for the Taxes attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period in the preceding sentence is governed by Section 5.8(f).

(c)  _Cooperation_. From the date hereof until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations in effect with respect to the Taxes arising
from the Pre-Closing Tax Period, Purchaser and Seller agree to furnish or
cause to be furnished to the other, upon request, as promptly as practicable,
such information and assistance relating to the Transferred Subsidiaries and
the Purchased Assets as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns by Purchaser or Seller (including information necessary for making a
determination required to be made under Section 7874 of the Code and the
Regulations promulgated thereunder), the making of any election relating to
Taxes, the preparation for, and the prosecution or defense of, any Proceeding
relating to any Tax or Tax Return; provided that, prior to the Merger
Effective Time, Seller shall not be required to furnish, or cause to be
furnished, any information or assistance that it does not have the authority
or right to provide, or cause to be provided, under the terms of the Merger
Agreement. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall retain all books and records
with respect to Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period pertaining to the
Transferred Subsidiaries and the

 



68  Purchased Assets for a period of at least six years following the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be entitled to review
any Tax Return that a Seller joins as a member of an affiliated, combined or
unitary group except for any portion of such Tax Return that relates solely to
a Transferred Subsidiary. Further, Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate and
work together to properly implement the alternate procedure set forth in Rev.
Proc. 2004-53 with respect to the Transferred Employees. All information
shared pursuant to this Section 5.8(c) shall be kept confidential, other than
with respect to such information reasonably needed to be provided to a
Governmental Authority.

(d) _No Amended Returns, etc_. Unless required to comply with an Order
pertaining to a Tax Claim, Purchaser shall not, and shall not cause or permit
any Transferred Subsidiary to (i) make, change or revoke any Tax election or
deemed Tax election (including without limitation an election pursuant to
Section 336 or Section 338 of the Code) that has any retroactive effect in
the portion of any Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) grant an extension of any applicable statute of limitations that
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) amend or cause to be amended any
Tax Return of Transferred Subsidiary that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period,
(iv) initiate contact with a Taxing Authority through a voluntary disclosure
or similar program in respect of Taxes or Tax Returns of any Transferred
Subsidiary for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (v) take any action on the
Closing Date after the Closing not contemplated by this Agreement that is
outside the ordinary course of business of a Transferred Subsidiary that
would otherwise increase the liability of Seller, the Asset Sellers or any of
their respective Affiliates for Taxes pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise,
in each case without the prior written consent of Seller which may not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Unless required to comply
with an Order pertaining to a Tax Claim, Seller shall not, and shall not cause
or permit any of its Affiliates to amend or cause to be amended any Tax Return
of which any Transferred Subsidiary was included if such amendment will
materially and adversely affect the Tax attributes of such Transferred
Subsidiary for any Post-Closing Tax Period without the prior written consent
of Purchaser which may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

(e) _Transferred Subsidiary Tax Returns_.

 

(i) The Company shall, at its expense, prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, the following Tax Returns: (A) all combined, consolidated
or unitary Tax Returns for any Seller Group and (B) in the case of the
Transferred Subsidiaries, any other Income Tax Return for a Taxable period
that ends on or before the Closing Date but is required to be filed
thereafter, and all such Tax Returns, as they relate to the Transferred
Subsidiaries, shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Law and in
accordance and consistent with past practice, unless otherwise required by
applicable Law. Seller will provide Purchaser with a copy of each Tax Return,
together with supporting workpapers, referenced in clause (B) at least 30 days
prior to the due date for such Tax Return for Purchasers review and comment
and Seller shall make such revisions as are reasonably requested by Purchaser
with respect to any items on such Tax Returns relating to the Transferred
Subsidiaries provided by Purchaser prior to the due date for filing any such
Tax Return (taking into account any applicable extensions of time to file).

 



69 (ii) Subject to Section 5.8(e)(iii), Purchaser shall, at Purchasers expense,
prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required
to be filed by or with respect to the Transferred Subsidiaries or the
Purchased Assets other than those prepared by Seller pursuant to Section
5.8(e)(i). Purchaser shall prepare any such Tax Returns that relate to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period of the Transferred Subsidiaries in
accordance with applicable Law and in accordance and consistent with past
practice, unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Purchaser shall
provide a copy of each such Tax Return that relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
or a Straddle Period for their review and comment, together with supporting
documents, at least 30 days prior to the due date for such Tax Return
for Sellers review and comment. Purchaser shall make such revisions as are
reasonably requested by Seller to the extent that such revisions relate to
Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or for which Seller may otherwise be
liable.

 

(iii) For avoidance of doubt, Seller shall have sole discretion regarding the
preparation, filing and content of all combined, consolidated or unitary Tax
Returns for any Seller Group (consistent with and as provided in Section
5.8(e)(i)(A)) consistent with applicable Law and Sellers past practices;
provided, however, that Seller shall provide Purchaser with a copy of a
pro forma Tax Return for each Transferred Subsidiary included in a Seller
Group Tax Return for the Taxable Period that ends on or before the Closing
Date for Purchasers review and comment and Seller shall consider in good
faith any revisions as are reasonably requested by Purchaser.

(f) _Tax Indemnity_.

 

(i) Seller shall indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Parties, including the
Transferred Subsidiaries after the Closing, and hold them harmless from and
against any and all Losses to the extent arising out of or resulting from,
without duplication, any and all Taxes (or the nonpayment thereof) of (A)
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries) for any
taxable period, including its portion of Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section
5.8(a) (but excluding Purchasers portion of such Transfer Taxes), (B) the
Transferred Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including, without
limitation, any such Taxes resulting from any internal restructuring of any
of the Transferred Subsidiaries that occurs prior to the Closing, other than
any such restructuring undertaken in accordance with Purchasers written
request), and (C) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on a Transferred
Subsidiary or the Purchaser or its Affiliates or with respect to a Purchased
Asset, as a transferee or successor, by Contract (other than a Commercial Tax
Agreement) or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an event or
transaction occurring on or before the Closing (including any Taxes for which
a Transferred Subsidiary is liable pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law as a result
of having been a member of a consolidated, combined or similar Tax group
before the Closing); in each case except to the extent attributable to
Purchasers breach of the covenant set forth in Section 5.8(d) or of any
other covenant set forth in this Agreement.

 



70 (ii) Purchaser shall indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and hold them
harmless from and against any and all Losses to the extent arising out of or
resulting from, without duplication, any and all Taxes of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or otherwise solely with respect to the Purchased Assets for any
Post-Closing Tax Period, except to the extent such Tax is attributable to
Sellers or its Affiliates breach of the covenants set forth in this
Agreement.

(g) _Tax Refunds_. All refunds (or credits in lieu of a refund) of Taxes paid
prior to the Closing Date relating to the Transferred Subsidiaries for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (or other Taxes which Seller or any of its Affiliates
have paid pursuant to this Section 5.8) shall be for the account of Seller,
except to the extent any such refund (or credit in lieu of a refund) is
attributable to any loss or other Tax attribute that arises in a Post-Closing
Tax Period. Purchaser shall, if Seller so requests and at Sellers expense,
use commercially reasonable efforts to file for and obtain or cause the
Transferred Subsidiaries to file for and obtain any refunds or credits to
which Seller is entitled under this Section 5.8(g). The amount of any refund
of Taxes (or credit in lieu thereof) to which Seller is entitled under this
Section 5.8(g) shall be paid over to Seller (net of any incremental Taxes
payable by Purchaser or the Transferred Subsidiaries as a result of
the receipt of such refund) within five days of receipt from any Governmental
Authority. To the extent any Tax refund paid to Seller pursuant to this
Section 5.8(g) is subsequently disallowed or required to be returned to the
applicable Governmental Authority, Seller shall repay the amount of such
refund, together with any interest, penalties or other additional amounts
imposed by such Governmental Authority by reason of such disallowance or
requirement to return, to Purchaser within five days of receiving notice of
such disallowance.

(h) _Tax Claims_.

 

(i) Purchaser, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other, shall inform the
other in writing promptly after receipt of notice of any audit, claim,
inquiry, examination or other proceeding relating to Taxes of the Transferred
Subsidiaries or otherwise with respect to the Purchased Assets for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or which may otherwise be the subject of an indemnification
claim pursuant to Section 5.8(f) of this Agreement (a " _Tax Claim_ ");
provided, however, a failure to give such notice shall not affect a Partys
rights to indemnification hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying
party is prejudiced by such failure. Such notice shall include a copy of the
relevant portion of any correspondence received from the relevant Governmental
Authority and describe in reasonable detail the nature of such Tax Claim.
Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any
Tax Claim. Seller shall, at its expense, have the right to elect to control
the conduct of (A) any Tax Claim that does not include a Straddle Period and
(B) any Tax Claim that relates solely to the Purchased Assets; provided, that
if Seller elects to control such Tax Claim, Seller shall keep Purchaser
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Claim;
provided, further, Purchaser shall be entitled at its expense to participate
in any such Tax Claim and Seller shall not abandon, compromise or settle any
such Tax Claim or appeal any adverse determination made by a Governmental
Authority with respect to such Tax Claim without obtaining Purchasers
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If Seller does not elect to control the conduct of a
Tax Claim, then Purchaser shall control the conduct of the Tax Claim at
Sellers expense, but Purchaser shall keep Seller informed regarding the
progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Claim, Seller shall be entitled
to participate in such Tax Claim at its expense, and Purchaser shall not
abandon, compromise or settle any such Tax Claim without obtaining Sellers
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



71 (ii) Purchaser shall control any other Tax Claim relating to Taxes of the
Transferred Subsidiaries or otherwise with respect to the Purchased Assets;
provided, however, that in the case of any such Tax Claim for which Seller is
obligated to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.8(f), Purchaser shall
keep Seller informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such
Tax Claim, Seller shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Claim at its
expense, and Purchaser shall not settle such a Tax Claim without obtaining
Sellers prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Subsidiaries), shall be entitled to control any Tax Claim with
respect to a combined, consolidated or unitary Tax Return for any Seller Group
in its sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that Seller shall not
settle any such Tax Claim in a manner which materially and disproportionately
adversely affects Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries) in a Post-Closing Tax Period for which Seller does
not have an indemnification obligation pursuant to this Agreement without
obtaining Purchasers prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, further, Seller
shall provide Purchaser written notice of the resolution of any Tax Claims to
the extent such resolution could affect Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Transferred Subsidiaries) in a Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

(i) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Other than with respect to Commercial Tax
Agreements, Seller shall cause all Tax allocation agreements or Tax sharing
agreements between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than a Transferred
Subsidiary), on the one hand, and any Transferred Subsidiary, on the other
hand, to be terminated as of the Closing Date, and shall ensure that such
agreements are of no further force or effect as to any of the Transferred
Subsidiaries on and after the Closing Date and that there shall be no further
liabilities or obligations imposed on any of the Transferred Subsidiaries
under any such agreements.

 

(j) _Conflict_. In the event of any conflict between this Section 5.8 and
Article VIII as it relates to Taxes, this Section 5.8 shall govern.

5.9 Mail Handling. From and after the Closing Date, to the extent that
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries receives any mail or packages addressed
to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries)
not relating to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities, Purchaser
shall promptly deliver such mail or packages to Seller. After the Closing
Date, Purchaser may deliver to Seller any checks or drafts made payable to
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Transferred Subsidiaries)
that constitutes a Purchased Asset, and Seller shall promptly deposit such
checks or drafts, and, upon receipt of funds, reimburse Purchaser within five
Business Days for the amounts of all such checks or drafts, or, if so
requested by Purchaser, endorse such checks or drafts to Purchaser for
collection. To the extent Seller or any of its Subsidiaries receives any mail
or packages addressed to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries) but relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities, Seller shall promptly deliver such mail or
packages to Purchaser. After the Closing Date, to the extent that Purchaser
receives any cash or checks or drafts made payable to Purchaser that
constitutes an Excluded Asset, Purchaser shall promptly use such cash to, or
deposit such checks or drafts and upon receipt of funds from such checks or

 



72  drafts, reimburse Seller within five Business Days for such amount received,
or, if so requested by Seller, endorse such checks or drafts to Seller for
collection. After the Closing Date, to the extent that Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries receives any cash (including by electronic transfer) or checks or
drafts made payable to Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Transferred Subsidiaries) that constitutes a Purchased Asset or an asset of
any of the Transferred Subsidiaries (including any accounts receivable of the
Business in respect of goods sold or services provided after the Closing),
Seller shall promptly use such cash to, or deposit such checks or drafts and
upon receipt of funds from such checks or drafts, reimburse Purchaser within
five Business Days for such amount received, or, if so requested by Purchaser,
endorse such checks or drafts to Purchaser for collection. All payments other
than by check or draft described in this Section 5.9 shall be remitted no
later than five Business Days following receipt. The Parties may not assert
any set off, hold back, escrow or other restriction against any payment
described in this Section 5.9. 

5.10 No Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals. Seller shall not, and shall
cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, (a) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage or
facilitate the making or submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (b)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person regarding an
Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that informing a Person of the
existence of this Agreement after any such Person contacts Seller regarding an
Acquisition Proposal and the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.10 shall
not be a breach of this Section 5.10) or (c) furnish any information to any
other Person with respect to, or agree to or otherwise enter into, any
Acquisition Proposal. Seller hereby confirms that it has discontinued, and has
previously directed its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives to discontinue, any solicitation efforts or negotiations with
respect to or in furtherance of any Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall
promptly (and in any event within three Business Days after receipt thereof
by Seller, any of its Affiliates or its or their respective Representatives)
advise Purchaser orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any
request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or
any inquiry with respect to or which could reasonably be expected to result
in an Acquisition Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, and the identity of the Person making the
same. In addition, Seller agrees that it shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to enforce its rights under Section 6.03 of the Merger Agreement as it
relates to any Acquisition Proposal and shall provide Purchaser prompt notice
of any notices or other information that Seller receives with respect
thereto.

5.11 Noncompetition; Nonsolicitation.

 

(a) In order that Purchaser may have and enjoy the full benefit of the
Business, Seller agrees that for a period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the second anniversary thereof (the " _Term_ "), Seller shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, (i) engage, directly or indirectly, in any Competing Business; or
(ii) acquire or own more than 15% of the outstanding equity interests in any
Business Competitor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Seller nor any of
its Affiliates shall be precluded from (A) engaging in the Retained Business,
and reasonably expected or foreseeable extensions of those businesses and the
products developed or sold, and the services developed or provided in
connection therewith (other than any such extensions, products or services
relating to standalone Wi-Fi access points or controllers); or (B) acquiring,
merging with or consolidating with any Person which, at the time of the
parties agreement to enter into such transaction is not a Business
Competitor.

 



73 (b) For purposes of this Section 5.11, (i) " _Business Competitor_ "
shall mean any Person that derived more than 25% of its consolidated gross
revenues from a Competing Business during the four fiscal quarters prior to
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries entering into an agreement providing for
the investment in or acquisition of such Person, and (ii) " _Competing
Business_ " shall mean the business that designs, develops, manufactures,
markets, sells, installs or distributes products in competition with the
Business (as conducted as of the Closing).

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 5.11 shall
not restrict Seller or any of its Affiliates from acquiring and operating any
Person who is a Business Competitor so long as Seller or such Affiliate
divests all or the required portion of the Competing Business conducted by
such Person (the " _Divestiture_ ") within one year of the consummation of
such transaction such that an acquisition by Seller or such Affiliate of the
retained portion of the Competing Business would be permissible under the
terms of the foregoing Section 5.11(a)(ii).

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5.11 shall not be applicable to
(i) any Person or any of its Affiliates (other than Ultimate Parent and its
Subsidiaries) that acquires an interest in Ultimate Parent or its Subsidiaries
through any merger, stock purchase, asset purchase or other business
combination (provided that such Person was not an Affiliate of
Ultimate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries prior to such transaction), (ii)
any Person as of and following such time that such Person ceases to be an
Affiliate of Seller, (iii) the marketing, sale, installation or distribution
by Seller or its Affiliates of any products which incorporate optics products
of an original equipment manufacturer or other third party or (iv) the design,
development, manufacture, marketing, sale, installation or distribution by
Seller and its Affiliates of devices, components or other products for use in
standalone Wi-Fi access points or controllers or IoT gateways (it being
understood that this clause (iv) does not permit the design, development,
manufacture, marketing, sale, installation or distribution by Seller and its
Affiliates of standalone Wi-Fi access point or controller products or IoT
gateways themselves).

(e) To the extent Purchaser believes that Seller is in breach of Section
5.11(a), Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
written notice to Seller of the operations of Seller or its Affiliates that
Purchaser believes constitute a violation of Section 5.11(a) and a period of
10 days following receipt of such notice to resolve such alleged breach (the "
_Resolution Period_ "). Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
basis for such alleged breach. The senior management of the Parties,
including each Partys legal and business Representatives, shall meet
(including via telephone) and attempt in good faith to negotiate a resolution
of such dispute during the Resolution Period, it being understood that
Purchaser shall have no obligation to resolve such alleged breach or to make
any concessions to Seller.

(f) Seller agrees that during the Term, Seller shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or recruit any Transferred
Employee to leave or terminate his or her employment with Purchaser or its
Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it shall not be a breach of this
paragraph for Seller or its Affiliates to (i) conduct general, non-directed
solicitation advertisements or web postings for employment or utilizing an
independent

 



74  employment search firm who has been instructed not to target employees of
Purchaser or its Affiliates or (ii) solicit any Transferred Employee whose
employment with Purchaser or any of its Affiliate has been terminated
(provided there was no breach of this paragraph with respect to such
Transferred Employee prior to such termination).

 

5.12 Termination of Use of Name and Marks.

 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date (but, in any
event, within 90 days after the Closing Date), Purchaser shall make all
filings with any office, agency or body and take all other actions necessary
to effect the elimination of all uses of "Brocade" from the corporate names
(to the extent not changed prior to the Closing), registered names or
registered fictitious names of the Transferred Subsidiaries.

(b) Seller hereby agrees that upon the Closing, Purchaser and the
Transferred Subsidiaries shall have the sole right to use the names and
trademarks listed on _Annex 2_ hereto (the " _Sold Marks_ "). Seller shall
not, and shall not permit its Subsidiaries to, use and of the Sold Marks or
any variation or simulation thereof in any manner in the world after the
Closing, except as required by applicable Law or in connection with disclosure
of historical activities of Seller and its Subsidiaries.

 

5.13 Excluded Litigation Liabilities. In connection with any Proceeding for
which the related Liabilities constitute Excluded Litigation Liabilities,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to,
reasonably cooperate in the investigation and defense by Seller and its
Affiliates of such Proceeding (at Sellers cost and expense), including, (a)
permitting Seller, its Affiliates and their respective Representatives to
discuss during regular business hours matters related to such Proceeding with
such officers, employees, consultants and Representatives of Purchaser and
its Affiliates as Seller reasonably requests, (b) permitting Seller, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives to have reasonable access to
the properties, books, records, papers and documents of Purchaser, its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) and their respective
Representatives related to such Proceeding during regular business hours and
upon prior notice to review information and documentation related to such
Proceeding, (c) notifying Seller promptly of receipt by Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) of any subpoena or other
third party request for documents or interviews and testimony, and (d)
providing to Seller copies of any documents produced by Purchaser or its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Subsidiaries) in response to or
compliance with any subpoena or other third party request for documents. The
Parties agree that all communications between any Party or its Affiliates and
counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of such Proceeding
shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable
attorney-client or work-product privilege.

 

5.14 Required Business Financial Statements. If Purchaser determines in good
faith that Purchaser is required to file the financial statements of the
Business with the SEC under the 1934 Act pursuant to Rule 3-05 of Regulation
S-X in connection with a filing made with the SEC on Form 8-K announcing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Purchaser shall promptly file with the SEC a request for the SECs
concurrence with filing certain abbreviated financial statements (such
financial statements to include audited statement of revenues and direct
operating expenses and an audited statement of acquired assets

 



75  and liabilities) in lieu of the full financial statements otherwise required
by Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X. Such financial statements (whether full or
abbreviated) and such other information, if any, required by the SEC in
response to the waiver letter are referred to herein as the " _Required
Business Financial Statements_ "; provided, that the Required Business
Financial Statements must satisfy the requirements of any registration
statement under the 1933 Act filed by Purchaser prior to the filing of its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2017; provided,
further that in no event shall the Required Business Financial Statements
be required to include (i) any pro forma financial information or (ii) any
financial statements for periods ending on or after the Closing Date or other
than for the three most recently completed fiscal years of the Company (or
such shorter period as may be required by Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X).
Seller will provide such reasonable cooperation and assistance as may be
required by Purchaser in connection with preparing such waiver letter. As
promptly as practicable following the SECs response to such waiver letter,
Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Company to provide to
Purchaser the Required Business Financial Statements.

 

5.15 Shared Contracts.

 

(a) Within 30 days after the date hereof, Seller shall deliver an updated
Section 3.6(c) of the Disclosure Schedule that sets forth a correct and
complete list of Shared Contracts. A Shared Contract that is added to Schedule
3.6(c) of the Disclosure Schedule pursuant to this Section 5.15(a) is referred
to herein as a " _Supplemental Shared Contract_."

 

(b) Seller and Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
arrange for a Transferred Subsidiary or Purchaser Designee, as applicable, to
enter into a new Contract with the applicable Third Party to each Shared
Contract, which new Contract contains the terms and conditions applicable to
the Business as of the date hereof with respect to such Shared Contract.

 

(c) In the event a new Contract is not entered into prior to the Closing as
contemplated by Section 5.15(b), from and after the Closing, Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to develop a mutually agreeable arrangement
(including by way of amendment or addition of services to the Transition
Services Agreement) under which (i) a Transferred Subsidiary or a Purchaser
Designee would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations under such
Shared Contract to the extent applicable to the Business, including by sub-
contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to such Transferred Subsidiary or
Purchaser Designee and/or (ii) such portion of such Shared Contract would be
held, as of and from the Closing Date, by Seller or its applicable Subsidiary
in trust for a Transferred Subsidiary or Purchaser Designee and the covenants
and obligations thereunder would be performed by such Transferred Subsidiary
or Purchaser Designee in Sellers or such Subsidiarys name and all benefits,
obligations and liabilities existing thereunder to the extent applicable to
the Business would be for such Transferred Subsidiarys or Purchaser
Designees account.

 



76 (d) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to
any Supplemental Shared Contracts that involve the licensing or other use of
third party Intellectual Property Rights that are material to the operation or
conduct of the Business, in the event that the continued license or use of
such Intellectual Property Rights in the operation or conduct of the Business
following the Closing Date would require payment by Purchaser or its
Subsidiaries of more than $5,000,000 in the aggregate during the 12-month
period immediately following the Closing Date (after taking into account the
availability of any enterprise licenses or similar rights then held by
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries), Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good
faith with respect to the appropriate allocation of responsibility for such
costs. 

5.16 Indemnification of Officers and Directors.

 

(a) Purchaser agrees that, subject to applicable Law, all rights to
exculpation or indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Closing existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current
and former directors and officers of any Transferred Subsidiary and his or her
heirs and personal representatives (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_"), as
provided in such Transferred Subsidiarys articles or certificates of
incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents)
or in any agreement between any Transferred Subsidiary and such DandO
Indemnitee, shall survive the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
following the Closing, and Purchaser shall cause each Transferred Subsidiary
to fulfill and honor such obligations to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law. In addition, for a period of six years following the Closing
Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Transferred Subsidiaries to, cause
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational or
governing documents) of each Transferred Subsidiary to contain provisions with
respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least as favorable as
the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational or
governing documents) of such Transferred Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and during such six-year period, such provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights of any DandO Indemnitee, except as required by applicable Law.

(b) The provisions of this Section 5.16 shall survive the Closing and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each DandO Indemnitee,
and nothing in this Agreement shall affect any indemnification rights that any
such DandO Indemnitee may have under the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of any Transferred Subsidiary or any Contract or Applicable Law.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations
under this Section 5.16 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnitee without the consent of such DandO
Indemnitee.

 

(c) In the event that any of the Transferred Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective successors or assigns) shall consolidate or merge with any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in
such consolidation or merger, or transfers at least fifty percent (50%) of its
properties and assets to any other person, then in each case proper
provision shall be made so that the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity (or its successors or assigns, if applicable), or transferee of such
assets, as the case may be, shall, unless such corporation or entity (or its
successors or assigns, if applicable) is otherwise bound by the obligations
set forth in this Section 5.16 by applicable Law, assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.16.

 



77 (d) Nothing in this Section 5.16 shall alter or modify in any way the
indemnification provisions set forth in Article VIII or the other applicable
provisions hereof relating to Excluded Liabilities or Excluded Litigation
Liabilities.

 

ARTICLE VI

TERMINATION

7.1 Termination Events. Without prejudice to other remedies which may be
available to the Parties by Law or this Agreement, this Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parties;

 

(b) by either Party by notice to the other Party if the Closing shall not have
been consummated on or prior to the date which is six months following the
date hereof (such later date, the " _Outside Date_ "); provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(b) shall not be
available to either Party whose failure to perform in all material respects
any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date; provided,
further, that if the conditions set forth in Section 6.1(b) or 6.1(c) shall
not have been satisfied or waived as of the Outside Date but all other
conditions set forth in Article VI shall have been satisfied or waived (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but provided that such conditions shall then be capable of being satisfied if
the Closing were to take place on such date), then either Party may, in its
sole and exclusive discretion, extend the End Date to the date which is nine
months following the date hereof by providing the other Party written notice
of such extension on or before the Outside Date;

(c) by either Party by written notice to the other Party, if (i) a final,
non-appealable Order, decree or ruling enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on
the Closing Date has been issued by any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction (unless such Order, decree or ruling has been withdrawn, reversed
or otherwise made inapplicable) or (ii) any Law has been enacted that would
make the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
occur on the Closing Date illegal;

(d) by Purchaser by written notice to Seller (which shall include notice of
Purchasers intention to terminate pursuant to this Section 7.1(d)), if (i)
any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement shall be
inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.3(a) would not be
satisfied, or (ii) the covenants or obligations of Seller contained in this
Agreement shall have been breached in any material respect such that the
condition set forth in Section 6.3(b) would not be satisfied; provided _,_
however, that if an inaccuracy or breach is curable by Seller during the
15-day period after Purchaser notifies Seller in writing of the existence of
such inaccuracy or breach (the " _Seller Cure Period_ "), then Purchaser may
not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(d) as a result of such
inaccuracy or breach prior to the expiration of the Seller Cure Period unless
Seller is no longer continuing to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
cure such inaccuracy or breach;

 



80 (e) by Seller by written notice to Purchaser (which shall include notice of
Sellers intention to terminate pursuant to this Section 7.1(e)), if (i) any
representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement shall be
inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) would not be
satisfied, or (ii) the covenants or obligations of Purchaser contained in
this Agreement shall have been breached in any material respect such that the
condition set forth in Section 6.2(b) would not be satisfied; provided _,_
however, that if an inaccuracy or breach is curable by Purchaser during the
15-day period after Seller notifies Purchaser in writing of the existence of
such inaccuracy or breach (the " _Purchaser Cure Period_ "), then Seller may
not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) as a result of such
inaccuracy or breach prior to the expiration of the Purchaser Cure Period
unless Purchaser is no longer continuing to exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to cure such inaccuracy or breach; or

(f) by either Party by notice to the other Party, if the Merger Agreement
shall have been validly terminated pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Merger
Agreement.

7.2 Effect of Termination.

 

(a) Except as set forth in this Section 7.2, in the event of any termination
of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall forthwith
become wholly void and of no further force and effect, all further obligations
of the parties under this Agreement shall terminate and there shall be no
liability on the part of either Party to the other Party, except that the
provisions of Sections 5.2(c) (Confidentiality), 5.4 (Public Disclosures) and
Article IX (Miscellaneous Agreements of the Parties) of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and the Parties shall remain bound by and
continue to be subject to the provisions thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the provisions of this Section 7.2 shall not relieve either Party
of any liability for any Willful Breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) If, but only if, (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
7.1(f) and (ii) Seller actually receives a Company Termination Fee (as
defined in the Merger Agreement) from the Company pursuant to Section 9.03 of
the Merger Agreement, then Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for all reasonable
out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Purchaser in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such
expenses, collectively, the " _Third Party Expenses_ "), up to a maximum
of $4,000,000 in the aggregate, by wire transfer of same-day funds within
five Business Days following the date on which Purchaser delivers to Seller
true and correct copies of reasonable documentation supporting such Third
Party Expenses; provided, that such Third Party Expenses shall not include
any amounts for a financial advisor to Purchaser or its Affiliates except for
reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses otherwise reimbursable by
Purchaser or its Affiliates to such financial advisor pursuant to the terms
of the engagement letter or similar arrangement with such financial advisor.

 



81 ARTICLE VIII

 

INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 Indemnification.

(a) Following the Closing and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article VIII, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless each of Purchaser,
Purchasers Affiliates and their respective Representatives and successors
(each, a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any Losses
actually incurred or sustained by such Purchaser Indemnified Party ("
_Purchaser Losses_ ") as a proximate result of (i) any breach of or inaccuracy
in any representation or warranty of Seller set forth in this Agreement or in
the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.3(c), (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Seller herein, (iii) any Excluded Liabilities, (iv)
any Excluded Litigation Liabilities of the Transferred Subsidiaries and (v)
the Retained Ruckus Liabilities. 

(b) Following the Closing and subject to the terms and conditions provided in
this Article VIII, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Seller, Sellers Affiliates and their respective Representatives and
successors (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") from and against any
Losses actually incurred or sustained by such Seller Indemnified Party ("
_Seller Losses_ ") as a proximate result of (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation or warranty of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement or in
the certificate delivered pursuant to Section 6.2(c), (ii) any breach of any
covenant or agreement of Purchaser herein, (iii) any and all Liabilities of
the Transferred Subsidiaries whether arising on, before or after the Closing
(other than any Losses indemnifiable under Section 8.1(a) (determined without
regard to Section 8.2) or under Section 5.8), and (iv) any Assumed
Liabilities.

8.2 Certain Limitations.

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Seller shall
not be obligated to indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Parties for aggregate
Purchaser Losses (i) under this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i) in
excess of $100,000,000; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in
this clause (i) shall not apply to breaches of Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.6(a),
3.13, 3.14(c), 3.14(e), 3.14(f), 3.14(h) and 3.17 (the " _Seller Fundamental
Representations_ ") or (ii) under this Agreement (other than pursuant to
Section 5.8 or Sections 8.1(a)(iii) through (v)) in excess of an amount equal
to the Purchase Price.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Seller shall
not be obligated to indemnify Purchaser Indemnified Parties under this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i), unless and until the aggregate
Purchaser Losses subject to such indemnification collectively exceed
$8,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), whereupon such indemnification shall be
made by Seller only with respect to the amount of such Purchaser Losses in
excess of the Deductible; provided, however, that the Deductible shall not
apply to any breach of a Seller Fundamental Representation.

 



82 (c) The representations and warranties of Seller and Purchaser contained in
Article III and Article IV, respectively, of this Agreement shall survive the
Closing and terminate on the date that is 12 months following the Closing
Date; provided that the Seller Fundamental Representations and the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.5 shall
survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

(d) The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a Party pursuant to
Sections 8.1(a)(i) or 8.1(b)(i) shall terminate when the applicable
representation or warranty terminates pursuant to Section 8.2(c); provided,
however, that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not
terminate with respect to any claims as to which the Seller Indemnified Party
or Purchaser Indemnified Party, as the case may be, to be indemnified (each,
an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall have, before the expiration of
the applicable survival period, previously made a claim by delivering a
written notice (stating in reasonable detail the basis of such claim, to the
extent known by the Indemnified Party) to the indemnifying Party hereunder
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ").

(e) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall, to the extent as
would be required under applicable Law, take all reasonable steps to mitigate
all Losses after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected
to give rise to any Losses which are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or
in connection herewith.

 

(f) For purposes of this Article VIII, any breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to
any materiality, Company Material Adverse Effect or other similar
qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such representation or
warranty (other than with respect to (i) the use of such terms in the
representations and warranties in Sections 3.6(c), 3.7 (with, for the
avoidance of doubt, any determination with respect to a breach of the
representation and warranty set forth in the second sentence of Section 3.7
applying "materiality" to the applicable Ruckus Financial Statement(s) or
Revenue Statement taken as a whole and not solely with respect to any
individual line item(s) therein), 3.8(b), 3.14(a) and 3.16(a) in which case
such terms shall not be ignored for the purposes of determining any breach
of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, and (ii) the word
"Material" as used in the term "Company Material Contracts").

 

8.3 Procedures for Third Party Claims and Excluded Liabilities.

 

(a) Promptly after the receipt by any Indemnified Party of a notice of any
Proceeding by any third party that may be subject to indemnification under
this Article VIII, including any Proceeding relating to any Excluded Liability
or Assumed Liability, such Indemnified Party shall give written notice of such
Proceeding to the Indemnifying Party, stating in reasonable detail the nature
and basis of each claim made in the Proceeding and the amount thereof, to the
extent known, along with copies of the relevant documents received by the
Indemnified Party evidencing the Proceeding and the basis for indemnification
sought. Failure of the Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability on account of this
indemnification, except if and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
is actually prejudiced thereby. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall
deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnified Partys
receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Proceeding.

 



83 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense of the
Indemnified Party against the third party claim upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party delivered within 30 days after receipt of the particular
notice from the Indemnified Party which such notice shall include Indemnifying
Partys agreement that it will provide full indemnification to the
Indemnified Party for all Losses relating thereto in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not
have the right to assume the defense of the third party claim (i) if such
third party claim seeks as its primary remedy the imposition of an equitable
remedy that is binding upon Purchaser, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities, or (ii) the amount of Losses relating to such third party claim
could be reasonably expected to exceed the amounts for which the Indemnifying
Party is obligated to indemnify hereunder.

(c) So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the third
party claim in accordance herewith and notified the Indemnified Party in
writing thereof, (i) the Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at
its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of the third party
claim, it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall pay all
reasonable costs and expenses of co-counsel for the Indemnified Party (A) if
the Indemnified Party reasonably and in good faith believes that a conflict
of interest exists or could arise which, under applicable principles of legal
ethics could prohibit a single legal counsel from representing both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in such Proceeding or (B) during
the period after such time as the Indemnified Party has notified the
Indemnifying Party of such third party claim and prior to such time as the
Indemnifying Party has notified the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense of such third party claim, (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall not file any papers or consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the third party claim without the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) and (iii) the Indemnifying Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the third party claim (other than a judgment or settlement that is solely
for money damages in an amount less than the remaining balance of the
limitations on indemnity set forth in Section 8.2 and is accompanied by the
Indemnifying Partys irrevocable commitment to make payment of amounts set
forth in such settlement or judgment and a release of all indemnifiable claims
against the Indemnified Party) without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, which such consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party shall have
assumed the defense, such Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to
indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement
entered into without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) In the case of any third party claims where the Indemnifying Party
reasonably believes that it would be appropriate to settle such claim using
equitable remedies (i.e., remedies involving the future use of the Purchased
Assets), the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall work together
in good faith to agree to a settlement; provided, however, that no Party shall
be under any obligation to agree to any such settlement.

 

(e) Any payment made pursuant to the indemnification obligations arising under
this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the
extent allowable under applicable Law.

 



84 (f) Any indemnity obligation under this Agreement shall be decreased by any
amounts actually received by the Indemnified Party under third party
insurance policies and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment
actually received by the Indemnified Party from any third party with respect
thereto, net of any deductibles or co-payments paid by such Indemnified Party
under the relevant insurance policy, any "retro-premium" obligations in
connection with such Loss and any costs incurred by such Indemnified Party in
procuring such payment under such policy (the " _Net Insurance Proceeds_ "),
each Party agreeing (i) to use commercially reasonable efforts to recover all
available insurance proceeds and (ii) to the extent that any indemnity payment
under this Agreement has been paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf
of the Indemnified Party prior to the receipt, directly or indirectly, by the
Indemnified Party of any Net Insurance Proceeds under third party insurance
policies on account of such Loss which duplicate, in whole or in part, the
payment made by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnified Party shall remit to the Indemnifying Party an amount
equal to the amount of the Net Insurance Proceeds actually received by
the Indemnified Party on account of such Loss which duplicate, in whole or in
part, the payment made by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party. The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under
this Agreement shall be calculated net of any Tax Benefits actually realized
by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates on account of such Losses or
any of the circumstances giving rise thereto. If the Indemnified Party
actually realizes a Tax Benefit at any time after the indemnity payment is
made to it, the Indemnified Party shall promptly pay to the Indemnifying Party
the amount of such Tax Benefit. For purposes hereof, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall
mean, with respect to any applicable Losses, any cash Tax savings or refunds
that are actually realized by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
in the Tax year of the respective Losses or the two immediately succeeding Tax
years, and any amounts reasonably anticipated to be credited against cash
Taxes payable of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates in the Tax
year of the respective Losses or the two immediately succeeding Tax years.

 

8.4 Certain Procedures. The Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying
Party promptly of its discovery of any matter that may give rise to a claim
for indemnification pursuant hereto; provided, however, that failure of the
Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from liability on account of this indemnification, except if and only to
the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby. The
Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives
to, reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the
validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party. Subject to the
provisions of Section 8.3, in connection with any actual or threatened claims
by, or actual or threatened litigation or other disputes with, third parties
relating to Assumed Liabilities or Excluded Liabilities, any such claims,
litigation and disputes being referred to as " _claims_ " for purposes of this
Section 8.4, to the extent such activities are permitted by applicable Law and
would not result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, the
Indemnified Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives
to, reasonably cooperate in the defense by the Indemnifying Party of such
claim (at the Indemnifying Partys cost and expense), including, (i)
permitting the Indemnifying Party to discuss during regular business hours the
claim with such officers, employees, consultants and Representatives of the
Indemnified Party as the Indemnifying Party reasonably requests, (ii)
permitting the Indemnifying Party to have reasonable access to the properties,
books, records, papers, documents, plans, drawings, electronic mail, databases
and computers of the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates and
Representatives related to the claim during regular business hours and upon

 



85  prior notice to review information and documentation relative to the claim,
(iii) notifying the Indemnifying Party promptly of receipt by the Indemnified
Party of any subpoena or other third party request for documents or
interviews and testimony, and (iv) providing to the Indemnifying Party copies
of any documents produced by the Indemnified Party in response to or
compliance with any subpoena or other third party request for documents.

8.5 Remedies Exclusive. Following the Closing, subject to the dispute
resolution procedure set forth in Section 2.2 hereof, the remedies set forth
in this Article VIII shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy for money
damages and shall be in lieu of any other remedies for money damages that may
be available to the Indemnified Parties under any other agreement or pursuant
to any statutory or common law (including Environmental Law) with respect to
any Losses of any kind or nature incurred directly or indirectly resulting
from or arising out of any of this Agreement, the Business, the Purchased
Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or the Excluded Liabilities (it being
understood that nothing in this Section 8.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall affect the Parties rights to specific performance or other similar non-
monetary equitable remedies with respect to the covenants referred to in this
Agreement or the Parties rights under the other Transaction Documents);
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.5 or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall limit any Persons right to seek any remedy on account of any
Partys Fraud, criminal misconduct or Willful Breach. Seller and Purchaser
each hereby waive any provision of any applicable Law to the extent that it
would limit or restrict the agreement contained in this Section 8.5.

9.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
principles of conflicts of laws that would require the application of the laws
of any other jurisdiction.

 



88 9.9 Jurisdiction. Each of the Parties hereto irrevocably consents to the
exclusive jurisdiction and venue of Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware) in connection with
any matter based upon or arising from this Agreement or the matters
contemplated herein, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner
authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware for such persons and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, and

obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement
or other communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in
counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by
facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the Parties to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement.

 

9.12 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, and each
of the documents, instruments and agreements delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the other Transaction
Documents and the Disclosure Schedule, constitute the entire agreement between
the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.

 

9.13 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental
Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms,
provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated
so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated
hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to either Party. Upon
such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.
