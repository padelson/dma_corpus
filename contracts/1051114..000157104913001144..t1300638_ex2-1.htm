Company to maintain three directors who are members of the board of directors of the Company on the date of this Agreement, each
of whom shall be &ldquo;independent&rdquo; for purposes of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and also eligible to serve on the Company&rsquo;s
audit committee under the Exchange Act and Nasdaq rules and regulations and at least one of whom shall be an &ldquo;audit committee
financial expert&rdquo; as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto (the &ldquo;<U>Continuing
Directors</U>&rdquo;); <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability
or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary action (including creating a committee of the board of directors of the Company)
so that the Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or designate another person (or persons) to fill such vacancy, and
such person (or persons) shall be deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no Continuing Director
then remains, the other directors shall designate three persons who shall each qualify as &ldquo;independent&rdquo; for purposes
of Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and eligible to serve on the Company&rsquo;s audit committee under the Exchange
Act and Nasdaq rules and regulations and at least one of whom shall be an &ldquo;audit committee financial expert&rdquo; as defined
in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto, to fill such vacancies and such persons shall be deemed Continuing
Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any of Purchaser&rsquo;s
designees have been elected or appointed to the board of directors of the Company after the Offer Closing and prior to the Effective
Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall (in addition to the approval rights of the shareholders
of the Company as may be required by the governing documents of the Company or applicable Law) be required (and upon such vote
the Company will be deemed authorized without any further vote of the board of directors) for the Company (i)&nbsp;to amend or
terminate this Agreement, (ii) to extend the time of performance of, or waive, any of the obligations or other acts of Parent or
Purchaser under this Agreement, or to exercise or waive any of the Company&rsquo;s rights, benefits or remedies hereunder, (iii)
except as provided herein, to amend the governing documents of the Company, or (iv) to take any other action or make any other
determination of the board of directors of the Company under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transaction. The Continuing
Directors shall have, and Purchaser shall cause the Continuing Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may
include current counsel to the Company or the board of directors of the Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company
as determined by the Continuing Directors, and the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company to enforce performance
of this Agreement. Following the Offer Closing and prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall take any action
to remove any Continuing Director.</P>
