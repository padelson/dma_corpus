iii      AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
REORGANIZATION, dated as of November 3, 2003 (this "Agreement"), by and among
CONEXANT SYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Conexant"), CONCENTRIC SUB,
INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Conexant
("Concentric Sub"), and GLOBESPANVIRATA, INC., a Delaware corporation
("GlobespanVirata").   W I T N E S S E T H :   WHEREAS, the Boards of
Directors of Conexant and GlobespanVirata deem it advisable and in the best
interests of each corporation and its respective stockholders that Conexant
and GlobespanVirata enter into a strategic merger in order to advance the
long-term strategic business interests of Conexant and GlobespanVirata;  
WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Conexant, GlobespanVirata and Concentric
Sub have determined to consummate such strategic merger by means of the
business combination transaction provided for herein in which Concentric
Sub will, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, merge with
and into GlobespanVirata (the "Merger"), with GlobespanVirata being the
surviving corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as
the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Conexant;   WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain
representations, warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and
also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger; and   WHEREAS,
capitalized terms used in this Agreement will have the respective meanings
set forth (i) in Section 8.11 or (ii) in the Sections of this Agreement set
forth opposite such terms in Section 8.11.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   SECTION 1.1 The Merger. Upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of    Delaware (the "DGCL"), at the Effective
Time, Concentric Sub shall merge with and into GlobespanVirata.
GlobespanVirata shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware
under the name "GlobespanVirata, Inc.". Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Concentric Sub shall terminate and
GlobespanVirata shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Conexant.  
SECTION 1.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place as soon as practicable, but in any event within three Business
Days, after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to Applicable Laws) of the
conditions (excluding conditions that, by their nature, cannot be satisfied
until the Closing Date) set forth in Article VI, unless this Agreement has
been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another time or
date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the actual time and date
of the Closing being referred to herein as the "Closing Date"). The Closing
shall be held at the offices of Chadbourne and Parke LLP, 30 Rockefeller Plaza,
New York, New York 10112, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.   SECTION 1.3 Effective Time. The Merger shall become
effective as set forth in the certificate of merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") that shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware (the "Delaware Secretary") on the Closing Date. The term "Effective
Time" shall mean the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set
forth in the Certificate of Merger.   SECTION 1.4 Effect of the Merger. At
and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effect set forth in
the DGCL.   SECTION 1.5 Conversion of GlobespanVirata Common Stock. At
the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Conexant, GlobespanVirata, Concentric Sub or the holders of any
capital stock of Conexant, GlobespanVirata or Concentric Sub:   (a) Subject
to Section 2.2(e), each share of common stock, par value $.001 per share, of
GlobespanVirata (including the associated GlobespanVirata Rights)
("GlobespanVirata Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than shares of GlobespanVirata Common Stock held in
GlobespanVirata\'s treasury or owned by Conexant or any Subsidiary
of GlobespanVirata or Conexant, shall be converted into the right to receive
1.198 (the "Exchange Ratio") shares of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of Conexant (including the associated Conexant Rights) ("Conexant
Common Stock").   (b) All shares of GlobespanVirata Common Stock converted
into the right to receive Conexant Common Stock pursuant to this Article I
shall no longer be    2   outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each
certificate previously representing any such shares of GlobespanVirata Common
Stock (a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
(i) a certificate (or book-entry credit) representing the number of whole
shares of Conexant Common Stock and (ii) cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Conexant Common Stock into which the shares of GlobespanVirata Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this
Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e). Certificates shall be exchanged for
certificates representing whole shares of Conexant Common Stock and cash in
lieu of fractional shares issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender
of such Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, without any interest
thereon. If, between the date hereof and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of GlobespanVirata Common Stock or Conexant Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, or changed into or exchanged for a different
number or kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse
stock split or other similar change in capitalization, an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Exchange Ratio.   (c) All
shares of GlobespanVirata Common Stock held in GlobespanVirata\'s treasury or
owned by Conexant or any Subsidiary of GlobespanVirata or Conexant shall be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and no shares of Conexant Common Stock or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   SECTION 1.6
Conversion of Concentric Sub Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each share
of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Concentric Sub ("Concentric Sub
Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become an issued and outstanding share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.7 Options and Warrants.  
(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Conexant and GlobespanVirata will take
all action necessary such that each GlobespanVirata Stock Option
and GlobespanVirata Warrant that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior thereto shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of
GlobespanVirata Common Stock and shall be converted into an option or
warrant, as applicable, to purchase shares of Conexant Common Stock in an
amount and at an exercise price (in the case of a GlobespanVirata Stock
Option) and at a purchase price (in the case of the GlobespanVirata Warrant)
determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms of the
appropriate GlobespanVirata Stock Plan pursuant to which such option has been
issued and the agreements evidencing grants thereunder or otherwise subject
to the terms of the GlobespanVirata Warrant, as applicable):    3   
(i) The number of shares of Conexant Common Stock to be  subject to the new
option or the new warrant, as applicable, shall be  equal to the product of
the number of shares of GlobespanVirata Common  Stock subject to the original
option or the original warrant, as  applicable, multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio, provided that any fractional  shares of Conexant Common Stock
resulting from such multiplication shall  be rounded to the nearest whole
share; and   (ii) The exercise price or purchase price, as applicable, per 
share of Conexant Common Stock under the new option or the new warrant, as 
applicable, shall be equal to the exercise price per share of 
GlobespanVirata Common Stock under the original option (or, in the case of  a
warrant, the purchase price per share of GlobespanVirata Common Stock  under
the original warrant) divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that  such
exercise price (or purchase price) shall be rounded to the nearest  whole
cent.   (b) The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options
that are "incentive stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be
effected in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The
duration and other terms of the new option shall be the same as the original
option, except that all references to GlobespanVirata shall be deemed to be
references to Conexant (but taking into account any changes thereto,
including acceleration thereof, provided for in the GlobespanVirata Stock
Plans by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby).   SECTION 1.8 Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation of Concentric Sub (the "Concentric
Sub Certificate") shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in accordance with the terms
thereof and Applicable Laws.   SECTION 1.9 By-Laws. At the Effective Time,
the by-laws of Concentric Sub (the "Concentric Sub By-Laws") shall be the by-
laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with
the terms thereof, the Concentric Sub Certificate and Applicable Laws.  
SECTION 1.10 Officers and Directors. At the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Concentric Sub shall be the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified.   SECTION 1.11 Tax Consequences. It is
intended that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that    4   this Agreement
shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354
and 361 of the Code.   ARTICLE II   EXCHANGE OF SHARES   SECTION 2.1
Conexant to Make Shares Available. From time to time, prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, Conexant shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited,
with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Conexant and
GlobespanVirata (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of the
Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article II,
certificates representing the shares of Conexant Common Stock to be issued
pursuant to Section 1.5 and delivered pursuant to Section 2.2(a) in exchange
for Certificates (such certificates for shares of Conexant Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, the
"Exchange Fund").   SECTION 2.2 Exchange of Shares.   (a) As soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
mail to each holder of record of one or more Certificates a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in customary form
and have such other provisions as Conexant or GlobespanVirata may
reasonably request) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for certificates representing the shares of Conexant
Common Stock (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares) into which the
shares of GlobespanVirata Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate or Certificates shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such properly completed
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, (i) the number of shares
of Conexant Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested) representing that number of whole
shares of Conexant Common Stock to which such holder shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a
check representing the amount of any cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Conexant Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive in respect of
the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest
will be paid or accrued on any cash    5   in lieu of fractional shares
or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to holders of
Certificates.   (b) No dividends or other distributions declared or made
with respect to Conexant Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of
any unsurrendered Certificate (and no cash payment in lieu of fractional
shares of Conexant Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to
Section 2.2(e)) until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of Applicable Laws,
following surrender of any Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of
shares of Conexant Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Conexant Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(e) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Conexant Common Stock
and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Conexant Common Stock.   (c) If any
certificate representing shares of Conexant Common Stock is to be issued in a
name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by
an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for
transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay to
the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason
of the issuance of a certificate representing shares of Conexant Common Stock
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (d) After the Effective Time,
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of GlobespanVirata of
the shares of GlobespanVirata Common Stock that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for certificates representing shares of Conexant
Common Stock (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares) as provided in this
Article II.   (e) (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein,  no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Conexant
Common  Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the
surrender  for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or distribution with
respect to  Conexant Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any
such  fractional share, and such    6    fractional share interests
shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or  to any other rights of a
stockholder of Conexant. In lieu of the issuance  of any such fractional
share, Conexant shall pay to each holder of  Certificates who otherwise would
be entitled to receive such fractional  share an amount in cash determined in
the manner provided in clauses (ii)  and (iii) of this Section 2.2(e).  
(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time,  the Exchange
Agent shall determine the excess of (x) the aggregate number  of whole shares
of Conexant Common Stock into which shares of  GlobespanVirata Common Stock
have been converted pursuant to Section 1.5  over (y) the aggregate number of
whole shares of Conexant Common Stock to  be distributed to holders of
Certificates pursuant to this Section 2.2  (such excess being herein referred
to as the "Excess Shares"). As soon  after the Effective Time as practicable,
the Exchange Agent, as agent for  such holders of Certificates, shall sell
the Excess Shares at then  prevailing prices on the Nasdaq National Market
System, all in the manner  provided in clause (iii) of this Section
2.2(e).   (iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent  shall
be executed on the Nasdaq National Market System through one or more  member
firms of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and  shall be
executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net  proceeds of
any such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders of  Certificates,
the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such  holders as part
of the Exchange Fund. Conexant shall pay all commissions,  transfer taxes and
other out-of-pocket transaction costs of the Exchange  Agent incurred in
connection with such sale or sales of Excess Shares. In  addition, Conexant
shall pay the Exchange Agent\'s compensation and  expenses in connection with
such sale or sales. The Exchange Agent shall  determine the portion of such
net proceeds to which each holder of  Certificates shall be entitled, if any,
by multiplying the amount of the  aggregate net proceeds by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount  of the fractional share interest in
Conexant Common Stock to which such  holder of Certificates is entitled
(after taking into account all  Certificates then held by such holder) and
the denominator of which is the  aggregate amount of fractional share
interests in Conexant Common Stock to  which all holders of Certificates are
entitled. As soon as practicable  after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to  holders of Certificates with respect to any
fractional share interests in  Conexant Common Stock, the Exchange Agent
shall promptly pay such amounts  to such holders of Certificates subject to
and in accordance with this  Section 2.2.   (f) Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains unclaimed by holders of Certificates for twelve months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Conexant, and any holders of
Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this    7   Article
II shall thereafter look only to Conexant for payment of the shares
of Conexant Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Conexant
Common Stock and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Conexant
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of GlobespanVirata Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any such portion of the Exchange
Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Certificates five years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity) shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, become the
property of Conexant free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.   (g) None of Conexant, Concentric Sub,
GlobespanVirata, the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any holder of Certificates for any amount delivered in good faith to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Applicable Laws.   (h) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in
the Exchange Fund on a daily basis as directed by Conexant. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Conexant
promptly upon request by Conexant.   (i) In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed,
and the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Conexant may
determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares
of Conexant Common Stock (and any cash in lieu of fractional shares)
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   (j) All
references in this Agreement to Certificates shall include any book-entry
credits representing shares of GlobespanVirata Common Stock.   SECTION 2.3
Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, no certificates representing shares of Conexant
Common Stock or cash shall be delivered to a Person who may be deemed an
"affiliate" of GlobespanVirata in accordance with Section 5.15, for purposes
of Rule 145 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
Act"), until such Person has executed and delivered an Affiliate Agreement
pursuant to Section 5.15.    8    ARTICLE III   REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES   SECTION 3.1 Representations and Warranties of
GlobespanVirata. Except as set forth in the GlobespanVirata Disclosure
Schedule delivered by GlobespanVirata to Conexant prior to the execution of
this Agreement (the "GlobespanVirata Disclosure Schedule") (each section of
which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or
covenant of GlobespanVirata to the extent specified therein), GlobespanVirata
represents and warrants to Conexant as follows:   (a) Organization,
Standing and Power; Subsidiaries.   (i) Each of GlobespanVirata and its
Subsidiaries is a  corporation or other organization duly organized, validly
existing and in  good standing (where applicable) under the laws of its
jurisdiction of  incorporation or organization, has the requisite power and
authority to  own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now  being conducted and as it will be conducted through the
Effective Time,  except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in
good standing  or to have such power and authority, individually or in the
aggregate,  would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on  GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries, and is duly qualified and in
good  standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
its  business or the ownership or leasing of its properties makes such 
qualification necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the  failure
so to qualify or to be in good standing, individually or in the  aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect on
GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries. The copies of the  certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of GlobespanVirata which were  previously furnished
or made available to Conexant are true, complete and  correct copies of such
documents as in effect on the date of this  Agreement.   (ii) Section
3.1(a)(ii) of the GlobespanVirata Disclosure  Schedule sets forth a list of
all the Subsidiaries of GlobespanVirata  which as of the date of this
Agreement are Significant Subsidiaries (as  defined in Rule 1-02 of
Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange  Commission (the "SEC")). All
the outstanding shares of capital stock of,  or other equity interests in,
each such Significant Subsidiary have been  validly issued and are fully paid
and nonassessable and are owned directly  or indirectly by GlobespanVirata,
free and clear of all material pledges,  claims, liens, charges, encumbrances
and security interests of any kind or  nature whatsoever (collectively,
"Liens") and free of any    9    other material restriction (including
any restriction on the right to  vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such
capital stock or other equity  interests). None of GlobespanVirata or any of
its Subsidiaries directly or  indirectly owns any equity or similar interest
in, or any interest  convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
equity or similar  interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture
or other business  association or entity (other than Subsidiaries) that is or
would  reasonably be expected to be material to GlobespanVirata and its 
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.   (b) Capital Structure.   (i) The
authorized capital stock of GlobespanVirata consists  of 400,000,000 shares
of GlobespanVirata Common Stock and 10,000,000  shares of preferred stock,

24, 2003, (i) 149,089,683 shares of  GlobespanVirata Common Stock and (ii) no

treasury shares. Since October 24, 2003 to the date of this Agreement, no 
shares of capital stock of GlobespanVirata or any other securities of 
GlobespanVirata have been issued other than shares of GlobespanVirata  Common
Stock issued pursuant to (x) GlobespanVirata Stock Options  outstanding as of
October 24, 2003 under the GlobespanVirata Stock Plans  and (y) the
GlobespanVirata ESPP. All issued and outstanding shares of  capital stock of
GlobespanVirata are duly authorized, validly issued,  fully paid and
nonassessable, and no class of capital stock of  GlobespanVirata is entitled
to preemptive rights. There are outstanding as  of the date hereof no
options, warrants or other rights to acquire capital  stock from
GlobespanVirata other than (A) preferred share purchase rights  (the
"GlobespanVirata Rights") distributed to the holders of  GlobespanVirata
Common Stock pursuant to the GlobespanVirata Rights  Agreement, (B)
GlobespanVirata Stock Options under the GlobespanVirata  Stock Plans, (C) the

purchase 450,000 shares of  GlobespanVirata Common Stock (the
"GlobespanVirata Warrant") and (E)  rights to acquire shares of
GlobespanVirata Common Stock pursuant to the  GlobespanVirata ESPP. Section
3.1(b)(i) of the GlobespanVirata Disclosure  Schedule sets forth a complete
and correct list as October 24, 2003 of all  outstanding GlobespanVirata
Stock Options and the exercise prices thereof.    10    (ii) No bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of  GlobespanVirata having the right
to vote on any matters on which  stockholders of GlobespanVirata may vote
("GlobespanVirata Voting Debt")  are issued or outstanding.   (iii) Except
as otherwise set forth in this Section 3.1(b), as  of the date of this

pursuant to: (A) any  provision of the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws or similar  organizational document of GlobespanVirata or any
Significant Subsidiary  of GlobespanVirata or (B) except as, individually or
in the aggregate,  would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on  GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge
of  GlobespanVirata, on Conexant and its Subsidiaries following the Merger, 
subject to obtaining or making the GlobespanVirata Necessary Consents, any

other jurisdictions, and (H) such consents, approvals, orders, 
authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings the failure of  which

expected to    12    have a Material Adverse Effect on GlobespanVirata
and its Subsidiaries.  Consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations, declarations  and filings required under or in relation to any
of the foregoing clauses  (A) through (G) are hereinafter referred to as the
"GlobespanVirata  Necessary Consents".   (d) Reports and Financial
Statements.   (i) Each of GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries has filed
all  registration statements, prospectuses, reports, schedules, forms, 
statements and other documents required to be filed by it with the SEC  since
January 1, 2002 (collectively, including all exhibits thereto, the 
"GlobespanVirata SEC Reports"). No Subsidiary of GlobespanVirata is  required
to file any form, report, registration statement, prospectus or  other
document with the SEC. None of the GlobespanVirata SEC Reports, as  of their
respective dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior  to the date
of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), contained  any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material  fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not  misleading. Each of the
financial statements (including the related notes)  included in the
GlobespanVirata SEC Reports fairly presents, in all  material respects, the
consolidated financial position and consolidated  results of operations and
cash flows of GlobespanVirata and its  consolidated Subsidiaries as of the
respective dates or for the respective  periods set forth therein, all in
conformity with generally accepted  accounting principles ("GAAP")
consistently applied during the periods  involved except as otherwise noted
therein, and subject, in the case of  unaudited interim financial statements,
to normal and recurring year-end  adjustments that have not been and are not
expected to be material in  amount. All GlobespanVirata SEC Reports, as of
their respective dates (and  as of the date of any amendment to the
respective GlobespanVirata SEC  Report), complied as to form in all material
respects with the applicable  requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations promulgated thereunder.   (ii)
Except as disclosed in the GlobespanVirata SEC Reports  filed and publicly
available prior to the date hereof (the  "GlobespanVirata Filed SEC
Reports"), since June 30, 2003, GlobespanVirata  and its Subsidiaries have
not (and since April 4, 2003, the WLAN Business  has not) incurred any
liabilities that are of a nature that would be  required to be disclosed on a
balance sheet of GlobespanVirata and its  Subsidiaries or the footnotes
thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP,  other than (A) liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business  consistent with past practice or
(B) liabilities that, individually or in  the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect on GlobespanVirata and its
Subsidiaries.    13    (iii) Set forth in Section 3.1(d)(iii) of the
GlobespanVirata  Disclosure Schedule are (A) the audited balance sheets of
the WLAN  Business as at January 3, 2003, December 28, 2001 and December 29,
2000,  together with the related audited statements of operations, product
group  equity and cash flows for the fiscal years then ended, accompanied by
the  notes thereto and the report of Ernst and Young LLP, and (B) the
unaudited  balance sheet of the WLAN Business as at April 4, 2003 and the
related  unaudited statement of revenues, costs and related expenses,
depreciation  and capital expenditures for the three months then ended
(collectively,  the "WLAN Financial Information"). The WLAN Financial
Information was  derived from the internal books and records of Intersil
Corporation  ("Intersil") and was prepared in a manner consistent with
Intersil\'s then  current accounting practices with respect to the WLAN
Business. The WLAN  Financial Information is complete and accurate, is
presented in accordance  with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis throughout
the periods indicated,  and presents fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position and  the results of operations of the WLAN Business for
the periods indicated  in the manner set forth in Section 3.1(d)(iii) of the
GlobespanVirata  Disclosure Schedule, except for the omission of certain
information  required to be included in footnotes to the interim financial
statements,  which footnotes were not prepared by GlobespanVirata or
Intersil.  GlobespanVirata makes no other representations with regard to the
WLAN  Financial Information. Without limiting any of the foregoing,
Conexant  acknowledges that the WLAN Financial Information was prepared
solely for  the purpose of the WLAN Acquisition Agreement and that the WLAN
Business  was not conducted on a stand-alone basis as a separate entity
during the  periods indicated in the WLAN Financial Information and that the
WLAN  Financial Information includes allocations and estimates not
necessarily  indicative of the costs that would have resulted if the WLAN
Business had  been operated and conducted on a stand-alone basis as a
separate entity  during such periods.   (e) Information Supplied.   (i)
None of the information supplied or to be supplied by  GlobespanVirata for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in (A) the  Form S-4 will, at the
time the Form S-4 is filed with the SEC, at any time  it is amended or
supplemented or at the time it becomes effective under  the Securities Act,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or  omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary  to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which  they were
made, not misleading, and (B) the Joint Proxy  Statement/Prospectus will, on
the date it is first mailed to Conexant  stockholders or GlobespanVirata
stockholders or at the time of the  Conexant Stockholders Meeting or the
GlobespanVirata Stockholders Meeting,    14    contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any  material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make  the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they  were made, not misleading. The
Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy  Statement/Prospectus will comply as to form in
all material respects with  the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
Securities Act and the rules  and regulations of the SEC thereunder.   (ii)
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section  3.1(e), no
representation or warranty is made by GlobespanVirata with  respect to
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or  the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus based on information supplied by  Conexant or
Concentric Sub for inclusion or incorporation by reference  therein.   (f)
Board Approval. The Board of Directors of GlobespanVirata, by resolutions
duly adopted by unanimous vote of all directors present at a meeting duly
called and held and, other than as set forth in Section 5.8, not subsequently
rescinded or modified in any way, has duly (i) determined that this Agreement
and the Merger are advisable and in the best interests of GlobespanVirata and
its stockholders, (ii) approved this Agreement and the Merger, (iii) resolved
to recommend that the stockholders of GlobespanVirata approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger and directed that the Merger and this Agreement be
submitted for consideration by GlobespanVirata\'s stockholders at the
GlobespanVirata Stockholders Meeting and (iv) taken all other
action necessary to render any limitations on business combinations similar
to those contained in Section 203 of the DGCL inapplicable to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Pursuant to Article XII of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation of GlobespanVirata, the limitations on business
combinations contained in Section 203 of the DGCL do not apply to
GlobespanVirata. To the Knowledge of GlobespanVirata, no state takeover
statute is applicable or purports to be applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.   (g) Vote Required. The affirmative vote
of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of GlobespanVirata
Common Stock (the "Required GlobespanVirata Vote") to approve and adopt this
Agreement and the Merger is the only vote of the holders of any class or
series of GlobespanVirata capital stock necessary to approve or adopt this
Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.  
(h) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.   (i) Except as set forth in the
GlobespanVirata Filed SEC  Reports, there is no suit, action, proceeding or
regulatory investigation  pending or, to the Knowledge of GlobespanVirata,
threatened, against or  affecting    15    GlobespanVirata or any of
its Subsidiaries or any property or asset of  GlobespanVirata or any of its
Subsidiaries which, individually or in the  aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect  on GlobespanVirata and its
Subsidiaries, nor is there any judgment,  decree, injunction, rule or order
of any Governmental Entity or arbitrator  outstanding against GlobespanVirata
or any of its Subsidiaries which,  individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect on GlobespanVirata
and its Subsidiaries.   (ii) Except as, individually or in the aggregate,

GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries, GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries 
hold all permits, licenses, franchises, variances, exemptions, orders and 
approvals of all Governmental Entities which are necessary for the  operation
of the businesses of GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries (the

GlobespanVirata Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of  GlobespanVirata,
threatened, except for suspensions or cancellations  which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected  to have a Material
Adverse Effect on GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries.  GlobespanVirata and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of  the GlobespanVirata
Permits, except where the failure so to comply,  individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have  a Material Adverse
Effect on GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries. None of  GlobespanVirata or
any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of, and  GlobespanVirata and its
Subsidiaries have not received any notices of  violations with respect to,
any Applicable Laws, except for violations  which, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected  to have a Material Adverse

expired, except to the extent that such  failure to file, to be complete or

agreement or arrangement that limits or otherwise restricts GlobespanVirata
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates or any
successor thereto, or that would, after the Effective Time, to the Knowledge
of GlobespanVirata, limit or restrict Conexant or any of its Subsidiaries or

the occurrence of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the value of any of the benefits of which will be calculated on the basis
of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iv) any
Contract which would prohibit or materially delay the consummation of the
Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All
"material contracts" (as defined in clause (i) above) set forth in Section

GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and
effect except to the extent they have previously expired in accordance with
their terms or if the failure to be in full force and effect, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries. None of GlobespanVirata or
any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of GlobespanVirata, any other
party thereto has violated any provision of, or committed or failed to
perform any act which with or without notice, lapse of time or both would
constitute a default under the provisions of, any "material contract" (as
defined in clause (i) above) set forth in Section 3.1(p) of the
GlobespanVirata Disclosure Schedule, except in each case for those violations
and defaults which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on GlobespanVirata and its
Subsidiaries.   (q) Employee Benefits.   (i) With respect to each
GlobespanVirata Plan, except for  GlobespanVirata Plans the liabilities under
which, individually or in the  aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse

have complied with, and are now in  compliance with, all provisions of ERISA,
the Code and all other  Applicable Laws and regulations applicable to such
GlobespanVirata Plans  and each GlobespanVirata Plan has been administered in
accordance with its  terms, in each case except as would not have a Material
Adverse Effect on  GlobespanVirata and   21   its Subsidiaries. Each
GlobespanVirata Plan that is required by ERISA to  be funded is fully funded
in accordance with reasonable actuarial  assumptions, except as would not

and warrants to GlobespanVirata as follows:   (a) Organization, Standing
and Power; Subsidiaries.   (i) Each of Conexant and its Subsidiaries is a
corporation or  other organization duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing  (where applicable) under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or  organization, has the requisite power and authority to own,
lease and  operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted  and as it will be conducted through the Effective Time, except
where the  failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to
have such  power and authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not 
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Conexant and  its
Subsidiaries, and is duly qualified and in good standing to do  business in
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the  ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary,  other than in
such jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or to be  in good
standing, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably  be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Conexant and its  Subsidiaries. The
copies of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws  of Conexant which
were previously furnished or made available to  GlobespanVirata are true,
complete and correct copies of such documents as  in effect on the date of

directly or indirectly owns  any equity or similar interest in, or any

reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Conexant and
GlobespanVirata shall prepare and file with the SEC mutually acceptable proxy
materials which shall constitute the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (such

"Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus") and Conexant shall prepare and file with
the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 with respect to the issuance of
Conexant Common Stock in the Merger (the "Form S-4"). The Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus will be included in and will constitute a part of the

GlobespanVirata shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Form S-4 declared effective
by the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after filing with the SEC
and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the
Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. Conexant and
GlobespanVirata shall, as promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
provide the other party copies of any written comments and advise the other
party of any oral comments, with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 received from the SEC. The parties
shall   45    cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 prior to filing such with the
SEC, and will provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with
the SEC. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no
amendment or supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 shall be made without the
approval of both Conexant and GlobespanVirata, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided that with respect to documents
filed by a party which are incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 or Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply only with
respect to information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations; and provided, further, that Conexant, in
connection with a Change in the Conexant Recommendation, and GlobespanVirata,
in connection with a Change in the GlobespanVirata Recommendation (each of a
Change in the Conexant Recommendation and a Change in the GlobespanVirata
Recommendation being hereinafter sometimes referred to as a "Change"), may
amend or supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4
(including by incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment
to effect such a Change, and in such event, this right of approval shall
apply only with respect to information relating to the other party or its
business, financial condition or results of operations, and shall be subject
to the right of each party to have its Board of Directors\' deliberations and
conclusions accurately described. Conexant will use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Conexant\'s
stockholders, and GlobespanVirata will use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to
GlobespanVirata\'s stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act. Conexant
shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified or to file a general consent
to service of process) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the issuance of Conexant Common Stock in
the Merger and GlobespanVirata and Conexant shall furnish all information
concerning GlobespanVirata and Conexant and the holders of GlobespanVirata
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. Each of Conexant and GlobespanVirata will advise the other, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become
effective, the issuance of any stop order with respect to the Form S-4, the
suspension of the qualification of the Conexant Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or
any request by the SEC for amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus
or the Form S-4. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to Conexant or GlobespanVirata, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Conexant or
GlobespanVirata which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such  
46    documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders Conexant and
GlobespanVirata.   (b) GlobespanVirata shall duly take all lawful action to
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders on a

of obtaining the Required GlobespanVirata Vote with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall take all lawful action
to solicit the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the
Required GlobespanVirata Vote; and the Board of Directors of GlobespanVirata
shall recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the

(the "GlobespanVirata Recommendation"), and shall not (i) withdraw, modify or
qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to
Conexant the GlobespanVirata Recommendation or (ii) take any action or make
any statement in connection with the GlobespanVirata Stockholders Meeting
inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the
GlobespanVirata Recommendation"); provided, however, that the Board of
Directors of GlobespanVirata may make a Change in the GlobespanVirata
Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.8. Notwithstanding any Change in the
GlobespanVirata Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the
stockholders of GlobespanVirata at the GlobespanVirata Stockholders Meeting
for the purpose of approving and adopting this Agreement and the Merger and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve GlobespanVirata of such
obligation.   (c) Conexant shall duly take all lawful action to call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders on a date

GlobespanVirata (the "Conexant Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of

of Conexant shall recommend approval of the issuance of Conexant Common Stock
in the Merger pursuant to this Agreement by the stockholders of Conexant to
the effect as set forth in Section 3.2(f) (the "Conexant Recommendation") and
shall not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or
qualify) in any manner adverse to GlobespanVirata the Conexant Recommendation
or (ii) take any action or make any statement in connection with the Conexant
Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation (collectively, a
"Change in the Conexant Recommendation"); provided,   47    however,
that the Board of Directors of Conexant may make a Change in the Conexant
Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.8. Notwithstanding any Change in the
Conexant Recommendation, the issuance of Conexant Common Stock in the
Merger pursuant to this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of
Conexant at the Conexant Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of approving
the issuance of Conexant Common Stock in the Merger pursuant to this
Agreement and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Conexant of
such obligation.   SECTION 5.2 Conexant Board of Directors and

restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (A) any Applicable Laws or
Contract requires such party or its Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit
access to any such properties or information or (B) the information is
subject to confidentiality obligations to a third party. The parties will
hold any such information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.6(a) in
confidence in accordance with, and will otherwise be subject to, the
provisions of the non-disclosure agreement dated October 16, 2003 between
Conexant and GlobespanVirata (as it may be amended or supplemented, the

GlobespanVirata shall not affect the representations and warranties of the
other or the conditions to the respective obligations of the parties to
consummate the Merger.   (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein or in any other agreement between the parties, the obligations
of confidentiality contained herein, as they relate to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in any other agreement between the parties,
shall not apply to the federal tax structure or federal tax treatment of such
transactions, and each party (and any employee, representative or agent of
any party) may disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any
kind, the federal tax structure and federal tax treatment of each of such
transactions and all materials of any kind (including opinions and analyses)

federal tax structure. The preceding sentence is intended to cause such
transactions not to be treated as having been offered under conditions of
confidentiality for purposes of Treasury Reg. Section 1.6011-4(b)(3) (or any
successor provision), and shall be construed in a manner consistent with such
purpose. In addition, each party acknowledges that it has no proprietary or
exclusive rights to the tax structure or tax treatment of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any tax matter or tax idea related to such
transactions.   50     SECTION 5.7 Reasonable Best Efforts.   (a)
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to

advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "Required Approvals") and
(ii) taking all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain all Required
Approvals. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party
hereto agrees to make (i) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, (ii) appropriate
filings, if any are required, with any foreign regulatory authorities in
accordance with applicable competition, merger control, antitrust, investment
or similar Applicable Laws, and (iii) all other necessary filings with other

promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to such Applicable Laws or by such authorities
and to use reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and the receipt of the
Required Approvals under such other Applicable Laws or from such authorities
as soon as practicable and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment
under any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity or any private party with respect to this
Agreement so as to make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions
contemplated hereby and avoid any administrative, judicial or other action or
proceeding, including any action or proceeding by a private party, which
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond
the Termination Date. The reasonable best efforts involved in the preceding
sentence shall include (i) defending through litigation on the
merits, including appeals, any claim asserted in any such action or
proceeding, (ii) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or

relating to any such sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or
businesses, (iii) agreeing to any limitation on the conduct of  
51    Conexant (including its Subsidiaries) or GlobespanVirata (including
its Subsidiaries), or (iv) agreeing to take any other action as may be
necessary or required by a Governmental Entity or otherwise in order (x) to
obtain all necessary consents, approvals and authorizations as soon as
reasonably possible, (y) to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any suit or
proceeding, or (z) to effect the expiration or termination of any waiting
period, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the
Closing beyond the Termination Date. At the request of one party, the other
party shall agree to take any action in the two preceding sentences, provided
that any such action may be conditioned upon the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Each of Conexant and
GlobespanVirata shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section
5.7(a) to obtain all Required Approvals, use its reasonable best efforts to
(i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing
or submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform
the other party of any communication received by such party from, or given by
such party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the
"DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental
Entity and of any material communication received or given in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review
any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of
any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC or any such other
Governmental Entity or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party,
with any other Person, and to the extent appropriate or permitted by the DOJ,
the FTC or such other applicable Governmental Entity or other Person,
give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meetings and conferences.   (c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of the parties contained in Section 5.7(a) and Section 5.7(b), if
any administrative, judicial or other action or proceeding, including any
proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
any Applicable Laws, or if any statute, rule, regulation, executive order,
decree, injunction or administrative order is enacted, entered, promulgated
or enforced by a Governmental Entity which would make the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or would otherwise prohibit or
materially impair or delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby, each of Conexant and GlobespanVirata shall
cooperate in all respects with each other to avoid, contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement   52    and to have such statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, injunction or administrative order repealed,
rescinded or made inapplicable so as to permit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.7 shall
limit a party\'s right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b)
or Section 7.1(c) so long as such party has complied with its
obligations under this Section 5.7.   (d) Each of Conexant and
GlobespanVirata and shall cooperate with each other in obtaining opinions of
Chadbourne and Parke LLP, counsel to Conexant, and Ropes and Gray LLP, counsel to

Subsidiaries nor any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries
shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries\' employees, agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its

any of its Significant Subsidiaries, including any single or multi-step

made by Conexant or an affiliate thereof), and (ii) with respect to Conexant,
any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person with respect to (A) any

negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person in response
to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal by any such Person
in order to be informed with respect thereto in order to make any
determination permitted in clause (ii), if and only to the extent that, in
any such case referred to in clause (ii) or (iii), (A) its Stockholders
Meeting shall not have occurred, (B) (x) in the case of clause (ii) above, it
has received an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (for
purposes of this clause (B), references to 30% in the definition of
"Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50%) from a third
party and its Board of Directors concludes in good faith that such

clause (iii) above, its Board of Directors concludes in good faith that there
is a reasonable likelihood that such Acquisition Proposal would constitute a
Superior Proposal, (C) its Board of Directors, after consultation with

discussions or negotiations with any Person, it notifies the other parties
promptly of such inquiries, proposals or offers received by, any such
information requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations sought to
be initiated or continued with, it or any of its representatives indicating,
in connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material
terms and conditions of any inquiries, proposals or offers, and furnishes to
the other parties a copy of any such written inquiry, proposal or offer. Each

informed of the status and terms of any such inquiries, proposals or offers
and the status and terms of any such discussions or negotiations. Each of
GlobespanVirata and Conexant agrees that it will, and will cause its
officers, directors and representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the
date of this Agreement with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, and request the return or destruction of all non-
public information furnished in connection therewith. Each of GlobespanVirata

(except as specifically provided in Article VII) or (y) affect any other
obligation of GlobespanVirata or Conexant under this Agreement.

stockholders any Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.   (d) For
purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means with respect to
GlobespanVirata or Conexant, as the case may be, a bona fide written proposal
made by a Person other than either such party which is (i) for a merger,
reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving such party as
a result of which the other Person thereto or its stockholders will own 50%
or more of the combined voting power of the entity surviving or resulting
from such transaction (or the ultimate parent entity thereof), and (ii) is
not subject to any financing contingency or due diligence condition and is
otherwise on terms which the Board of Directors of such party in good faith
concludes (following receipt of the advice of its financial advisors and
outside counsel), taking into account, among other things, all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the Person making
the proposal, (x) would, if consummated, result in a transaction that is more
favorable to its stockholders (in their capacities as stockholders), from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (y) is reasonably capable of being completed.   55     SECTION 5.9
Employee Benefits Matters.   (a) Continuation and Comparability of Benefits.
From and after the Effective Time, the Conexant Plans and the GlobespanVirata
Plans in effect at the Effective Time shall remain in effect with respect to
employees and former employees of Conexant and its Subsidiaries and employees
and former employees of GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries covered by such
plans at the Effective Time (whether or not such covered employees have then
satisfied waiting periods or other preconditions to participation under such
plans) (collectively, the "Continuing Employees"), until such time as
Conexant shall determine, subject to Applicable Laws and the terms of such
plans. Prior to the Closing Date, Conexant and GlobespanVirata shall
cooperate in reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the Conexant Plans and the
GlobespanVirata Plans with a view towards developing appropriate new benefit
plans for Continuing Employees. It is the intention of Conexant and
GlobespanVirata, to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, to develop new
benefit plans, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
which, among other things, (i) treat similarly situated employees on
a substantially equivalent basis, taking into account all relevant factors
and (ii) do not discriminate between Continuing Employees who were covered
by Conexant Plans, on the one hand, and those covered by GlobespanVirata
Plans, on the other, at the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 5.9 shall
be interpreted as preventing Conexant or the Surviving Corporation from
amending, modifying or terminating any Conexant Plan or GlobespanVirata Plan
or other contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding, in accordance
with its terms and Applicable Laws.   (b) Pre-Existing Limitations;
Deductibles; Service Credit. With respect to any employee benefit plans in
which any Continuing Employees who were employees of Conexant or
GlobespanVirata (or their Subsidiaries) prior to the Effective Time first
become eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, and in which
the Continuing Employees did not participate prior to the Effective Time (the
"Post-Closing Plans"), Conexant shall: (i) waive all pre-existing conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents under any Post-Closing Plans in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such
pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods under the analogous
pre-Effective Time employee benefit plan had not been satisfied or completed
as of the Effective Time; (ii) provide each Continuing Employee and his or
her eligible dependents with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid
prior to the Effective Time under the analogous pre-Effective Time
employee benefit plan in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any Post-Closing Plans in which such employees may
be eligible to participate after the Effective Time; and (iii) recognize
all service of the Continuing Employees with Conexant and GlobespanVirata,
and their respective affiliates, for all purposes (including, without
limitation, purposes of eligibility   56    to participate, vesting
credit, entitlement to benefits, and, except with respect to defined benefit
pension plans, benefit accrual) in any Post-Closing Plan in which such
employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, to the
extent such service is taken into account under the applicable New Conexant
Plan; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would
result in duplication of benefits.   (c) ESPP. Prior to the Closing Date,
Conexant and GlobespanVirata will cooperate in developing a mutually
agreeable plan for transitioning the Continuing Employees from participation
in the GlobespanVirata ESPP to participation in the Conexant ESPP with a view
to preserving, to the extent practicable, certain mutually agreed benefits of
Continuing Employees under the GlobespanVirata ESPP and including Continuing
Employees in the Conexant ESPP as soon as practicable after termination of
the GlobespanVirata ESPP.   SECTION 5.10 Fees and Expenses. Subject to
Section 7.2(d), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all Expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such Expenses, except Expenses
incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4
and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus, which shall be shared equally by
GlobespanVirata and Conexant. As used in this Agreement, "Expenses" means all
out-of-pocket expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers, experts and consultants to a party hereto
and its affiliates) incurred by a party or on its behalf in connection with
or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the preparation, filing, printing and mailing of the Form S-4 and
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the solicitation of
stockholder approvals and all other matters related to the transactions
contemplated hereby.   SECTION 5.11 Directors\' and Officers\'
Indemnification and Insurance. Conexant shall (i) indemnify and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of expenses to, all past and present
directors, officers and employees of GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries (in
all of their capacities as such), to the same extent such persons are
indemnified or have the right to advancement of expenses as of the date of
this Agreement by GlobespanVirata pursuant to GlobespanVirata\'s certificate
of incorporation, by-laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in
existence on the date hereof with any such directors, officers and employees
of GlobespanVirata and its Subsidiaries for acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring in
connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby) and (ii) cause to be maintained for a
period of six years after the Effective Time the current policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by   57    GlobespanVirata (provided
that Conexant may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions which are, in the aggregate, no
less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts
or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time; provided, however,
that in no event shall Conexant be required to expend in any one year an
amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid
by GlobespanVirata for such insurance; and, provided, further, that if the
annual premiums for such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Conexant
shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available
for a cost not exceeding such amount.   SECTION 5.12 Public Announcements.
GlobespanVirata and Conexant each shall use reasonable best efforts to
develop a joint communications plan and each party shall use reasonable best
efforts (i) to ensure that all press releases and other public statements
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with
such joint communications plan, and (ii) unless otherwise required by
Applicable Laws or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, to consult with each other before issuing
any press release or, to the extent practicable, otherwise making any public
statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.   SECTION 5.13 Accounting Matters.   (a) GlobespanVirata shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to Conexant two letters from
GlobespanVirata\'s independent public accountants, one dated approximately
the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective and one dated the

substance reasonably satisfactory to Conexant and reasonably customary in
scope and substance for comfort letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the Form

be delivered to GlobespanVirata two letters from Conexant\'s independent
public accountants, one dated approximately the date on which the Form S-4

and GlobespanVirata, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to GlobespanVirata and reasonably customary in scope and substance for
comfort letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Form S-4.   SECTION 5.14
Listing of Shares of Conexant Common Stock. Conexant shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Conexant Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger and the shares of Conexant Common Stock to be reserved for issuance
upon exercise of the GlobespanVirata Stock Options that are  
58    converted into options to acquire Conexant Common Stock to be
approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market System, subject to
official notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.   SECTION 5.15
Affiliates. Not less than 45 days prior to the Effective Time,
GlobespanVirata shall deliver to Conexant a letter identifying all persons
who, in the judgment of GlobespanVirata, may be deemed at the time this
Agreement is submitted for approval by the stockholders of
GlobespanVirata, "affiliates" of GlobespanVirata for purposes of Rule 145
under the Securities Act and applicable SEC rules and regulations, and such
list shall be updated as necessary to reflect changes from the date hereof.
GlobespanVirata shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each person
identified on such list to deliver to Conexant not less than 20 days prior to
the Effective Time, a written agreement substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit B hereto (an "Affiliate Agreement").   SECTION 5.16 Section 16

all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of
GlobespanVirata Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
GlobespanVirata Common Stock) or acquisitions of Conexant Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Conexant Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act with respect to GlobespanVirata or Conexant to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.   SECTION 5.17
Takeover Statutes. If any "fair price", "moratorium", "control share
acquisition" or other form of antitakeover statute or regulation shall become
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Conexant and
GlobespanVirata and their respective Boards of Directors shall use all
reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as

a Material Adverse Effect on Conexant and its Subsidiaries, or (ii) which has

GlobespanVirata Stockholder  Meeting having occurred or (y) Conexant shall
terminate this  Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(g) as a result of any

transfer of immediately available funds.   (c) If:   (i) (A) (x) either

million, by  wire transfer of immediately available funds.   (d) The
parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, neither party would enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if either party fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to
this Section 7.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party
commences a suit which results in a judgment against such party for the fee
set forth in this Section 7.2, such party shall pay to the other party its
costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in

from the date such payment is required to be made until the date such payment
is actually made at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date
such payment was required to be made. The parties agree that any remedy or
amount payable pursuant to this Section 7.2 shall not preclude any other
remedy or amount payable hereunder, and shall not be an exclusive remedy, for
any willful breach of any provision of this Agreement.   SECTION 7.3
Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the stockholders of Conexant and GlobespanVirata, but, after
any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance
with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by
such stockholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.   SECTION 7.4 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their

extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of those rights.    67    ARTICLE VIII  
GENERAL PROVISIONS   SECTION 8.1 Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties
and Agreements. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and
other agreements in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to
