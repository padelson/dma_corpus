 (a) _Capital Stock of the Merger Sub._ Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock._ All shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer, the Merger Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefore.   

 (c) _Merger Consideration for Series B Preferred Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2, each share of Series B convertible preferred stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Company Series B Preferred Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $5,155.5555 per share (the "Company Series B Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Series B Preferred Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Series B Preferred Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Company Series B Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(c) upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.    ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2, each share of Company Common Stock (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.4(a) below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $11.60 per share (the "Company Common Consideration" and, together with the Company Series B Merger Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). To the extent any vesting condition or any other condition requiring forfeiture to the Company would otherwise apply to any share of Company Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, such vesting or forfeiture condition shall lapse in full as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1(d) upon the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.2, without interest.   

 (e) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Company Common Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   

 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates._    

 The procedures for exchanging certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock and/or Company Series B Preferred Stock for the applicable Merger Consideration pursuant to the Merger are as follows:   

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or promptly following the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit with EquiServe Trust Company, N.A. or another bank or trust company designated by the Buyer and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock and the holders of shares of Company Series B Preferred Stock, in each case, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through the Exchange Agent in accordance with this Section 2.2, cash in an amount which, together with the amount deposited with the Exchange Agent by the Company pursuant to Section 7.2(d), is sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) and 2.1(d) in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Company Series B Preferred Stock (the "Exchange Fund").   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate which    ##### 

  

 

immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock (each, a
"Certificate") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for
the applicable Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the applicable
Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
the provisions of this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
immediately be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock which is not registered in
the transfer records of the Company, the applicable Merger Consideration may
be paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been
paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this Section 2.2.    

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2 shall look only to the Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration without interest.   

 (e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable law, none of the Buyer, the Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock for any Merger Consideration in respect of such shares, cash or property    ##### 

  

 

delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.    

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Series B Preferred Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any other applicable state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as the case may be.   

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.   

 (h) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business, New York City time, on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock or Company Series B Preferred Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable law. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or the Buyer for any reason shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger Consideration to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Sections 2.1(c) and 2.1(d).   

 2.3 _Company Stock Options_.   

 (a) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:   

 (i) to cause the vesting of any unvested options to purchase Company Common Stock ("Company Stock Options") granted under the Companys 1989 Stock Option Plan, as amended, Amended and Restated 1998 Directors Stock Option Plan, Amended and Restated 1996 Employee Stock Option Plan, 1999 Equity Incentive Plan, Annual Retainer Compensation Plan for Directors, Voicetek Corporation 1992 Equity Incentive Plan, Voicetek Corporation 1996 Stock Option Plan, PakNetX    ##### 

  

 

Corporation 1997 Stock Plan and Commerce Soft Inc. 1997 Stock Plan (as

accelerated in full effective immediately prior to the Effective Time (it
being agreed and understood that for purposes of the Company Stock Plans, the
Buyer, the Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation shall be treated as having
refused to assume the rights outstanding under such plans or substitute
similar rights therefor);    

 (ii) subject to the conversion of each Company Stock Option as set forth in Section 2.3(a)(iii) below, to effectuate the cancellation, as of the Effective Time, of all Company Stock Options outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (without regard to the exercise price of such Company Stock Options); and   

 (iii) to cause each outstanding Company Stock Option to represent on the first Business Day following the Effective Time solely the right to receive, in accordance with this Section 2.3, a lump sum cash payment in the amount of the Option Consideration (as defined below), if any, with respect to such Company Stock Option and to no longer represent the right to purchase Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company, the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any other person or any other consideration.   

 (b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option that remains unexercised as of the Effective Time shall receive from the Buyer or the Company, in respect and in consideration of each Company Stock Option so cancelled, no later that the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, a cash payment (net of applicable withholding taxes) equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Company Common Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable), without any interest thereon (the "Option Consideration"). In the event that the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Company Common Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled at the Effective Time without payment and have no further force or effect.   

 (c) As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of Company Stock Options a letter describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Stock Options pursuant to this Section 2.3 and providing instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Stock Options.   

 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock held by a holder who is entitled to demand and has made a demand for purchase of such shares of Company Common Stock    ##### 

  

 

in accordance with Chapter 13 of the CGCL and has not voted in favor of the
approval of this Agreement (any such shares being referred to as "Dissenting
Shares" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses
such holders dissenters rights under the CGCL with respect to such shares)
shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Company
Common Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by the CGCL to a holder of Dissenting
Shares.    

 (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive Company Common Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates representing such shares.   

 (c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the CGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the CGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

The Company has obtained representations, warranties and indemnities from the transferring party relating to title to any Company Software that the Company has acquired title to in connection with any prior acquisitions.

reasonably necessary for the use, maintenance, enhancement, development
and other exploitation of such software as currently used in, or currently
under development for, the business, except for those materials where the
Companys failure to possess such materials would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The computer software, computer
firmware, computer hardware (whether general purpose or special purpose), and
other similar or related items of automated, computerized and/or software
system(s) that are used or relied on by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
the current conduct of its business is sufficient for the current needs of
such business except for any such failures to own, license, sublicense,
or possess that, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

ARTICLE VI 
 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS    

 6.1 _No Solicitation_.   

 (a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. During the Pre-Closing Period, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall cause its directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors and representatives (such directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, other advisors and representatives, collectively, "Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly:   

 (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including any proposal from or offer to the Companys shareholders) with respect to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; or   

 (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any non-public information or grant access to its properties, books and records or personnel in connection with, any Acquisition Proposal.  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may, prior to the adoption of the Company Voting Proposal only,
solely to the extent necessary for the Company Board to comply with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable law, as determined in good faith by
the Company Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a
bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal (satisfying clause (i) of
the definition thereof) received by the Company after the date of this
Agreement that the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisor could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Proposal, in each case, so long as such Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a material breach by the Company of this Section
6.1 and the Company has complied in all material respects with this Section
6.1, including Section 6.1(c), (x) furnish information with respect to the
Company to the person making such Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives
pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not materially less
restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement, (y)
participate in discussions or negotiations (including solicitation of a
revised Acquisition Proposal) with such person and its Representatives
regarding any Acquisition Proposal (but only after (I) such person enters
into a confidentiality agreement with the Company at least as restrictive as
the Confidentiality Agreement and (II) concurrently with the delivery to such
person, the Company delivers to the Buyer all such information not
previously provided to the   ##### 

  

   

Buyer), and (z) amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock; provided,
however, that the Company may only so amend or so grant a waiver or release
(i) to the extent that the Company has also previously or
concurrently amended or granted a release or waiver under any standstill or
similar agreement affecting the Buyer and its Affiliates and (ii) to the
extent necessary to permit non-public proposals to be made to the Company
Board.    

 (b) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company Board shall not:   

 (i) withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board with respect to the Merger or the Company Voting Proposal;   

 (ii) cause or permit the Company to enter into (or publicly propose that the Company enter into) any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other Contract (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or recommend or propose to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, understanding or arrangement relating to any Acquisition Proposal (or resolve or authorize or propose to agree to do any of the foregoing actions), except for a confidentiality agreement, waiver or release referred to in Section 6.1(a) entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 6.1(a) and subject to Section 6.1(c); or   

 (iii) approve, recommend or take any position other than to recommend rejection (including modifying any recommendation of rejection) of, any Acquisition Proposal.  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company may, prior to the adoption of the Company Voting Proposal only, to
the extent necessary for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary
obligations under applicable law, as determined in good faith by the Company
Board after consultation with outside counsel, in response to a Superior
Proposal received by the Company Board after the date of this Agreement, (i)
withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to the Buyer the Company
Recommendation (as defined below) (a "Change in the Company Recommendation")
and/or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal, but, in each
case, only if:    

       | (v)  |   | such Acquisition Proposal did not result from
a material breach by the Company of this Section 6.1;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
     | (w)  |   | the Company has complied in all material respects
with this Section 6.1, including Section 6.1(c);  
     ##### 

  

   

       | (x)  |   | the Company Board shall have first
provided prior written notice to the Buyer that it is prepared to effect
a Change in the Company Recommendation with respect to a Superior Proposal,
which notice shall attach the most current version of any written agreement
relating to such Superior Proposal; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
     | (y)  |   | the Buyer does not make, within two Business Days
after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial adviser, is
at least as favorable to the shareholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal.  
     

 Prior to taking any action permitted by the preceding sentence and following receipt of a confidentiality agreement executed by Buyer, the Company shall promptly (but in any event at least two Business Days prior to taking such action) notify Buyer in writing of any such action it proposes to take. The Company agrees that, during the two Business Day period prior to effecting a Change in the Company Recommendation or terminating this Agreement to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement, the Company and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with the Buyer and its Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement that are proposed by the Buyer.   

 (c) _Notices to the Buyer_. The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (but in any event within the lesser of one full Business Day and 48 hours) provide oral and written notice to the Buyer of receipt by the Company of any Acquisition Proposal, and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed of any material modifications or material developments with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, including without limitation, either copies of all written Acquisition Proposals, including draft agreements or term sheets, or summaries of the material terms thereof. Prior to taking any action permitted by Section 6.1(a) and following receipt of a confidentiality agreement executed by the Buyer, the Company shall promptly (but in any event at least one Business Day prior to taking such action) notify the Buyer in writing of any such action it proposes to take with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.   

 (d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any required disclosure to the Companys shareholders if the Company Board determines in good faith, after    ##### 

  

  

consultation with outside counsel, that such action is necessary for the
Company Board to comply with its fiduciary obligations under applicable law;
provided, however, that neither the Company nor the Company Board (nor any
committee thereof) shall (i) recommend that the shareholders of the Company
tender or exchange their shares of Company Common Stock in connection with any
such tender or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner
adverse to Buyer the Company Boards recommendation with respect to the
Merger or the Company Voting Proposal, unless in each case the requirements of
this Section 6.1 shall have been satisfied.    

 (e) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions and negotiations that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal and shall request that all confidential information previously furnished to any such third parties be promptly returned or destroyed.   

 (f) _Third Party Standstill Agreements_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any material provision of any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which the Company is a party (other than involving Buyer or its Affiliates and except as permitted by Section 6.1(a)). During such period, the Company agrees to use reasonable efforts to enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreements, including, but not limited to, seeking injunctions to prevent any breaches of such agreements to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof in a court in the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction.

Proxy Statement, the Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly
inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC

The Buyer will hold, and instruct all such officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financing sources and other Representatives to hold, any such information that is nonpublic in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.   

 6.5 _Stockholders Meeting_.   

 Subject to fiduciary obligations under applicable law, the Company, acting through the Company Board, shall take all actions in accordance with applicable law, the Company Charter Documents and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market to promptly and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as promptly as practicable the Company    ##### 

  

    

Meeting for the purpose of considering and voting upon the Company Voting
Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company, after consultation with the Buyer, may adjourn or
postpone the Company Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to
the Companys shareholders or, if as of the time for which the Company
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person
or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Company Meeting.

The Company and the Buyer shall cooperate with each other in connection with
the making of all such filings. The Company and the Buyer shall each use
their commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all

The parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals prepared for submission to a government agency in connection with an antitrust filing relating to the Merger and made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) Buyer shall not be required to agree to any consent decree or order in connection with any objections raised by the Federal Trade Commission or Department of Justice or any other governmental agency or authority or third party with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) neither Buyer nor its Affiliates shall be obligated to agree to divest or hold separate all or any portion of the assets or businesses of the Company and its subsidiaries or any of their other assets or businesses.   

 6.7 _Public Disclosure_.

case the parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to reach
mutual agreement as to the language of any such report, statement or press
release in advance of publication or (ii) except in connection with the
exercise of the Companys rights pursuant to Section 6.1 of this Agreement.
Any press release announcing the execution of this Agreement or the Closing

Company and the Buyer, and the Buyer and the Company shall consult with the
other party before issuing any other press release or otherwise making any
public statement with respect to the Merger or this Agreement.   

 6.8 _Indemnification_.   

 (a) From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements (collectively, "Costs"), incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted under the CGCL for officers and directors of California corporations and to the fullest extent set forth in the indemnification agreements between the Company and such directors or officers and in effect on the date hereof set forth in Section 6.8 of the Company Disclosure Schedule. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled, subject to applicable law, to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefore; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, to the extent then required by the CGCL, to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation is made against any Indemnified Party prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.8(a) shall continue in effect until the final disposition thereof.   

 (b) The Articles of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the Company Charter Documents, which provisions shall not be amended, modified or repealed for a period of    ##### 

  

  

six years time from the Effective Time in a manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the Effective Time,
were officers or directors of the Company, unless such amendment,
modification or repeal is required by applicable law after the Effective
Time.    

 (c) For six (6) years following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, "tail" or other insurance policies (the "DandO Tail") with respect to directors, officers and fiduciaries liability insurance covering matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the coverage applicable to directors, officers and fiduciaries of the Company as of the date hereof under the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy; provided that if such "tail" or other insurance policies are not available at a cost not greater than 200% of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof under such policy (the "Insurance Cap") (which premium the Company hereby represents and warrants is as set forth on Section 6.8(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule), then the Surviving Corporation shall be required to obtain as much coverage as is possible under substantially similar policies for such annual premiums as do not exceed the Insurance Cap.   

 (d) The Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this Section 6.8 in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this Section 6.8; provided that the Indemnified Party must provide a written undertaking to repay all expenses if it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification.   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current or former officers and directors of the Company charter, statute, by-law or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.   

 (f) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors or assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume and succeed to all the obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.   

 (g) The Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.8.    ##### 

  

  

 6.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_.   

 During the Pre-Closing Period, the Buyer shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer, of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of the Buyer and the Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer, director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   

 6.10 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16_.   

 Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) under such rule resulting from the transactions contemplated by Articles I and II of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company.   

 6.11 _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_.   

 As of the Effective Time, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall be terminated. The current Offering Period under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan shall terminate on August 15, 2005. Prior to such time, the Company shall take such actions as shall be necessary to suspend the operation of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan for the period beginning on August 16, 2005 and extending until at least the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time or (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 8.1. During the period of suspension, the Company will accept no further employee contributions under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.   

 6.12 _Employee Compensation_.   

 Except as may otherwise be agreed between the Buyer and any employee of the Company, for the three-month period immediately following the Effective Time, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to each of its employees and employees of the Surviving Corporation or their respective subsidiaries who shall have been employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the    ##### 

  

    

Effective Time ("Continuing Employees") a base salary that is no less than the
base salary of such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   

 6.13 _Accrued Personal, Sick or Vacation Time_.   

 With respect to any accrued but unused personal, sick or vacation time to which any Continuing Employee is entitled pursuant to the personal, sick or vacation policies applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, if the Buyer deems it necessary to disallow any such Continuing Employee from taking such accrued personal, sick or vacation time, the Buyer shall, to the extent required by law, cause the Surviving Corporation to pay in cash to each such Continuing Employee an amount equal to such personal, sick or vacation time; and provided, further, that the Buyer shall, to the extent required by law, cause the Surviving Corporation to pay in cash an amount equal to such accrued personal, sick and vacation time to any Continuing Employees whose employment terminates for any reason subsequent to the Effective Time.   

 6.14 _Service Credit_.   

 Following the Effective Time, the Buyer shall, to the extent permitted by any Surviving Corporation Employee Plan or underlying insurance or service provider, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Surviving Corporation to give each Continuing Employee full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries (and to the extent credited by the Company or its Subsidiaries, with any prior employer) for purposes of (a) eligibility and vesting under any Surviving Corporation Employee Plans (as defined below) and (b) determination of benefit levels under any Surviving Corporation Employee Plan, in each case for which the Continuing Employee is otherwise eligible and in which the Continuing Employee is offered participation, but except where such credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, the Buyer shall, to the extent permitted by any Surviving Corporation Employee Plan or underlying insurance or service provider, use commercially reasonable efforts to waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived under any comparable Company Employee Plan of the Surviving Corporation and recognize for purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Surviving Corporation Employee Plan" means, to the extent applicable, and other than a Company Employee Plan, any "employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA), any "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and any other written plan providing severance benefits or paid time off, for the benefit of, or relating to, any Continuing Employee.    ##### 

  

  

 6.15 _401(k) Plan_.   

 At the Buyers request, prior to the Effective Time, the Companys Board of Directors shall adopt resolutions terminating the Aspect Communications Corporation Savings and Retirement Plan (the "401(k) Plan") effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. If terminated and following such termination, the Company shall make no further contributions to the 401(k) Plan (other than contributions which relate to compensation paid for services rendered on or prior to the date of the termination of the 401(k) Plan), all participants in the 401(k) Plan shall vest 100% in their respective account balances, and the plan administrator of the 401(k) Plan shall be authorized, but not directed, to apply for a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to the termination of the 401(k) Plan. Subject to Buyers approval, which approval shall be given within five Business Days following a request by the Company for such approval or which shall be deemed given at the end of such period absent explicit non-approval communicated prior to the end of the fifth Business Day, the Company shall be entitled to communicate prior to the Effective Time with the Continuing Employees regarding the effect of such plan termination.   

 6.16 _Resignations_.   

 The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver to the Buyer at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer of the resignation, effective as of the Effective Time, of all directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries.   

 6.17 _Financing_.   

 (a) The Buyer shall, at the Buyers expense, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) fully satisfy in all material respects, on a timely basis, all terms, conditions, representations and warranties set forth in the Commitment Letters and (ii) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters. The Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Buyer than the Commitment Letters as soon as reasonably practicable but in any event at the Closing. The Buyer will furnish correct and complete copies of such executed definitive agreements to the Company promptly upon request by the Company. At the Companys request, the Buyer shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the Financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters and shall give the Company prompt notice of any material adverse change with respect to such Financings. Without limiting the foregoing, the Buyer agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) any Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason or (ii) any financing source that is a party to any Commitment Letter notifies the Buyer that such source no longer intends to either    ##### 

  

  

provide or underwrite financing to the Buyer on the material terms set forth
therein. Other than in connection with this Agreement, the Buyer shall not,
and shall cause Buyer Parent and such entitys direct and indirect
subsidiaries not to, without the prior written consent of the Company, take
any action or enter into any transaction, including any merger, acquisition,
joint venture, disposition (including the disposition of any capital stock of
any Buyer Subsidiary), lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that
would reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the
Buyers obtaining of the Financing contemplated by any Commitment Letter. The
Buyer shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, (i) the Equity
Commitment Letter in any manner adverse to the Company without the prior
written consent of the Company or (ii) any Debt Commitment Letter in any
manner that would materially impair or delay or prevent the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
of the Company. If any Commitment Letter shall be terminated or modified in a
manner materially adverse to the Buyer for any reason, the Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) obtain, and, if obtained, will
provide the Company with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides
for at least the same amount of financing as contemplated by such Commitment
Letter as originally issued; (ii) enter into definitive agreements with
respect to such new financing; and (iii) obtain funds under such agreements
to the extent necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided that the Buyer shall be under no obligation to obtain or
seek to obtain any financing commitment containing terms or funding
conditions less favorable to the Buyer or the Merger Sub than those included
in such Commitment Letter (as determined in the Buyers good faith
and reasonable discretion). In the event that, after use of Buyers
commercially reasonable efforts, Buyer is unable to obtain such new financing
as described in the immediately preceding sentence, then the Company may, in
its sole discretion, propose an alternative new financing that provides for
at least the same amount of financing as contemplated by the Commitment
Letters as originally issued on terms that are not less favorable to the
Buyer and its Affiliates than those set forth in the Commitment Letters as
originally issued (as determined in the Buyers good faith and
reasonable discretion), and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to enter into definitive agreements with respect to such alternative new
financing and obtain funds under such agreements to the extent necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event that
a new Debt Commitment Letter is executed in accordance with this Section 6.17,
then such new Debt Commitment Letter shall be the "Debt Commitment Letter"
for purposes of this Agreement.    

 (b) The Company agrees to provide the Buyer with such cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the financings contemplated by the Commitment Letters as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer, including (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions, management presentation sessions, "road shows" and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) using commercially reasonable efforts to prepare business projections and financial statements (including pro forma financial statements), (iii) assisting the Buyer in preparing offering memoranda, private    ##### 

  

  

placement memoranda and similar documents, (iv) providing and executing
documents as may reasonably be requested by the Buyer, including a
certificate or certificates of the chief financial officer of the Company
with respect to solvency and financial matters, (v) using commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain surveys and title insurance as may be
reasonably requested by the Buyer, and (vi) reasonably facilitating the
pledge of collateral. The Company shall also use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause legal counsel to provide customary legal opinions and an
independent auditor of the Company to provide any unqualified opinions,
consents or customary comfort letters with respect to its financial
statements. The Company shall allow the Buyers representatives the
opportunity to review and comment upon any such financial
statements (including pro forma financial statements) in draft form and to
allow such representatives access to the Company and supporting documentation
with respect to the preparation of such financial statements and the
independent auditors work papers relating to such financial
statements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) such requested cooperation
shall not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability in connection with the financings contemplated by the
Commitment Letters prior to the Effective Time (unless such fee or liability
is subject to the immediately succeeding sentence or such commitment fee or
liability is conditional on the occurrence of the Effective Time). The
Buyer shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and fees and expenses of counsel incurred
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation
to the extent such actions shall have been requested by the Buyer.    

 (c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make its cash and cash equivalents and the cash and cash equivalents of its domestic and foreign Subsidiaries available for deposit into the Exchange Fund at or prior to the Closing. The parties acknowledge if the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take the actions set forth on Schedule 6.17(c), or use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such actions to be taken, then the Company shall be deemed to have exerted its commercially reasonable efforts for this purpose.

 (g) The parties agree that the agreements contained in Section 8.3(b), 8.3(c), 8.3(d) and 8.3(e) and the payments contemplated thereby are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that such payments represent the damages that the party receiving the payment will incur if the conditions giving rise to such payments shall occur and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and represent the exclusive remedy of the parties in the circumstances contemplated by such payment events; provided, however, that the foregoing limitations shall not be applicable or have any effect in the case of a termination of this Agreement by reason of a willful breach by the Buyer or the Merger Sub, one the one hand, or the Company, on the other, of a representation or warranty hereunder or a willful failure of the Buyer or the Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other, to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement, in which event the parties expressly agree that the payments contemplated by Section 8.3(d) and 8.3(e), as the case may be, shall not be deemed liquidated damages and shall serve as payments towards, and not in lieu of, any other damages and legal remedies that may be available to, or asserted by, the Company    ##### 

  

    

against the Buyer and its Affiliates, or the Buyer against the Company, as the
case may be, in such circumstances.

 This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after receipt of the Required Company Shareholder Vote in favor of the adoption of the Company Voting Proposal, but, after receipt of any such Required Company Shareholder Vote, no amendment shall be made which by law requires further approval by such shareholders without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

Such extension or waiver shall not be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 Except as provided in Sections 6.8 (Indemnification), 6.12 (Employee Compensation), 6.13 (Accrued Personal, Sick or Vacation Time) and 6.14 (Service Credit), this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to (i) confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, (ii) create any agreement of employment with any person or (iii) otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.   

 9.5 _Assignment_.   

 Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and    ##### 

  

    

void; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the Buyer and the
Merger Sub may, without the consent of the Company, assign its rights,
interests and obligations under this Agreement (a) to any of their respective
Affiliates, so long as the Buyer and the Merger Sub shall remain primarily
obligated with respect any such delegated obligation, or (b) for
collateral security purposes to any lender providing financing to the Buyer,
the Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.   

 9.6 _Severability_.   

 Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity, legality or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a valid, legal and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term.   

 9.7 _Counterparts and Signature_.   

 This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by facsimile transmission.   

 9.8 _Interpretation_.   

 When reference is made in this agreement to an article or a section, such reference shall be to an article or section of this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule    ##### 

  

    

of strict construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever the
context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by any
party shall affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.   

 9.9 _Governing Law_.   

 This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of California.   

 9.10 _Remedies_.   

 Except as otherwise provided herein (including as provided in Section 8.3(g)), any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce (without the posting of a bond or other security) specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.   

 9.11 _Submission to Jurisdiction_.   

 Each of the parties to this Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of California in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that    ##### 

  

    

might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto
may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the
process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided
for the giving of notices in Section 9.2. Nothing in this Section 9.11,
however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law.   

 9.12 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_.   

 EACH OF THE BUYER, THE MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE BUYER, THE MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.   

 9.13 _Knowledge of the Company_.   

 For all purposes of this Agreement, the phrase "to the knowledge of the Company" shall mean the actual knowledge of those individuals set forth in Section 9.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.
