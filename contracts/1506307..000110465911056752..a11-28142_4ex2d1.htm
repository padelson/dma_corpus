ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Effect on Capital Stock_

 



 

SECTION 2.1. _Effect of LLC Conversion and First Merger_. At the Conversion
Effective Time, by virtue of the LLC Conversion and without any action on the
part of the holder of any shares of capital stock of the EP Surviving Company,
each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of the EP Surviving Company
shall be converted into one (1) limited liability company interest of the EP
Converted LLC. At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of common stock,
par value $3.00 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "),
each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of the Company will be
converted into one (1) share of common stock of New EP.

 



 

SECTION 2.2. _Effect of Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, by
virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger
Sub Two:

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub Two_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub Two shall be converted into and become one validly

 



       
 

 



 

issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the New EP Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the New EP Surviving Corporation. From
and after the Second Effective Time, all certificates representing the common
stock of Merger Sub Two shall be deemed for all purposes to represent the
number of shares of common stock of the New EP Surviving Corporation into
which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock, and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub
Three, shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancelled shares, and
any shares held by any other Subsidiary of Parent or the Company shall be
exchanged for the Per Share Stock Consideration (collectively, the " _Excluded
Shares_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 2.2(b)_ shall not apply
to shares of Company Common Stock held in trust or otherwise set aside from
shares held in the Companys treasury pursuant to or in respect of a Company
Benefit Plan.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Sections 2.4(h)_ ,
_2.4(i)_ and _2.6_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and
Dissenting Shares but, for the avoidance of doubt and subject to the terms and
conditions of _Section 2.5_ , including any Restricted Shares and shares of
Company Common Stock deemed to be issued under or in respect of Company Stock
Options, Company Performance RSUs and the Company ESPP (on the Last Exercise
Date) pursuant to the terms and conditions of _Section 2.5_ ) shall be
converted into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
following consideration (the " _Merger Consideration_ "):

 



 

(i) _Mixed Election Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock with respect
to which an election to receive a combination of stock and cash (a " _Mixed
Election_ ") has been effectively made and not revoked pursuant to _Section
2.2_ (each, a " _Mixed Consideration Election Share_ ") and, except to the
extent provided in _Section 2.2(e)_ , each No Election Share (as that term is
defined in _Section 2.3(b)_) shall be converted into the right to receive the
combination (which combination shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Per
Share Mixed Consideration_ ") of (x) $14.65 in cash without interest (the "
_Per Share Cash Amount_ "), (y) 0.4187 of a share of validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Class P common stock, par value $0.01 per
share of Parent (" _Parent Class P Stock_ ," and such fraction of a share, the
" _Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio_ ") and (z) 0.640 of a warrant, in the
form and on the terms specified in the form of warrant agreement attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ which Parent hereby agrees to enter into at or prior to
the Second Effective Time (each, a " _Parent Class P Warrant_ ") to purchase
one fully paid and nonassessable share of Parent Class P Stock at an exercise
price equal to $40.00 per share of Parent Class P Stock (the

 



      
 

 



 

" _Per Share Warrant Consideration_ "), in each case, subject to adjustment in
accordance with _Sections 2.2(f)_ and _2.6_.

 



 

(ii) _Cash Election Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock with respect
to which an election to receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ ") has been
effectively made and not revoked (each, a " _Cash Election Share_ ") shall be
converted (provided that the Available Cash Election Amount (as defined below)
equals or exceeds the Cash Election Amount (as defined below)) into the right
to receive (x) $25.91 in cash without interest (the " _Per Share Cash Election
Consideration_ ") and (y) the Per Share Warrant Consideration, subject to
adjustment in accordance with _Sections 2.2(c)(ii)_, _2.2(f)_ and _2.6_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if, __ (A) the product of the number of Cash
Election Shares and the Per Share Cash Election Consideration (such product
being the " _Cash Election Amount_ ") exceeds (B) the difference between (x)
the product of the Per Share Cash Amount and the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock (other than the Excluded Shares, but including, for the
avoidance of doubt, Restricted Shares, shares of Company Common Stock issued
or deemed to be issued under or in respect of Company Stock Options, Company
Performance RSUs and the Company ESPP (on the Last Exercise Date) pursuant to
the terms and conditions of _Section 2.5_ ) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the First Effective Time minus (y) the product of the number of Mixed
Consideration Election Shares (provided that No Election Shares shall be
deemed to be Mixed Consideration Election Shares for purposes of this _Section
2.2(c)(ii)_) and the Per Share Cash Amount (the " _Aggregate Mixed
Consideration Cash Amount_ ") minus (z) the Provisional Dissenters Cash Amount
(such difference being the " _Available Cash Election Amount_ "), then each
Cash Election Share shall be converted into a right to receive (1) an amount
of cash (without interest) equal to the product of (p) the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration and (q) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of which shall be the Cash
Election Amount (such fraction being the " _Cash Fraction_ "), (2) a number of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Class P Stock
equal to the product of (r) the Exchange Ratio and (s) one (1) minus the Cash
Fraction and (3) the Per Share Warrant Consideration. The " _Provisional
Dissenters Cash Amount_ " means the product of (x) the number of Dissenting
Shares and (y) the sum of the Per Share Cash Election Consideration and the
Per Share Warrant Consideration Value.

 



 

(iii) _Stock Election Shares_. Each share of Company Common Stock with respect
to which an election to receive stock consideration (a " _Stock Election_ ")
is properly made and not revoked (each, a " _Stock Election Share_ ") shall be
converted (provided that the Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the
Available Cash Election Amount), into the right to receive (x) 0.9635 shares
(the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Class P Stock and (y) the Per Share Warrant Consideration,
subject to adjustment in accordance with _Sections 2.2(c)(iii)_, _2.2(f)_ and
_2.6_ (the " _Per Share Stock_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Consideration_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Available Cash
Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock Election
Share shall be converted into the right to receive (1) an amount of cash
(without interest) equal to the amount of such excess divided by the number of
Stock Election Shares, (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Parent Class P Stock equal to the product of (x) the
Exchange Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Per
Share Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause (1) of
this paragraph and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration and (3) the Per Share Warrant Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Certificates_. As of the Second Effective Time, all such shares of
Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or
evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4(g)_
and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Class P Stock or
Fractional Parent Class P Warrants to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to _Section 2.4(h)_ or _Section 2.4(i)_ , respectively, in each case to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with _Section 2.4(c)_ , without interest.

 



 

(e) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time and which are held by a
stockholder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (such stockholders, the " _Dissenting Stockholders_ "
and such shares of Company Common Stock, the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall
not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the
fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL (and at the Second Effective Time, such Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL), unless
and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If any Dissenting
Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost such right following the Election Deadline, such holders shares shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Second Effective Time, the
Per Share Mixed Consideration payable in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ ,
without any interest thereon; _provided_ , _however_ , that each such share
shall instead be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock
Consideration if the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ is otherwise
unable to be

 



      
 

 



 

satisfied. The Company shall give Parent (A) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL and received by the Company relating to stockholders rights of appraisal
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and (B) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect
to, or settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for payment. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Section 2.4_ to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which
appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to Parent upon demand.

 



 

(f) _Tax Treatment_.

 



 

(i) If the condition set forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ is unable to be satisfied
because the Threshold Percentage (determined without regard to this sentence)
would be less than 41%, then a number of Cash Election Shares shall instead be
converted, on a pro rata basis, into the right to receive the Per Share Mixed
Consideration such that the recomputed Threshold Percentage is equal to 41%,
and

 



 

(ii) if following the adjustment set forth in clause (i) the condition set
forth in _Section 6.1(e)_ is unable to be satisfied because the Threshold
Percentage (determined without regard to this sentence) would be less than 41%
, then with respect to the Mixed Consideration Election Shares (including No
Election Shares) the Per Share Cash Amount shall be decreased, and the Mixed
Election Stock Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly increased, such that
the recomputed Threshold Percentage is equal to 41%.

 



 

(iii) The term " _Threshold Percentage_ " shall mean the quotient, expressed
as a percentage, of (x) the Total Stock Consideration, divided by (y) the sum
of (A) the Available Cash Election Amount, (B) the Aggregate Mixed
Consideration Cash Amount (excluding any portion of such amount payable to
holders of Restricted Shares as to which a valid and timely election under
Section 83(b) of the Code was not made (" _Non-Section 83(b) Restricted
Shares_ ") or with respect to shares of Company Common Stock issued or deemed
to be issued under or in respect of Company Stock Options, Company Performance
RSUs and the Company ESPP (on the Last Exercise Date) pursuant to the terms
and conditions of _Section 2.5_ ), (C) Total Stock Consideration, (D) the
Total Warrant Consideration, (E) the Provisional Dissenters Cash Amount
(excluding any portion of such amount attributable to holders of Non-Section
83(b) Restricted Shares) and (F) Transfer Taxes paid by the Company pursuant
to _Section 5.10(b)(i)_.

 



 

(iv) The term " _Total Stock Consideration_ " shall mean the product of (x)
the aggregate number of shares of Parent Class P Stock (determined after

 



      
 

 



 

giving effect to adjustment in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ ) issued to
holders of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Non-Section 83(b)
Restricted Shares or with respect to shares of Company Common Stock issued or
deemed to be issued under or in respect of Company Stock Options, Company
Performance RSUs and the Company ESPP (on the Last Exercise Date) pursuant to
the terms and conditions of _Section 2.5_ ) hereunder, and (y) $26.89.

 



 

(iv) The term " _Total Warrant Consideration_ " shall mean the product of (x)
the aggregate number of Warrants issued to holders of Company Common Stock
(other than holders of Non-Section 83(b) Restricted Shares or with respect to
shares of Company Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued under or in
respect of Company Stock Options, Company Performance RSUs and the Company
ESPP (on the Last Exercise Date) pursuant to the terms and conditions of
_Section 2.5_ ) hereunder, and (y) the Per Share Warrant Consideration Value.

 



 

SECTION 2.3. _Election Procedures_.

 



 

(a) _Election Form_. Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the anticipated
Second Effective Time (the " _Mailing Date_ "), an election form in such form
as Parent shall reasonably specify (the " _Election Form_ ") shall be mailed
to each holder of record of shares of Company Common Stock (subject to the
terms and conditions of _Section 2.5_ in respect of each holder of record of
Restricted Shares) and, subject to the terms and conditions of _Section 2.5_ ,
to each holder of record of Company Stock Options, each holder of record of
Company Performance RSUs and each participant in the Company ESPP, in each
case as of a record date that is five (5) business days prior to the Mailing
Date (the " _Election Form Record Date_ ").

 



 

(b) _Choice of Election_. Each Election Form shall permit the holder (or the
beneficial owner through customary documentation and instructions), other than
Dissenting Stockholders, to specify (i) the number of shares of such holders
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the
Per Share Mixed Consideration, (ii) the number of shares of such holders
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the
Per Share Stock Consideration, (iii) the number of shares of such holders
Company Common Stock with respect to which such holder elects to receive the
Per Share Cash Election Consideration or (iv) that such holder makes no
election with respect to such holders Company Common Stock. For the avoidance
of doubt, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that ultimately are to
be converted into the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.2_ ,
each holder of Restricted Shares, each holder of Company Stock Options and
each holder of Company Performance RSUs, and each participant in the Company
ESPP as of the Last Exercise Date, shall receive the Per Share Warrant
Consideration as part of the overall Merger Consideration paid to such holder
in respect of each share of Company Common Stock and in no event shall any
such holder be entitled to elect not to receive the Per Share Warrant
Consideration. Any shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting
Shares) with respect to which the Exchange Agent does not receive a properly
completed Election Form during the period (the " _Election Period_ ") from the
Mailing Date

 



      
 

 



 

to 5:00 p.m., New York time, on the second (2nd) business day prior to the
Second Effective Time (the " _Election Deadline_ ") shall be deemed to be No
Election Shares. Parent shall publicly announce the anticipated Election
Deadline at least five (5) business days prior to the Election Deadline. If
the Second Effective Time is delayed to a subsequent date, the Election
Deadline shall be similarly delayed to a subsequent date (which shall be the
second (2nd) business day prior to the Second Effective Time), and Parent
shall promptly announce any such delay and, when determined, the rescheduled
Election Deadline. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _No Election Share_ "
means each share of Company Common Stock for which no election to receive Per
Share Mixed Consideration, Per Share Cash Election Consideration or Per Share
Stock Consideration has been properly made and received (the " _No Election
Shares_ ") in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.3_.

 



 

(c) _New Holders_. Parent shall make available one or more Election Forms as
may reasonably be requested from time to time by all persons who become
holders or beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, Restricted Shares,
Company Stock Options or Company Performance RSUs during the Election Period,
and the Company shall provide the Exchange Agent all information reasonably
necessary for it to perform its duties as specified herein.

 



 

(d) _Revocations; Exchange Agent_. Any election shall have been properly made
only if the Exchange Agent shall have actually received a properly completed
Election Form during the Election Period. After a Cash Election, a Stock
Election or a Mixed Election is validly made with respect to any shares of
Company Common Stock, any subsequent transfer of such shares of Company Common
Stock shall automatically revoke such election. Any Election Form may be
revoked or changed by the person submitting it, by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent during the Election Period. In the event an Election Form
is revoked during the Election Period, the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Election Form shall be deemed to be No Election Shares,
except to the extent a subsequent election is properly made during the
Election Period. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and of the Election
Form, the Exchange Agent shall have reasonable discretion to determine whether
any election, revocation or change has been properly or timely made and to
disregard immaterial defects in the Election Forms, and any good faith
decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such matters shall be binding and
conclusive. None of Parent or the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be under
any obligation to notify any person of any defect in an Election Form.

 



 

SECTION 2.4. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Mailing Date, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ")
for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for Merger Consideration. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Second Effective Time, but in no event
more than five (5) business days following the Second Effective Time, Parent
will send, or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock as of the

 



      
 

 



 

Second Effective Time (and, to the extent commercially practicable, to make
available for collection by hand if so elected by such holder of record),
whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) to the Exchange Agent) in such form as the Company and Parent
may reasonably agree, including instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to
the Exchange Agent in exchange for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.4(h)_ and cash in lieu of
any fractional warrants payable pursuant to _Section 2.4(i)_.

 



 

(b) _Deposit_. At or prior to the Second Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be deposited with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, Restricted Shares, Company Stock Options
and Company Performance RSUs, shares of Parent Class P Stock (which shall be
in non-certificated book-entry form), Parent Class P Warrants (which shall be
in non-certificated book-entry form) and an amount of cash in U.S. dollars
sufficient to be issued and paid pursuant to _Section 2.2_ and _Section
2.4(h)_ , payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or other evidence of
Restricted Shares, Company Stock Options and Company Performance RSUs (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_. Following the Second Effective Time, Parent agrees to make
available to the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash in U.S.
dollars sufficient to pay any dividends and other distributions pursuant to
_Section 2.4(g)_ , any Parent Class P Stock sufficient to pay any Stock
Consideration and Parent Class P Warrants sufficient to pay any Per Share
Warrant Consideration, in each case, that may be payable from time to time
following the Second Effective Time. All cash, book-entry certificates
representing Parent Class P Stock and book-entry certificates representing
Parent Class P Warrants deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be referred to
in this Agreement as the " _Exchange Fund._ " The Exchange Agent shall,
pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration
contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this _Article II_ out of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The
Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed
by Parent; _provided_ that no such investment or losses thereon shall affect
the Merger Consideration payable to holders of Company Common Stock entitled
to receive such consideration or cash in lieu of fractional interests and
Parent shall promptly cause to be provided additional funds to the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive
such consideration in the amount of any such losses. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to,
Parent upon termination of the Exchange Fund.

 



 

(c) _Exchange_. Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof), together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly
executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be

 



      
 

 



 

required by the Exchange Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor (i) the number of shares of Parent Class P Stock (which shall be in
non-certificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is specifically
requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of
Parent Class P Stock that such holder has the right to receive, (ii) the
number of Parent Class P Warrants (which shall be in non-certificated book-
entry form unless a physical certificate is specifically requested)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of Parent Class P Warrants
that such holder has the right to receive and/or (iii) a check in the amount
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this _Article II_. The
Merger Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable (by mail or, to
the extent commercially practicable, made available for collection by hand if
so elected by the surrendering holder of a Certificate) after receipt by the
Exchange Agent of the Certificate and letter of transmittal in accordance with
the foregoing. No interest shall be paid or accrued on any Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends
and distributions payable to holders of Certificates. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate shall, after the Second Effective Time, represent for
all purposes only the right to receive such Merger Consideration.

 



 

(d) _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of the surrendered Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. If any portion
of the Merger Consideration is to be registered in the name of a Person other
than the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition to the registration thereof that the
surrendered Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and that the Person requesting such delivery of the Merger
Consideration shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar
Taxes required as a result of such registration in the name of a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Second Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common
Stock. From and after the Second Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
representing shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Second Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
or by applicable Law. If, after the Second Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent, they shall be canceled and
exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the
procedures set forth, in this _Article II_.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock nine (9)
months after the Second Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon
demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged his or her shares of Company
Common Stock for

 



      
 

 



 

the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.4_ prior to that
time shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger
Consideration in respect of such holders shares of Company Common Stock.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two, Merger
Sub Three, New EP and the Company shall not be liable to any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock for any Merger Consideration delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(g) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to shares of Parent Class P Stock issued in the Merger shall be paid
to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates are
surrendered as provided in this _Section 2.4_. Following such surrender,
subject to the effect of escheat, Tax or other applicable Law, there shall be
paid, without interest, to the record holder of the shares of Parent Class P
Stock, if any, issued in exchange therefor (i) at the time of such surrender,
all dividends and other distributions payable in respect of any such shares of
Parent Class P Stock with a record date after the Second Effective Time and a
payment date on or prior to the date of such surrender and not previously paid
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends or other distributions
payable with respect to such shares of Parent Class P Stock with a record date
after the Second Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender. For purposes of dividends or other distributions in respect of
shares of Parent Class P Stock, all shares of Parent Class P Stock to be
issued pursuant to the Merger shall be entitled to dividends pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence as if issued and outstanding as of the Second
Effective Time.

 



 

(h) _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Class P Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each
holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Second
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Parent Class P Stock (after taking into account all Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) delivered by such holder) shall
be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance with the
provisions of this _Section 2.4(h)_ , a cash payment in lieu of such
fractional shares representing such holders proportionate interest, if any,
in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced by any fees of
the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) (as so reduced, the "share
proceeds") in one or more transactions of a number of shares of Parent Class P
Stock, such number equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number of shares
of Parent Class P Stock to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ over (ii) the aggregate number of whole shares of
Parent Class P Stock to be distributed to the holders of Certificates pursuant
to _Section 2.4(c)_ (such excess being, the " _Excess Shares_ "). The parties

 



      
 

 



 

acknowledge that payment of the cash share proceeds in lieu of issuing
certificates or scrip for fractional shares was not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares. As soon as practicable after the
Second Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the holders of the
certificates representing Parent Class P Stock that would otherwise receive
fractional shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at then-prevailing prices on
the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") in the manner provided in this
_Section 2.4(h)_ and shall be executed in round lots to the extent
practicable. Until the share proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of such shares of Company Common Stock, or the
Exchange Fund is terminated, the Exchange Agent shall hold such share proceeds
in trust for the benefit of the holders of such shares of Company Common Stock
(the " _Fractional Share Proceeds_ "). The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of the Fractional Share Proceeds to which each holder of such shares
of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount
of the aggregate share proceeds comprising the Fractional Share Proceeds by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder of such shares of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of such shares of Company
Common Stock would otherwise be entitled.

 



 

(i) _No Fractional Parent Class P Warrants_. No certificates or scrip
representing fractional Parent Class P Warrants shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock converted
pursuant to the Second Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to
receive a fraction of a Parent Class P Warrant (after taking into account all
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) delivered by
such holder) shall be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.4(i)_ , a cash payment in
lieu of such fractional warrants representing such holders proportionate
interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent (reduced
by any fees of the Exchange Agent attributable to such sale) (as so reduced,
the "warrant proceeds") in one or more transactions of a number of Parent
Class P Warrants, such number equal to the excess of (i) the aggregate number
of Parent Class P Warrants to be delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent
pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)_ over (ii) the aggregate number of whole Parent
Class P Warrants to be distributed to the holders of Certificates pursuant to
_Section 2.4(c)_ (such excess being, the " _Excess Warrants_ "). The parties
acknowledge that payment of the cash warrant proceeds in lieu of issuing
certificates or scrip for fractional Parent Class P Warrants was not
separately bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent
that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional warrants. As soon
as practicable after the Second Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent
for the holders of the certificates representing Parent Class P Warrants that
would otherwise receive fractional Parent Class P Warrants, shall sell the
Excess Warrants at then-prevailing prices on the NYSE or NASDAQ, as
applicable, in the

 



       
 

 



 

manner provided in this _Section 2.4(i)_ and shall be executed in round lots
to the extent practicable. Until the warrant proceeds of such sale or sales
have been distributed to the holders of such shares of Company Common Stock,
or the Exchange Fund is terminated, the Exchange Agent shall hold such warrant
proceeds in trust for the benefit of the holders of such shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Fractional Warrant Proceeds_ "). The Exchange Agent shall
determine the portion of the Fractional Warrant Proceeds to which each holder
of such shares of Company Common Stock shall be entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate warrant proceeds comprising the
Fractional Warrant Proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of the fractional warrant interest to which such holder of such shares
of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled and the denominator of
which is the aggregate amount of fractional warrant interests to which all
holders of such shares of Company Common Stock would otherwise be entitled.

 



 

(j) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Certificate as contemplated by this _Article II_.

 



 

(k) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Merger Sub Two, Merger Sub Three and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to a holder of Company Stock Options, Company Performance
RSUs, shares of Company Common Stock (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
Restricted Shares) or a participant in the Company ESPP pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision
of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former
holder of the Company Stock Options, Company Performance RSUs, shares of
Company Common Stock (including, for the avoidance of doubt, Restricted
Shares) or the former participant in the Company ESPP, as applicable, in
respect of whom such withholding was made. If withholding is required from
shares of Parent Class P Stock or Parent Class P Warrants, Parent and the
Exchange Agent shall be treated as having sold such consideration for an
amount of cash equal to the fair market value of such consideration at the
time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing
authority.

 



 

SECTION 2.5. _Treatment of Stock Options, Restricted Shares, Company
Performance RSUs and Company ESPP_. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Second
Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering any Company Stock Plan or the Company ESPP) will adopt
resolutions, and the Company will take all

 



      
 

 



 

other actions as may be necessary or required in accordance with applicable
Law, each Company Stock Plan (including, the award agreements in respect of
awards granted thereunder) and the Company ESPP to give effect to this
_Section 2.5_ to provide that:

 



 

(a) _Treatment of Company Stock Options_. Each Company Stock Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time (whether or not
then vested or exercisable), by virtue of the occurrence of the Closing and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Stock Option, will
be deemed exercised pursuant to a cashless exercise for that number of shares
of Company Common Stock (the " _Net Exercise Shares_ ") equal to, rounded down
to the nearest whole share, (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Second Effective
Time minus (ii) the number of whole and partial (computed to the nearest four
decimal places) shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option which, when multiplied by the Fair Market Value (as such term is
defined in the applicable Company Stock Plan) of a share of Company Common
Stock as of immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, is equal to the
aggregate exercise price of such Company Stock Option. Each Net Exercise Share
shall, subject to the terms and conditions of _Section 2.5(d)_ , be deemed to
be an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for purposes of _Sections
2.2(c)_ and _2.3_ ; _provided_ , that, subject to the terms and conditions of
_Section 2.5(d)_ , only a Mixed Election or Cash Election may be made in
respect of such share.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Each Restricted Share that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall, as of the Second
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, vest and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse, and each
Restricted Share shall, subject to the terms and conditions of _Section
2.5(d)_ , be treated as an outstanding share of Company Common Stock for
purposes of this _Article II_ ; provided that, subject to the terms and
conditions of _Section 2.5(d)_ , only a Mixed Election or Cash Election may be
made in respect of such share.

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. Each Company restricted stock unit
that is subject to vesting based on the achievement of performance conditions
(" _Company Performance RSU_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Second Effective Time will, effective immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time, vest based on a target payout percentage of 100%, and the
shares of Company Common Stock deemed to be issued in settlement thereof
shall, subject to the terms and conditions of _Section 2.5(d)_ , be treated as
an outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for purposes of _Sections
2.2(c)_ and _2.3_ ; provided that, subject to the terms and conditions of
_Section 2.5(d)_ , only a Mixed Election or Cash Election may be made in
respect of such shares.

 



 

(d) _One Election with Respect to Company Equity Awards_. Each holder of
record of any Company Stock Options, Company Performance RSUs or Restricted
Shares or participant in the Company ESPP who receives an Election Form
pursuant to _Section 2.3_ shall, notwithstanding anything in _Section 2.3_ to
the contrary, be

 



      
 

 



 

permitted to make either a Mixed Election or Cash Election pursuant to
_Sections 2.2_ and _2.3_ with respect to all (but not less than all) shares of
Company Common Stock issued or deemed to be issued under or in respect of such
holders aggregate Company Stock Options, Company Performance RSUs, Restricted
Shares and rights under the Company ESPP (as of the Last Exercise Date), as
applicable, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this _Section 2.5_. For
the avoidance of doubt, all terms and conditions of this Article II (except
that _Section 2.2(e)_ shall apply only to shares of Company Common Stock that
are actually issued) not otherwise contradicted by this _Section 2.5_ shall
apply with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock issued or deemed to
be issued under or in respect of such holders aggregate Company Stock
Options, Company Performance RSUs, Restricted Shares and participation in the
Company ESPP, as applicable.

 



 

(e) _Company ESPP_. The Company ESPP will continue to be operated in
accordance with its terms and past practice for the Offering Period (as
defined in the Company ESPP) in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Current Offering Period_ ") and any subsequent Offering Period that begins
after the date of this Agreement pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Company ESPP; provided, that if the Second Effective Time occurs prior to the
end of the Current Offering Period or any such subsequent Offering Period, the
Company will take all action as may be necessary to shorten the Current
Offering Period or such subsequent Offering Period so that (i) the Change of
Control Exercise Date (as defined in the Company ESPP) shall occur prior to
the Second Effective Time (the " _Last Exercise Date_ ") and (ii) the Current
Offering Period or such subsequent Offering Period ends on the Last Exercise
Date. The Company will, pursuant to, and in accordance with, the terms of the
Company ESPP, notify each Company ESPP participant in writing at least ten
(10) Trading Days (as defined in the Company ESPP) prior to the Last Exercise
Date, and by a date that is no later than the Mailing Date, that the last date
during the Current Offering Period or such subsequent Offering Period on which
a deemed purchase of shares of Company Common Stock shall occur has been
changed to the Last Exercise Date and that his or her deemed purchase right
will be exercised automatically on the Last Exercise Date, unless prior to
such date, he or she has canceled his or her election to participate in the
Current Offering Period, to the extent applicable. Each share of Company
Common Stock deemed to be purchased in connection with the application of this
_Section 2.5(e)_ shall be deemed to be an outstanding share of Company Common
Stock for purposes of _Section 2.2(c)_ and _2.3_ ; _provided_ , that, subject
to the terms and conditions of _Section 2.5(d)_ , only a Mixed Election or
Cash Election may be made in respect of such share.

 



 

(f) _Notices_. Prior to the Second Effective Time, the Company shall deliver
to the holders of the Company Stock Options, Company Performance RSUs and
Restricted Shares and the participants in the Company ESPP notices, in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, setting forth such holders
rights pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Termination of Stock Plans_. Prior to the Second Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate all of its Company Stock
Plans and the Company ESPP, such termination to be effective at the Second
Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

After the Second Effective Time, all Company Stock Plans and the Company ESPP
shall be terminated and no further Company Stock Options or other rights with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock shall be granted thereunder.

 



 

SECTION 2.6. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article II_
to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in _Section
5.2_ ), if between the date of this Agreement and the Second Effective Time
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Parent Class P Stock shall
have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by
reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction (other than upon the conversion of any shares of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with the Parent Charter Documents as in effect on the date
of this Agreement), the Merger Consideration, the Per Share Cash Amount, the
Per Share Cash Election Consideration, the Per Share Stock Consideration, the
Mixed Election Stock Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Warrant Consideration, the
Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent item, as the case may be,
shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, split, combination, exchange of
shares or similar transaction and to provide the holder of share of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event.

face of the Company Disclosure Schedule that such disclosure is applicable to
such other section notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross
reference thereto and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in such Company

would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (b)

prior to the date of this Agreement, the relevance of such disclosure being

applicable power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties

in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (" _Company
Material Adverse Effect_ ").

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to
do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature
of the business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties

SECTION 3.5. _Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all required
reports, schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration,
proxy and other statements with the SEC since December 31, 2009 (collectively
and together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in
each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective effective dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents that
are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the
Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of
all other Company SEC Documents), the Company SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Company
SEC Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective
dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances

 



      
 

 



 

under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement,
there are no outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff
with respect to the Company SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of the Company,
none of the Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or
investigation.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents, including, without limitation, the audited financial
statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008, 2009
and 2010, comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of
which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 



 

(c) The Company has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer
and its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms. The Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (x) all
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls which
could adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data and have identified for the Companys auditors any
material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in the Companys internal controls. The principal executive officer and
the principal financial officer of the Company have made all certifications
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any related rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the Company SEC Documents,
and the statements contained in such certifications are complete and correct.
The management of the Company has completed its assessment of the
effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-

 



       
 

 



 

Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2010, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are
no facts or circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations
required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred since the Balance

obligations incurred under or in accordance with this Agreement or in
connection with the Transactions, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not
accrued or contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved
against on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance
with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than as have not and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in the Companys published
financial statements or any Company SEC Documents.

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are in full
force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and effect

Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the Company Permits is pending

condition has occurred or exists which would result in a violation of, breach,
default or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries under, any Company Permit, or has caused
(or would cause) an applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to
issue, renew, extend, any Company Permit (in each case, with or without notice

respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to

its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP, (iii) the U.S. consolidated federal

Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP, (vii) none of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been a "controlled corporation" or a

of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code)

Subsidiaries has timely withheld and paid all Taxes required to have been

avoidance of doubt, other than such a limitation arising as a result of the
transactions contemplated herein) that will have a material adverse impact on
the ability of the Company and the members of its affiliated group to utilize
their net operating losses, net capital losses and credit carryforwards, taken

IRS Form 4562 and all attachments and supporting statements relating thereto

on _Section 3.10(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ which does not give
effect to any deductions of net operating losses and any bonus depreciation
deductions, and (iii) assumes that no action will be taken to elect out of any
entitlement of the Company to "bonus" depreciation deductions for U.S. federal
income tax purposes with respect to the year ending December 31, 2011 (such
estimate, the " _Signing Estimated NOL_ ").

security, unemployment, excise, severance, stamp, occupation, property and

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, no action, dispute, suit, claim,
arbitration, or legal, administrative or other proceeding or governmental
action is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened (x) with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan (other than a "multiemployer plan" (within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "))

established thereunder or in connection therewith by the due date thereof.

 



 

(f) Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, the consummation of the Transactions will not, either
alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former
employee, consultant or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay, retention bonuses, parachute payments, non-competition
payments, unemployment compensation or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any
such employee, consultant or officer, (iii) result in any forgiveness of
indebtedness or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any such employee,

result of the imposition of taxes under Section 280G, Section 4999 or Section

under applicable Law; (iii) each Company Foreign Benefit Plan required to be
funded and/or book reserved is funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, in
accordance with applicable Law; (iv) all employer and employee contributions
to each Company Foreign Benefit Plan required by applicable Law or by the

market value of the assets of each funded Company Foreign Benefit Plan, the
liability of each insurer for any Company Foreign Benefit Plan funded through
insurance or the book reserve established for any Company Foreign Benefit
Plan, together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or
provide for the accrued benefit obligations, as of the Second Effective Time,
with respect to all current or former participants in such plan according to
the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine
employer contributions to such Company Foreign Benefit Plan.

intent of any Governmental Authority responsible for the enforcement of labor,
employment, occupational health and safety or workplace safety and
insurance/workers compensation laws to conduct an investigation of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no such
investigation is in progress. Except for such matters which would not have,

its Subsidiaries has any liabilities under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Act of 1998 (the " _WARN Act_ ") as a result of any action taken by
the Company that would have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Except for such non-compliance which would not have,

Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable Laws
respecting employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of

non-U.S. jurisdiction, that cover any employees of the Company or any
Subsidiary or to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or otherwise

The factual, non-interpretative data relating to the Upstream Assets on which
the Reserve Report was based are, to the Knowledge of the Company, accurate
and complete in all material respects as of the date of the Reserve Report.
The Reserve Report conforms in all material respects to the guidelines with
respect thereto of the SEC.

 



 

(b) The Companys (and any relevant Subsidiaries) internal proved reserve
estimates prepared by management for the year ended December 31, 2010 as
provided in the Companys Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, were
not, taken as a whole, materially lower than the conclusions in the Reserve
Report as of December 31, 2010. Except for changes in Law (or interpretations
thereof) or changes generally affecting the oil and gas exploration,
development and production industry (including changes in commodity prices)

attributable to the Companys (or any Subsidiarys) interest in the Upstream
Assets at some future time without receiving payment therefor at or after the
time of delivery. _Section 3.23(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ lists
all material production, transportation, plant, or other imbalances and
overlifts with respect to production from the Oil and Gas Assets in excess of

any balancing area pursuant to any balancing agreement.

 



 

(b) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, and with respect to Material Upstream Asset Groups
only, all currently-producing wells and material equipment are in an operable
state of repair, adequate to maintain normal operations in accordance with
past practices, ordinary wear and tear excepted. _Schedule 3.23(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth the lease expirations with respect to
any Material Upstream Asset Group (whether in whole or in part) that are

Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries have such title to
the Upstream Assets, which (i) entitles the Company or its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, to receive (after satisfaction of all royalties, overriding
royalties, nonparticipating royalties, net profits interests, or other similar
burdens on or measured by production), not less than the net revenue interest
share shown in the Reserve Report of all hydrocarbons produced from an
Upstream Asset throughout the life of such Upstream Asset; (ii) obligates the
Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to bear a percentage of the costs
and expenses for the maintenance and development of, and operations relating

and proportionate increase in the net revenue interest for such Upstream
Asset; and (iii) is free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, obligations, or
defects. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company

breach of, or default under, any oil and gas lease, oil, gas, and mineral
lease and sublease, royalty, overriding royalty, net profits interest, mineral
fee interest, carried interest, interests under a concession, production
sharing, risk service, technical service, service, or similar agreement that
is, or constitutes an interest in, a Material Upstream Asset Group.

Three of this Agreement, and the consummation by Parent, Merger Sub Two and
Merger Sub Three of the Transactions, have been duly authorized and approved
by the Parent Board and the board of directors of Merger Sub Two and the sole
member of Merger Sub Three (and prior to the Second Effective Time will be
adopted by Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub Two and the sole
member of Merger Sub Three) and, except for obtaining the Parent Stockholder
Approval, no other action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub
Three is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance by
Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three of this Agreement and the
consummation by them of the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent,
Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three, enforceable against each of them in

(b) The Parent Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) approved and
declared advisable this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Share
Issuance (as defined below) and (ii) resolved to recommend that stockholders
of Parent approve the Share Issuance.

 



 

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent, Merger Sub
Two and Merger Sub Three, nor the consummation by Parent, Merger Sub Two and
Merger Sub Three of the Transactions, nor compliance by Parent, Merger Sub Two
and Merger Sub Three with any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement,
will (i) conflict with or violate any provision of the Parent Charter
Documents or any of the Parent Subsidiary Documents or (ii) assuming that the

under, accelerate the performance required by, or result in the creation of
any Lien upon any of the respective properties or assets of, Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any
Contract to which Parent or any of its respective Subsidiaries is a party, or
by which they or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound or
affected except, in the case of clauses (x) and (y), for such violations,
conflicts, losses, defaults, terminations, cancellations,

 



      
 

 



 

accelerations or Liens as, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(d) The affirmative vote (in person or by proxy) of the holders of a majority
of the aggregate voting power cast at the Parent Stockholders Meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof to approve the issuance of shares of
Parent Class P Stock (including shares of Parent Class P Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Parent Class P Warrants issued in the Second Merger) and the
Parent Class P Warrants (the " _Share Issuance_ ") in connection with the
Second Merger (the " _Parent Stockholder Approval_ ") is the only vote of the
holders of any class or series of the capital stock of Parent necessary to
approve the issuance of shares of Parent Class P Stock (including shares of
Parent Class P Stock issuable upon exercise of the Parent Class P Warrants
issued in the Second Merger) and the Parent Class P Warrants in connection
with the Second Merger and the Transactions and to approve and consummate the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement. At all times until the Parent
Stockholder Approval is obtained, the shares of capital stock of Parent
subject to the Voting Agreement are, and will be, sufficient to obtain the

purchase or acquire any such shares of capital stock, voting securities or
equity interests or any securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable or
exercisable for, or evidencing the right to subscribe for, any such shares of
capital stock, voting securities or equity interests. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub Two and Merger Sub is not, nor at any time during the last three (3) years
has been, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203
of the DGCL.

 



 

SECTION 4.4. _Governmental Approvals_. Except for (i) the filing of the Joint

with other applicable requirements of, the Exchange Act, and the rules of the
NYSE, (ii) the Delaware Filings, (iii) filings required under, and compliance

with, any Governmental Authority are necessary for the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement by Parent and the consummation by Parent of the
Transactions, other than such other consents, approvals, filings, declarations
or registrations that, if not obtained, made or given, would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to (A) prevent or materially

 



       
 

 



 

impede, interfere with or hinder the consummation of the Transactions or (B)
result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

SECTION 4.5. _Parent SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 



 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries have filed and furnished all required reports,
schedules, forms, certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and
other statements with the SEC since November 23, 2010 (collectively and
together with all documents filed on a voluntary basis on Form 8-K, and in
each case including all exhibits and schedules thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). As of
their respective effective dates (in the case of the Parent SEC Documents that
are registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the
Securities Act) and as of their respective SEC filing dates (in the case of
all other Parent SEC Documents), the Parent SEC Documents complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities
Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Parent
SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents as of such respective
dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or
unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to the Parent SEC
Documents. To the Knowledge of Parent, none of the Parent SEC Documents is the
subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

 



 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC
Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC
with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the notes thereto)
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments, none of
which has been or will be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole).

 



 

(c) Parent has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that material information relating to
Parent, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to Parents principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that
it files or submits

 



      
 

 



 

under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Parents principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on
their most recent evaluation, to Parents auditors and the audit committee of
Parent Board (x) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls which could adversely affect Parents ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for Parents
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal controls. The principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of Parent have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Parent SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are
complete and correct. The management of Parent has completed its assessment of
the effectiveness of Parents internal control over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the year ended December 31, 2010, and such assessment concluded that such
controls were effective. To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no facts or
circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 



 

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet
of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date (including the
notes thereto) included in the Parent SEC Documents filed by Parent and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities
and obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the Transactions, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any
nature (whether or not accrued or contingent), that would be required to be
reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance sheet of Parent
prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than as have not
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(e) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any " _off-balance sheet arrangements_ " (as defined in
Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, Parent in Parents published financial
statements or any Parent SEC Documents.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 4.6. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

have not been any changes, effects, events or occurrences that, individually
or in the aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) From the date of this Agreement there have not been any events, changes,
effects, events or occurrences that, individually or in the aggregate, have
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Since the Balance Sheet Date (i) Parent and its Subsidiaries have carried
on and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any action described in _Section
5.2(b)_ that if taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Second
Effective Time without the prior written consent of Parent would violate such
provision.

 



 

SECTION 4.7. _Legal Proceedings_. There are no (i) investigations or
proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) by any
Governmental Authority with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
(ii) actions, suits or proceedings pending (or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened) against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective properties at law or in equity before, and there are no orders,
judgments or decrees of any Governmental Authority against Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, in each case of clause (i) or (ii), which would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect.

 



 

SECTION 4.8. _Compliance With Laws; Permits_.

 



 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and since the later of December 31, 2009
and their respective dates of formation or organization have been, in
compliance with and are not in default under or in violation of any applicable
Laws, except where such non-compliance, default or violation would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all franchises, tariffs,
grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, variances, exceptions,
consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets or to carry on their businesses as they are now being
conducted (the " _Parent Permits_ "), except where the failure to have any of
Parent Permits would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits are in full force and effect,
except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension or cancellation of any of Parent Permits is pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened, except where such suspension or cancellation
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Material Adverse Effect. Parent and its Subsidiaries are not, and since
December 31, 2008 have not been, in violation or breach of, or default under,
any Parent Permit, except where such violation, breach or default would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of
the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of Parent, no event or condition
has occurred or exists which would result in a violation of, breach, default
or loss of a benefit under, or acceleration of an obligation of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries under, any Parent Permit or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew or extend
any Parent Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or
both), except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses, accelerations or
failures that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

SECTION 4.9. _Information Supplied_. Subject to the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in _Section 3.9_,
none of the information supplied (or to be supplied) in writing by or on
behalf of Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in

supplements thereto, are filed with the SEC or at the time it becomes

fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, and (b) the Joint
Proxy/Information Statement will, on the date it is first mailed to

Parent Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading. The Joint Proxy/Information Statement (except for such portions
thereof that relate only to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company) will
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no
representation or warranty with respect to information supplied by or on
behalf of the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any of
the foregoing documents.

or in connection therewith by the due date thereof.

 



 

(f) Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, the consummation of the Transactions will not, either
alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former
employee,

 



      
 

 



 

consultant or officer of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay,
retention bonuses, parachute payments, non-competition payments, unemployment
compensation or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or

Code pursuant to any agreement or arrangement with Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

applicable Laws of any controlling Governmental Authority; (ii) each Parent
Foreign Benefit Plan required to be registered has been registered (and where

with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the
accrued benefit obligations, as of the Second Effective Time, with respect to
all current or former participants in such plan according to the actuarial
assumptions and valuations most recently used to determine employer
contributions to such Parent Foreign Benefit Plan.

employment, occupational health and safety or workplace safety and
insurance/workers compensation laws to conduct an investigation of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no such investigation

Parent nor any Subsidiary is subject to any obligation to inform and/or
consult with any labor union, labor organization, works council or any other
employee representative body in connection with this Agreement, the
arrangements proposed in this Agreement and/or the Closing (whether under
applicable Law or any written agreement).

Contracts_ ").

 



 

(b) (i) Each Parent Material Contract is valid and binding on Parent and any
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and is in full force and effect, except
where the failure to be valid, binding and in full force and effect, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, (ii) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material respects
performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under each
Parent Material Contract, except where such noncompliance, either individually
or in the aggregate, would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and

obligations owing by the property owner (with respect to the owned real

leases, any existing material default by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or,

in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each
of Parent and its Subsidiaries has fulfilled and performed all its obligations
with respect to such rights-of-way which are required to be fulfilled or
performed as of the date of this Agreement (subject to all applicable waivers,
modifications, grace periods and extensions) and no event has occurred that
allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow, revocation or
termination thereof or would result in any impairment of the rights of the
holder of any such rights-of-way, except for such revocations, terminations
and impairments that do not materially adversely affect the commercial use of
the property for the purposes for which the property is currently being used
and except for rights reserved to, or vested in, any municipality or other

Parent.

 



 

SECTION 4.17. _Insurance_. Parent and its Subsidiaries maintain, or are
entitled to the benefits of, insurance covering their properties, operations,
personnel and businesses in amounts customary for the businesses in which they

various assumptions and qualifications set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration to be paid by Parent is fair, from a financial point of view, to
Parent (the " _Parent Fairness Opinions_ "). A correct and complete copy of
the form of the Parent Fairness Opinions has been made available to the
Company. Parent has been authorized by the Parent Financial Advisors to permit
the inclusion of the Parent Fairness Opinions and/or references thereto in the
Joint Proxy/Information Statement.

 



 

SECTION 4.19. _Brokers and Other Advisors_. Except for the Parent Financial
Advisors, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, no broker,
investment banker or financial advisor is entitled to any brokers, finders
or financial advisors fee or commission, or the reimbursement of expenses, in
connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

SECTION 4.20. _State Takeover Statutes; No Rights Plan_. The action of Parent
Board in approving this Agreement and the Transactions is sufficient to render
inapplicable to this Agreement and the Transactions the restrictions on "
_business combinations_ " (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) as set forth
in Section 203 of the DGCL. There is no stockholder rights plan in effect, to
which Parent is a party or otherwise bound.

 



 

SECTION 4.21. _Reorganization Treatment_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates has taken or agreed to take any action or knows of any facts or
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to prevent the (i) the First
Merger and the LLC Conversion, taken together, and (ii) the Second Merger and
the Third Merger, taken together, from each qualifying as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 4.22. _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a complete and correct copy of a fully
executed commitment letter from the financial institution(s) named therein
(including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes to such letters as and to the
extent delivered to the Company on or prior to the date of this Agreement, the
" _Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which such financial institutions
(including any financial institutions providing Alternative Financing or
Replacement Debt Financing, the " _Financing Sources_ ") have committed, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to provide the debt
financing described therein in connection with the Transactions. The Debt
Commitment Letter and any other debt commitment letter (including any
replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter in connection with any Alternative
Financing or Replacement Debt Financing) executed in accordance with _Section
5.14_, as replaced, amended, supplemented, modified or waived in accordance
with _Section 5.14_, including all exhibits, schedules, and annexes to such
letters, are hereinafter referred to together as the " _Debt Commitment
Letters._ " The financing contemplated pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letters
is hereinafter referred to as the " _Debt Financing._ "

 



 

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letters are in full
force and effect and are legal, valid and binding obligations of Parent, and
to the knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, and enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms against Parent, and to the knowledge of
Parent, each of the other parties thereto. All commitment fees required to be
paid under the Debt Commitment Letters have been paid in full or will be duly
paid in full as and when due, and Parent and Merger Sub have otherwise
satisfied all of the other items and conditions required to be satisfied by
them pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters on or prior to the
date of this Agreement. None of the Debt Commitment Letters have been amended,
modified or terminated on or prior to the date of this Agreement, no such
amendment, modification or termination is contemplated as of the date of this
Agreement and no Debt Commitment Letter will be amended or modified as of the
Second Effective Time except as consistent with _Section 5.14_. As of the
date of this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute a breach or default by Parent or
Merger Sub under any Debt Commitment Letter. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub is,
as of the date of this Agreement, aware of any fact, occurrence or condition
that makes any of the assumptions or statements set forth in any Debt
Commitment Letter inaccurate (assuming the accuracy of the Companys
representations and warranties), in any material respect or that would cause
the commitments provided in the Debt Commitment Letter to be terminated or
ineffective or any of the conditions contained therein not to be met. The
consummation of the Debt Financing is subject to no conditions precedent other
than those expressly set forth in the copies of the Debt Commitment Letters
delivered to the Company, and there are no contingencies that would permit the
Financing Sources to reduce the total amount of the Debt Financing other than
those expressly set forth in the copies of the Debt Commitment Letters
delivered to the Company. Except for fee letters relating to fees with respect
to the Debt Financing

 



      
 

 



 

(redacted copies of which, removing only certain fee and market "flex"
provisions, have been provided to the Company), there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the funding of the Debt
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters
delivered to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement. As of the date
of this Agreement, assuming no breach by the Company of its representations
and warranties under this Agreement (and cooperation and assistance by the
Company as provided herein) and no breach or default by the Company of its
obligations under this Agreement in either case such that the condition set
forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ would fail to be satisfied, and based upon facts
and events known by Parent as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the
Debt Financing will not be satisfied or the Debt Financing will not be
consummated as contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters on or prior to the
Closing Date. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
the Company set forth in this Agreement and performance by the Company of its
obligations under _Section 5.2(a)_, the aggregate proceeds of the Debt
Financing, together with any cash or cash equivalents held by Parent, as of
the Second Effective Time, will be sufficient to enable them to pay in cash
all amounts required to be paid by them in connection with the Transactions,
including the Merger Consideration (and the treatment of Stock Options,
Restricted Shares, Company Performance RSUs and Company ESPP pursuant to
_Section 2.5_) and all payments, fees and expenses payable by them related to
or arising out of the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(c) In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the Debt Financing) by Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Affiliates or any other financing be a
condition to any of Parents or Merger Subs obligations hereunder.

 



 

SECTION 4.23. _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 



 

(a) Except for the representations and warranties set forth in this _Article
IV_, neither Parent nor any other Person makes or has made any express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to Parent or with respect to
any other information provided to the Company, Merger Sub One or New EP in
connection with the Transactions. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither Parent nor any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability or other obligation to the Company, Merger Sub One, New EP or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to the Company, Merger Sub One or
New EP (including their Representatives), or the Companys, Merger Sub Ones
or New EPs (or such Representatives) use of, any such information, including
any information, documents, projections, forecasts of other material made
available to the Company, Merger Sub One or New EP in certain "data rooms" or
management presentations in expectation of the Transactions.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three has conducted its own
independent review and analysis of the business, operations, assets,
liabilities, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and acknowledges that each of Parent,
Merger Sub Two and

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub Three has been provided access for such purposes. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, in
entering into this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub
Three has relied solely upon its independent investigation and analysis of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, and each of Parent, Merger Sub Two and
Merger Sub Three acknowledges and agrees that it has not been induced by and
has not relied upon any representations, warranties or statements, whether
express or implied, made by the Company, any Company Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective affiliates, stockholders, controlling persons or Company
representatives that are not expressly set forth in this Agreement, whether or
not such representations, warranties or statements were made in writing or
orally. Each of Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three acknowledge and
agree that, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth
in this Agreement (i) the Company does not make, or has not made, any
representations or warranties relating to itself or its business or otherwise
in connection with the Transactions and each of Parent, Merger Sub Two and
Merger Sub Three are not relying on any representation or warranty except for
those expressly set forth in this Agreement, (ii) no Person has been
authorized by the Company to make any representation or warranty relating to
itself or its business or otherwise in connection with the Transactions, and
if made, such representation or warranty must not be relied upon by Parent,
Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three as having been authorized by such party
and (iii) any estimates, projections, predictions, data, financial
information, memoranda, presentations or any other materials or information
provided or addressed to Parent, Merger Sub Two, Merger Sub Three or any of
their representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be or include
representations or warranties unless any such materials or information is the
subject of any express representation or warranty set forth in Article III of
this Agreement.

SECTION 5.3. _No Solicitation by the Company; Etc._

 



 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable
best efforts to cause the Companys and its Subsidiaries respective
directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial advisors,
attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
discussions or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to a Takeover Proposal, and request the return or destruction of all
confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on behalf
of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Except as permitted by this _Section
5.3_, (x) the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) or knowingly induce or take any
other action designed to lead to any inquiries or proposals that constitute,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, the submission of a Takeover
Proposal, (ii) except for a confidentiality agreement permitted pursuant to
_Section 5.3(b)_, enter into any confidentiality agreement, merger agreement,
letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase agreement, asset
purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other

Agreement_ "), or (iii) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to

Recommendation or publicly recommend the approval or adoption of, or publicly
approve or adopt, or propose to publicly recommend, approve or adopt, any
Takeover Proposal and (y) within five (5) business days of receipt of a
written request of Parent, the Company shall, publicly reconfirm the Company
Board Recommendation; _provided_ , that, in the event that Parent requests
such public reconfirmation of the Company Board Recommendation, then Parents
request must be reasonable (in terms of number and timing) and the Company may
not unreasonably withhold, delay (beyond the five (5) business day period) or
condition the public reconfirmation of the Company Board Recommendation (the
taking of any action described in clause (x)(iii) or the failure to take the
action described in clause (y) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by the Companys Subsidiaries
or Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by
the Company.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to obtaining the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Stockholder Approval (but in no event after obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval), (i) the Company has received a written Takeover
Proposal that the Company Board believes is _bona fide_ , (ii) the Company
Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal and
(iii) such Takeover Proposal did not result from a material breach of this
_Section 5.3_, then the Company may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below,
(A) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to
the Person making such Takeover Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such Takeover Proposal; _provided_ , that (x) the
Company will not, and will use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives not to, disclose any non-public information to such Person
unless the Company has, or first enters into, a confidentiality agreement with
such Person with confidentiality provisions that are not less restrictive to
such Person than the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are to Parent
( _provided_ , that such confidentiality agreement need not include
"standstill" provisions or restrictions of the type contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement) and that would not prohibit compliance by the
Company with the provisions of this _Section 5.3_, and (y) the Company will
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with providing or making available such
non-public information to such other Person.

 



 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 5.3_, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in
writing, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt, if
any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received by, any information
is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be
initiated or continued with, the Company in respect of any Takeover Proposal,
and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person
making such proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact and the terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers or the nature of any inquiries or
contacts (and shall include with such notice copies of any written materials
received from or on behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably
informed of all material developments affecting the status and terms of any
such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests (and the Company shall promptly
provide Parent with copies of any additional written materials received by the
Company or that the Company has delivered to any third party making a Takeover
Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of
the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the Company receives a written
Takeover Proposal that the Company Board believes is _bona fide_ , and (ii)
the Company Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, concludes in good faith that such Takeover Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal, then, subject to compliance with _Section 7.3_, the
Company Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval (but in no event after obtaining the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Stockholder Approval), if it determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action could
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (x) effect an
Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) terminate this Agreement and
concurrent with such termination cause the Company to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company Board may not effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless the Company has provided prior
written notice to Parent specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such
action (including a description of the material terms of such Takeover
Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of (1) the Acquisition Agreement for
such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into and (2) any other
relevant documents that are reasonably relevant to the assessment of such
Superior Proposal), at least five (5) calendar days in advance of its
intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, unless
at the time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than
five (5) calendar days prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, in which
case the Company shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable
(the period inclusive of all such days, the " _Notice Period_ ") (it being
understood and agreed that (i) during the Notice Period the Company shall, and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel to, negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent
desires to negotiate), (ii) the Company shall take into account all changes to
the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in determining whether such
Takeover Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (iii) any
material amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.3(d)_ and new Notice Period, except that
such new Notice Period in connection with any material amendment shall be for
two (2) business days from the time Parent receives such notice (as opposed to
five (5) calendar days). After delivery of such written notice pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall promptly keep Parent
informed of all material developments affecting the material terms of any such
Superior Proposal (and the Company shall provide Parent with copies of any
additional written materials received that relate to such Superior Proposal).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 5.3(a)_ to the contrary, the Company
Board may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening Event if
the Company Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisors, that the exercise of its fiduciary duties
require such Adverse Recommendation Change. An " _Intervening Event_ " means,
with respect to the Company, a material event or circumstance that arises or
occurs after the date of this Agreement and was not, prior to the date of this
Agreement, reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of a Takeover
Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof constitute an
Intervening Event.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

" _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person
or " _group_ " (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than

acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
securities of Subsidiaries) equal to 20% or more of the Companys consolidated
assets or to which 20% or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of
beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13 under the Exchange Act)
of 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company, (C) tender
offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Person or "
_group_ " (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially
owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or (D)
merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company which is

at least 20% of the Companys consolidated assets or equity interests; in each
case, other than the Transactions.

 



 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written offer, obtained after the

immaterial breach), to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration
consisting of cash and/or securities, more than 50% of the equity securities
of the Company or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis, made by a third party, which is on terms and conditions which the
Company Board determines in its good faith (after consultation with outside
counsel and an independent financial advisor) to be more favorable to the
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Transactions,
taking into account at the time of determination any changes to the terms of
this Agreement that as of that time had been proposed by Parent in writing.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under
the Exchange Act if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to so disclose such position
could constitute a violation of applicable Law.

 



 

(h) Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing information) or knowingly induce or take any
other action designed to lead to any inquiries or proposals that constitute,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, the submission of a Parent
Alternative Transaction or (ii) enter into any confidentiality agreement,
merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in principle, share purchase
agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or

 



      
 

 



 

other similar agreement with respect to any transaction that would in any
material respect impede or delay the ability of the parties to satisfy any of
the conditions to the Transactions set forth in this Agreement. Nothing in
this _Section 5.3(h)_ or _Section 5.2(b)(vii)_ shall be deemed to prevent
Parent, its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives from taking any action
in connection with any transfer or proposed transfer of equity securities of
Parent by the stockholders party to the Voting Agreement that is not in
violation of the transfer restrictions set forth in the Voting Agreement to
the extent that such transfer does not involve a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation or similar
transaction involving Parent or an exchange offer or tender offer for Parents
equity securities.

 



 

SECTION 5.4. _Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section

Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions and (iv) obtain all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Antitrust Laws_ " means the Sherman Act, as amended, the
Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as
amended, all applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws

with this _Section 5.4_ necessary to cause the expiration or termination of
the applicable

 



      
 

 



 

waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event no
later than the Extended Walk-Away Date); and (ii) the Company and Parent shall
each use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action necessary to
ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or becomes applicable
to any of the Transactions and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar
Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, take all action necessary
to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect
of such Law on the Transactions.

 



 

(c) Each of the parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) its best efforts to (i) cooperate in all respects with
each other in connection with any filing or submission with a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any
investigation or other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating
to the Transactions, including any proceeding initiated by a private party,
(ii) promptly inform the other party of (and supply to the other party) any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,
or any other Governmental Authority and of any material communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding any of the Transactions, (iii) permit the other party to review in
advance and incorporate the other partys reasonable comments in any
communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority with respect to
obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection with
the Transactions and (iv) consult with the other party in advance of any
meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority or, in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, with any other Person, and, to the
extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other Person, give the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
teleconferences. Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising
and implementing the strategy for obtaining any clearances required under any
Antitrust Law in connection with the Transactions and shall take the lead in
all meetings and communications with any Governmental Authority in connection
with obtaining such clearances, _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
consult in advance with the Company and in good faith take the Companys views
into account regarding the overall strategy. The parties shall take reasonable
efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other
privilege pursuant to this Section in a manner so as to preserve the
applicable privilege.

 



 

(d) Parent (including by its Subsidiaries) agrees to take, or cause to be
taken (including by its Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause
to be made (including by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary
to resolve such objections, if any, that a Governmental Authority may assert
under any Antitrust Law with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions, in
each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and
in any event no later than the Extended Walk-Away Date, including,

 



      
 

 



 

without limitation, (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting,
by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of Parent or the Company (or any of their respective Subsidiaries)
or any equity interest in any joint venture held by Parent or the Company (or
any of their respective Subsidiaries), (y) creating, terminating, or divesting
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or
Parent or their respective Subsidiaries and (z) otherwise taking or committing
to take any action that would limit Parents freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses,
assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of Parent or the Company
(including any of their respective Subsidiaries) or any equity interest in any
joint venture held by Parent or the Company (or any of their respective
Subsidiaries), in each case as may be required in order to obtain all
approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting
periods, registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations
required directly or indirectly under any Antitrust Law or to avoid the
commencement of any action to prohibit the Transactions under any Antitrust
Law, or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any action or proceeding seeking to prohibit the Transactions or delay the
Closing beyond the Extended Walk-Away Date. To assist Parent in complying with
its obligations set forth in this _Section 5.4_, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more agreements requested by
Parent to be entered into by any of them prior to the Closing with respect to
any transaction to divest, hold separate or otherwise take any action that
limits the Companys or its Subsidiaries freedom of action, ownership or
control with respect to, or their ability to retain or hold, directly or
indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any equity interest in
any joint venture held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a "
_Divestiture Action_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the consummation of
the transactions provided for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action
(a " _Divestiture Agreement_ ") shall be conditioned upon the Closing or
satisfaction of all of the conditions to Closing in a case where the Closing
will occur immediately following such Divestiture Action (and where Parent has
irrevocably committed to effect the Closing immediately following such
Divestiture Action) and (ii) Parent shall indemnify for and hold the Company
and its Subsidiaries harmless from all costs, expenses and liabilities
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries arising from or relating to such
Divestiture Agreement (other than any of the foregoing arising from the breach
by the Company or any applicable Subsidiary of such Divestiture Agreement).

 



 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.4_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent
shall use best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
Transactions.

 



       
 

 



 

SECTION 5.5. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the
Transactions without the prior consent of the other party (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by Law or
by any applicable listing agreement with a national securities exchange or
Nasdaq as determined in the good faith judgment of the party proposing to make
such release (in which case such party shall not issue or cause the
publication of such press release or other public announcement without prior
consultation with the other party; _provided_ , _however_ that the Company
shall not be required to consult with the other party with respect to a public
announcement in connection with the receipt and existence of a Takeover
Proposal that the board of directors of the Company believes is _bona fide_
and matters related thereto or an Adverse Recommendation Change but nothing in
this proviso shall limit any obligation of the Company under _Section 5.3(d)_
to negotiate with Parent in good faith; _provided_ , that each party and their
respective controlled affiliates may make statements that are not inconsistent
with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by
Parent or the Company in compliance with this _Section 5.5_.

 



 

SECTION 5.6. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the other party and its Representatives reasonable
access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and records,
the right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties (including
the Upstream Assets), commitments, books, Contracts, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives. Each party shall furnish promptly to the other party (i) a
copy of each report, schedule and other document filed or submitted by it
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a copy of
any communication (including " _comment letters_ ") received by such party
from the SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other
information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and
personnel as the other party may reasonably request (including information
necessary to prepare the Joint Proxy/Information Statement). Except for
disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as
of September 22, 2011, between Parent and the Company (as it may be amended
from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), each party and its
Representatives shall hold information received from the Company pursuant to
this _Section 5.6_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) use reasonable efforts (including the assertion of any rights of Company
or its Subsidiaries to information to which such person is entitled pursuant
to an applicable joint operating agreement) to obtain permission for Parent
and its

 



      
 

 



 

representatives to gain access to Upstream Assets operated or held by third
persons and the records and files of such third Persons.

 



 

(b) This _Section 5.6_ shall not require either party to permit any access,
or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such party
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any contract or
Law to which such party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause
any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) which such party or any of
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in such partys
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such partys position in any
pending or, what such party believes in good faith (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) could be, future litigation or (ii) if
such party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the other party or
any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto; _provided_ ,
that, in the cases of clause (i), the parties hereto shall cooperate in
seeking to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by
entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (1)
would not (in the good faith belief of the party being requested to disclose
the information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel)) reasonably be likely to result in the violation of any such contract
or Law or reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with
respect to such information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief
of the party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation
with counsel which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of the other party shall be provided access to such
information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the party being requested to
disclose the information shall (x) notify the other party that such
disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause
such privilege to be undermined, (y) communicate to the other party in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject
matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance
with the first proviso in this _Section 5.6(b)_) and (z) in the case where
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek
consent from the applicable third party to any such contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such contract).

 



 

(c) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section 5.6_
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.

 



 

SECTION 5.7. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the

 



      
 

 



 

subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent could be material to the Company, the New EP Surviving LLC or
Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings
commenced or, to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or
involving or otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which
relate to the Transactions, (iii) the discovery of any fact or circumstance
that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which, would result in the failure to satisfy any of the
conditions to Closing in _Article VI_ (but only to the extent that a person
identified on _Section 8.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ or
_Section 8.11(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule_, as applicable, has
actual knowledge of such fact or circumstance or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of such event) and (iv) any material failure of such party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereunder which would result in the failure to satisfy any of
the conditions to Closing in _Article VI_ (but only to the extent that a
person identified on _Section 8.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ or
_Section 8.11(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule_, as applicable _,_ has
actual knowledge of such material failure).

 



 

SECTION 5.8. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.8_, (i) " _Indemnified Person_ " shall
mean any person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the
Second Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in such capacity, and also with respect to any such Person, in
their capacity as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other entity or
enterprise is affiliated with the Company) serving at the request of or on
behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and together with such
Persons heirs, executor or administrators and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall
mean any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative, investigative or otherwise and whether or not such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation results in a formal civil or
criminal litigation or regulatory action.

 



 

(b) From and after the Second Effective Time, Parent and the New EP Surviving
Corporation jointly and severally shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless
against any cost or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any Proceeding, and provide advancement of expenses to, all
Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and
(ii) honor the provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors,
indemnification of officers, directors and employees and advancement of
expenses contained in the Company Charter Documents and comparable governing
instruments of any Subsidiary of the Company immediately prior to the Second
Effective Time and ensure that the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the New EP Surviving Corporation shall, for a period of six (6) years
following the Second Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with
respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present
and former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company and its
Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in

 



      
 

 



 

the Company Charter Documents. Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified
Person pursuant to this _Section 5.8(b)_ shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified at any time in a manner that would adversely affect the
rights of such Indemnified Person as provided herein.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the New EP Surviving Corporation to, and the New EP
Surviving Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six (6) years from the
Second Effective Time the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance policies covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Second Effective Time with respect to Indemnified Persons (provided that the
New EP Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with reputable
carriers of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that
are no less favorable to the Indemnified Persons); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the New EP Surviving Corporation be required to expend
pursuant to this _Section 5.8(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300%
of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "). In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the New EP Surviving Corporation would be required to
expend more than the Maximum Amount, the New EP Surviving Corporation shall
obtain as much comparable insurance as available for the Maximum Amount. If
the Company in its sole discretion elects, then the Company may, prior to the
Second Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the Second Effective
Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such Indemnified
Persons in their capacity as such; _provided_ that in no event shall the cost
of such policy exceed six (6) times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail
policy" is purchased, Parent and the New EP Surviving Corporation shall have
no further obligations under this _Section 5.8(c)_.

 



 

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section 5.8_ shall be in
addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the New EP
Surviving Corporation Certificate, the New EP Surviving Corporation By-Laws,
the DGCL or the DLLCA. The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ shall survive the
consummation of the Transactions for a period of six (6) years and are
expressly intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their
respective heirs and representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event that any claim or claims for indemnification set forth in _Section 5.8_
are asserted or made within such six (6) year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
disposition of any and all such claims. If Parent and/or New EP Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in
each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent and/or New EP Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of Parent and New EP
Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

 



 

SECTION 5.9. _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder

 



      
 

 



 

litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 



 

SECTION 5.10. _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the Transactions including all legal, accounting, financial
advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of third parties incurred
by a party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees and
expenses, except (a) Parent and the Company shall each bear and pay one-half
of the expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing and mailing
of the Form S-4 and Joint Proxy/Information Statement and (b) as provided in
_Section 7.3_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Parent shall be responsible for and shall pay the amount of any (i)
documentary, sales, use, real property transfer, real property gains,
registration, value-added, transfer, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes
(" _Transfer Taxes_ ") imposed on Parent, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (ii) any Transfer Taxes imposed on the stockholders
of the Company and New EP in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby in respect of assets that are owned directly
or indirectly by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

SECTION 5.11. _Reorganizations Treatment_. The Company, New EP, Merger Sub
One, Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three shall execute and deliver to
Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, counsel to the Company, certificates
substantially in the forms attached hereto at _Exhibits C_ and _D_ at such
time or times as reasonably requested by such law firm in connection with its
delivery of the tax opinion referred to in _Section 6.1(e)_. Prior to the
Second Effective Time, none of the Company, New EP, Merger Sub One, Parent,
Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub Three shall take or cause to be taken any action
which would cause to be untrue any of the representations in such
certificates. Each of the Company, New EP, Merger Sub One, Parent, Merger Sub
Two and Merger Sub Three agree that the value of the Per Share Warrant
Consideration as of the business day immediately prior to the date of this
Agreement would have been $0.96 (the " _Per Share Warrant Consideration Value_
"), including for purposes of applying Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-1T(e)(2)(iv).

 



 

SECTION 5.12. _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Second Effective Time, the Company
and Parent shall take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including derivative
securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is a director
or officer of the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act in accordance with that certain No-Action Letter dated January
12, 1999 issued by the SEC regarding such matters.

 



      
 

 



 

SECTION 5.13. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Second Effective Time, Parent shall honor all Company
Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately before the Second Effective Time,
provided that nothing herein shall limit the right of the Company or Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates from amending or terminating such plans,
arrangements and agreements to the extent permitted by their terms. For a
period of one (1) year following the Second Effective Time (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall cause to be provided,
(i) to each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time (the " _Company Employees_ "),
other than any such Company Employee covered by a Company Collective
Bargaining Agreement, for so long as such Company Employee remains an employee
of the Parent, the New EP Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates during the Continuation Period, base salary and annual bonus
opportunities each of which is no less than that provided to such Company
Employee immediately before the Second Effective Time, (ii) to each Company
Employee, other than any such Company Employee covered by a Collective
Bargaining Agreement or who is not a full-time employee, for so long as such
Company Employee remains an employee of Parent, the Surviving Company or any
of their respective Affiliates during the Continuation Period, compensation
opportunities (other than annual bonus opportunities) and benefits eligibility
which are the same as those provided to similarly situated employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries; provided, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 5.13(a)(ii), during the Continuation Period, Parent
shall provide, or shall cause to be provided to Company Employees and their
eligible dependents who are receiving medical care or treatment under the
Companys Select Plus Program (the " _SPP_ ") and any additional participants
who are receiving medical care or treatment under the SPP, in each case
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time (and in the case of each
Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents,, for so long as such
Company Employee remains an employee of the Parent, the Surviving Company or
any of their respective Affiliates during the Continuation Period), continued
medical care and treatment under the terms of the SPP in effect immediately
prior to the Second Effective Time.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.13(a)_,
during the Continuation Period (or such longer period as may be required under
any Company Benefit Plan as of the date of this Agreement), Parent shall
provide to each Company Employee, other than any such Company Employee covered
by a Collective Bargaining Agreement, whose employment terminates during such
period with such severance pay and benefits that would have been provided to
such Company Employee under the applicable severance pay plan maintained by
the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Second Effective Time. In
addition, to the extent any portion of the Companys assets are sold during
the Continuation Period, Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that the purchaser of such assets provides the foregoing benefits to
the applicable employees who will be employees of the purchaser of such assets
through the end of the Continuation Period.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company, Parent, New
EP, and their respective Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates, as
applicable, will take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of
_Section 5.13(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company, Parent, New
EP, and their respective Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates, as
applicable, will take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions of
_Section 5.13(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

(e) For all purposes (including purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Second Effective Time as required pursuant to this _Section 5.13(e)_ (the "
_New Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years
of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Second Effective Time, to the same extent as such
Company Employee was entitled, before the Second Effective Time, to credit for
such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Second Effective Time, provided that the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the
extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i) each
Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan is comparable to a Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately before the consummation of the Transactions (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee
and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not have been
waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries in which
such employee participated immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, and
Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(f) _Section 280G_.

 



 

(i) Following the date of this Agreement, but in no event later than November
15, 2011, the Company shall provide to Parent the name of each director,
officer, employee and service provider entitled to a gross-up, make whole or
other payment as a result of the imposition of taxes under Section 4999 of the
Code pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

any agreement or arrangement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after request from Parent,
provide Parent with information necessary for Parent (or its advisor) to
calculate the estimated dollar amount (if any) of such gross-up, make whole or
other payment payable to each such individual in connection with the
consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(ii) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall consult with
Parent as to, and shall reasonably consider taking, actions which may be
reasonably requested by Parent, on or prior to December 31, 2011, to reduce
and/or avoid the application of Section 280G of the Code to the payments, if
any, to be made to those individuals disclosed to Parent pursuant to _Section
5.13(f)(i)_ of this Agreement (which actions may include, for example,
accelerating the vesting or payment of equity awards or accelerating the
payment of 2011 bonuses).

 



 

(g) Without limiting the generality of _Section 8.6_, no provision of this
_Section 5.13_ shall be construed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any employee, officer, current or former director or consultant of
the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any beneficiary of such employee, officer,
director or consultant under a Company Benefit Plan, Parent Benefit Plan or
otherwise.

 



 

SECTION 5.14. _Debt Financing_.

 



 

(a) Each of Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three shall use best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary to arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Debt Commitment Letters, including using best efforts (i) to
negotiate and enter into the definitive agreements with respect thereto on the
terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letters (including, as
necessary, the "flex" provisions contained in any related fee letter) by a
date no later than the date that is three months from the date hereof and (ii)
to satisfy (or if determined advisable by Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger
Sub Three, obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to obtaining
the Debt Financing within Parents, Merger Sub Twos and Merger Sub Threes
control and to comply with all of its obligations pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letters and the definitive agreements related thereto. In the event
that all conditions to funding the commitments contained in the Debt
Commitment Letters have been satisfied, each of Parent, Merger Sub Two and
Merger Sub Three shall use its best efforts to cause the Financing Sources to
fund the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and to pay related fees and expenses on the Closing Date
(including by taking enforcement action to cause the Financing Sources to
provide the Debt Financing). Each of Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub
Three shall use its best efforts to enforce all of its rights under the Debt
Commitment Letters. Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three shall give
Seller prompt notice of any material breach by any party to the Debt
Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements related thereto of which
Parent, Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub Three has become aware or any termination

Two and Merger Sub Three shall (1) use their best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, alternative
debt financing for any such portion from alternative debt sources ("
_Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount that will still enable Parent, Merger

agreements (other than any fee letters and engagement letters) pursuant to

Sub Two and Merger Sub Three shall not, without the Companys prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) permit any amendment or modification

amended, modified or waived, are substantially similar to those in such Debt
Commitment Letter or definitive agreement related thereto, prior to giving
effect to such amendment, modification or waiver (other than economic terms,

Three than those in the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreement
relating thereto prior to giving effect to such amendment, modification or
waiver). Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three shall provide the Company
with prompt written notice of the receipt of any notice or other communication
from any financing source with respect to such financing sources failure or
anticipated failure to fund its commitments under any Debt Commitment Letters
or definitive agreement in connection therewith. Parent, Merger Sub Two and
Merger Sub Three shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a reasonably
current basis of the status of its efforts to consummate the Debt Financing.

 



 

(b) The Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide and
shall use its best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to provide
such cooperation in connection with the marketing, arrangement and
consummation of and satisfaction of the conditions to the Debt Financing as
may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided, that such requested
cooperation does not materially and adversely interfere with the ongoing
business operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries (it being understood
that none of the actions listed in clauses (i) through (viii) below shall be
deemed to materially and adversely interfere with the ongoing business
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries)), including but not limited
to: (i) participation in meetings, drafting sessions, presentations, road
shows and due diligence and other sessions with the Financing Sources and
lenders, investors and rating agencies; (ii) furnishing Parent and the
Financing Sources and their representatives as promptly as practicable with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries required, or reasonably requested by Parent, to consummate the
Debt Financing, including (A) all information to be included in a customary
bank information memorandum; (B) all of the information and data related to
the Company and its Subsidiaries necessary (and at the times required) to
satisfy the condition set forth in paragraph 3 of Exhibit D of the Debt
Commitment Letters (or the substantially similar provision thereto in any
Replacement Debt Commitment Letters or Debt Commitment Letters relating to an
Alternative

 



      
 

 



 

Financing) (information and data required to be delivered pursuant to this
clause (ii) being referred to as the " _Required Information_ "); (iii)
assisting Parent, the Financing Sources and their representatives in the
preparation of customary documents and materials, including but not limited to
(A) any offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information

marketing materials and documents for any portion of the Debt Financing and
(B) materials for rating agency presentations; (iv) reasonably cooperating
with the marketing efforts of Parent and the Financing Sources for any portion
of the Debt Financing; (v) executing and delivering (and assisting in the
negotiation of) any pledge or security documents and otherwise facilitating
the granting of a security interest (and perfection thereof) in collateral and
executing and delivering (and assisting in the negotiation of) definitive
financing documents, guarantees, mortgages, underwriting and purchase
agreements, indentures or other documents or customary certificates
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters or as reasonably requested by
Parent; _provided_ that no pledge or security document, definitive financing
document or any other such document or certificate to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is a party shall be effective prior to the Second
Effective Time; (vi) using best efforts to obtain customary authorization
letters with respect to the bank information memoranda and consents of
accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the Debt
Financing, accountants comfort letters and legal opinions as reasonably

occurrence of the Closing, necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt
Financing. The foregoing notwithstanding, (I) none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their Representatives shall be required to pay any
commitment or other fee or incur any other cost or expense that is not
promptly reimbursed by Parent, Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub Three in
connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Second Effective Time and (II)
no obligation of or security interest granted by the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of its or their Representatives undertaken in connection
with the Debt Financing shall be effective until the Second Effective Time. In
addition, the Company agrees that it will use best efforts to supplement the
Required Information to the extent that any such Required Information, to the
knowledge of the Company, contains any material misstatement of fact or omits
to state any material fact necessary to make such information, taken as a
whole, not misleading in any material respect promptly after becoming aware
thereof. All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the
Company or its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub
Three or their respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section 5.14(b)_
shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement;
provided that Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger Sub Three shall be permitted
to disclose such information to rating agencies and prospective lenders and
investors during syndication of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters, subject to customary confidentiality undertakings as
applicable. The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that
such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the

 



       
 

 



 

Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Parent (x) shall, promptly upon request by
the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-

Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall not have any
responsibility for, or incur any liability to any person under, the Debt
Financing (other than obligations pursuant to the definitive agreements
relating to the Debt Financing, effective as of and from the Second Effective
Time, as and to the extent such Persons are party to such documents) and (z)
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing, any action taken by them at the request of
Parent, Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub Three pursuant to _Section 5.14_ and any
information (other than information furnished by or on behalf of the Company
and its Subsidiaries) utilized in connection therewith, in each case, other
than to the extent any of the foregoing arise from the bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of, or breach of this Agreement by, the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective affiliates and
Representatives.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parent, in its sole
discretion, may replace any existing Debt Commitment Letter with a debt
commitment letter (a " _Replacement Debt Commitment Letter_ ") pursuant to
which financial institutions selected by it in its sole discretion commit to
provide debt financing to finance the Transactions (" _Replacement Debt
Financing_ ") and on or following the effectiveness thereof the Parent may, in
its sole discretion terminate the existing Debt Commitment Letter and the
commitments thereunder; provided that, without the Companys consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), the terms of such Replacement Debt
Financing shall be substantially similar to the terms of the Debt Commitment
Letter or definitive agreement relating thereto being replaced (other than
economic terms, which shall be as good as or better for Parent and Merger Sub
than those in the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive agreement relating
thereto being replaced). Promptly following the execution of a Replacement
Debt Commitment Letter by Parent, Parent shall notify the Company to such
effect and shall promptly provide a fully executed copy of such Replacement
Debt Commitment Letter and any related agreements (other than any fee letters
or engagement letters). Such notice shall also satisfy the Parents
notification requirements under _Section 5.14(a)_ relating to termination of
the existing Debt Commitment Letter.

 



 

(d) The Company shall use its best efforts to deliver to Parent on or prior to
the second business day prior to the Second Effective Time, a fully executed
copy of a payoff letter, in customary form, from the Administrative Agent (as
defined in the Existing EP Credit Agreement), which payoff letter shall (i)
indicate the total amount required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal,
interest, prepayment premiums, penalties, breakage costs or similar
obligations related to any Obligations (as defined in the Existing EP Credit
Agreement) as of the anticipated Closing Date (and the daily accrual

 



      
 

 



 

thereafter) (the " _Payoff Amount_ ") (ii) state that upon receipt of the
Payoff Amount, the Existing EP Credit Agreement and related instruments
evidencing the Existing EP Credit Agreement shall be terminated and any stock
certificates and other physical collateral held by the Collateral Agent (as
defined in the Existing EP Credit Agreement) shall be returned, and (iii)
state that all Liens and all guarantees in connection therewith relating to
the assets and properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries securing
such Obligations shall be, upon the payment of the Payoff Amount on the
Closing Date, released and terminated. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use best efforts to deliver all notices and take all other
actions, including assistance with respect to the backstop, replacement or
termination of any letters of credit issued under the Existing EP Credit
Agreement, to facilitate the termination of commitments under the Existing EP
Credit Agreement, the repayment in full of all Obligations then outstanding
thereunder (using funds arranged by Parent, Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub
Three) and the release of all Liens and termination of all guarantees in
connection therewith on the Closing Date (such termination, repayment and
release, the " _Credit Facility Termination_ "); _provided_ that in no event
shall this Section 5.14(d) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
(x) deliver an irrevocable notice of termination or prepayment of any credit
facility, (y) cash collateralize any letters of credit or (z) cause such
Credit Facility Termination unless the Closing shall occur substantially
concurrently and the Company or its Subsidiaries have received funds from
Parent to pay in full the Payoff Amount. To the extent the Company or its
Subsidiaries do not obtain the any amendment or waiver contemplated in
_Section 5.14(e)_ below, either (i) the provisions of this _Section 5.14(d)_
relating to the "Existing EP Credit Agreement" shall apply to the applicable
Waiver Credit Agreement or (ii) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, at the
request of Parent, and at Parents expense, use their best efforts to
refinance the credit facilities set forth in the applicable Waiver Credit
Agreement, effective upon the Second Effective Time on terms that permit the
Transactions and are reasonably acceptable to the Parent (and such refinancing
shall not be subject to the refinancing restriction set forth in _Section
5.2(b)(i)_).

 



 

(e) The Company shall use its best efforts to assist Parent in obtaining, at
Parents expense, as soon as possible after the date of this Agreement and in
any event on or prior to the forty-fifth (45th) business day prior to the
Second Effective Time, a fully executed copy of an amendment or waiver of each
of the Waiver Credit Agreements which amends or waives the "change of control"
provisions set forth therein to permit the Transactions, such amendment or
waiver to be effective at or prior to the Second Effective Time.

 



 

(f) The Company shall, on a weekly basis, give Parent updates on the balances
outstanding under the Existing EP Credit Agreement and EandP BNP Paribas Credit
Agreement.

 



 

(g) The Company shall be permitted, at the Companys expense, to seek and to
obtain consent of the lenders under the indebtedness set forth on _Section
5.14(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ to permit the closing of the First
Merger.

agreement (the " _Parent Shareholders Agreement_ ") to effect such increase)
to elect two (2) individuals designated by the Company to Parents Board of
Directors (one of which shall be appointed to Parents Audit Committee and one
of which shall be appointed to Parents Governance Committee), effective as
of, and subject to the occurrence of, the Second Effective Time and (ii) cause
its by-laws to be amended to amend the definition of "Supermajority Board
Vote" to change the reference to eight (8) directors in the first line thereof
to ten (10) directors.

 



 

SECTION 5.16. _Sale of Upstream Assets_. The Company shall, and shall cause
its controlled Subsidiaries to, reasonably assist Parent in the preparation
for the sale of certain or all of the Companys Upstream Assets, it being
understood that it is the desire and intent of the parties to, if reasonably
practicable, consummate the sale of such Upstream Assets immediately prior to
the Closing. As may be reasonably requested by Parent, the Company shall, and
shall cause its controlled Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more
agreement(s) with third parties to facilitate the sale of any Upstream Assets
identified by Parent (such agreements to contain customary covenants and other
terms and conditions for transactions of such size and nature); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) the consummation of the transactions provided for in any
such agreement for a sale of Upstream Assets (an " _Upstream Sale Agreement_
") shall be conditioned upon the Closing or satisfaction of all of the
conditions to Closing in a case where the Closing will occur immediately
following the sale of the Upstream Assets and on Parent being and irrevocably
confirming that it is ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing, and
it and its Financing Source have irrevocably committed to, effect the Closing

indemnify for and hold the Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from any and
all costs, expenses (including interest, court and other legal proceeding
costs, fees of attorneys, accountants and other experts or other expenses of
litigation or other proceedings), losses, damages, fines, penalties, Taxes,
and liabilities incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries arising from or
relating to such Upstream Sale Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, but
without prejudice to _Section 6.2(b)_, in no event shall the entering into of
an agreement or the consummation of any sale of any Upstream Assets, in and of
itself, by Parent, Merger Sub Two, Merger Sub Three, the Company, New EP or
Merger Sub One be a condition to any of Parents, Merger Sub Twos or Merger
Sub Threes obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 5.17. _Employee Information and Consultation_. The Company, its
Subsidiaries and each of its and their Affiliates, as applicable, shall inform

connection with this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

and the transactions, and shall take all other necessary actions in connection
with employees covered thereby as may be required pursuant to applicable Laws.

 



 

SECTION 5.18. _Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the shares of Parent Class P Stock and the Parent Class P Warrants to be
issued pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement (including the Parent
Class P Stock issuable upon exercise of the Parent Class P Warrants) to be
approved for listing (subject, if applicable, to notice of issuance) for
trading on the NYSE prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that if the NYSE will
not approve the listing of the Parent Class P Warrants on the NYSE, then
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Parent Class P
Warrants to be approved for listing (subject, if applicable, to notice of
issuance) on either (x) NASDAQ or (y) such other exchange(s), electronic
trading networks or other suitable trading platforms as are reasonably agreed
to by Parent and the Company.

except, in the case of this clause (iv), where the failure of such

have received a certificate signed on behalf of the Company by an executive
officer of the Company to such effect.

on either (x) the NYSE, (y) NASDAQ or (z) such other exchange(s), electronic
trading networks or other suitable trading platforms as are reasonably agreed
to by Parent and the Company.

 



 

SECTION 6.4. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent,
New EP, Merger Sub One, Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub Three may rely on the
failure of any condition set forth in Section _6.1_ , _6.2_ or _6.3_ , as the

Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 7.3. _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section

termination) (" _Parent Expenses_ "), payable by wire transfer of same day
funds.

 



 

(b) In the event that (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made known to
the Company or shall have been made directly to its stockholders generally or
any Person shall have publicly announced an intention to make a Takeover
Proposal which proposal shall not have been withdrawn prior to the date of the
Company Stockholder Meeting (or if the Company Stockholder Meeting shall not
have occurred, prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(i)_) and thereafter, (B) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, and (C) the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with respect to, or consummates a Takeover Proposal
within twelve (12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated, then the

_Termination Fee_ ") less any amount of Parent Expenses previously paid, by
wire transfer of same day funds, upon the earlier of the public announcement
of the Companys entry into any such agreement or the consummation of any such
transaction. For purposes of this _Section 7.3(b)_, the term "Takeover
Proposal" shall have meaning assigned to such term in _Section 5.3(f)_,
except that the references to "20% or more" shall be deemed to be references
to "more than 50%".

 



 

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent,
within two (2) business days after the date of termination, the Termination
Fee, payable by wire transfer of same day funds.

 



 

(d) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(d)(iii)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent, immediately

transfer of same day funds.

 



 

(e) In the event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or
the Parent Expenses required pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ when due, such
fee and/or expenses, as the case may be, shall accrue interest for the period
commencing on the date such fee and/or expenses, as the case may be, became
past due, at a rate equal to the legal rate of interest provided for in
Section 2301 of Title 6 of the Delaware Code. In addition, if the Company
shall fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or the Parent Expenses, as the case
may be, when due, the Company shall also pay to Parent all of Parents costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect
such fee and/or expenses, as the case may be. The Company acknowledges that
the provisions of this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions
and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this
Agreement. The parties agree that in the event the Company pays the
Termination Fee to Parent, the Company shall have no further liability to
Parent, Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub Three and that in no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion;
_provided_ , that, nothing contained herein shall relieve the Company from
liability for fraud or a Willful Breach of any covenant or other agreement
contained in this Agreement. The parties further agree that in the event the
Company pays the Parent Expenses to Parent, the Company shall have no further
liability to Parent, Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub Three except solely in those
circumstances set forth in _Section 7.3_ when the Termination Fee is payable
and then any such further liability shall be limited to an amount equal to the
Termination Fee less the Parent Expenses previously paid; _provided_ , that,
nothing contained herein shall relieve the Company from liability for fraud or
a Willful Breach of any covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement.

Sub Three in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement

only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

SECTION 8.6. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Voting

Person other than the parties hereto any rights (including third party
beneficiary rights or otherwise) or remedies hereunder, except for in the case

agrees and acknowledges that in the event of a partys Willful Breach or
failure to consummate the Transactions when required pursuant to this
Agreement or fraud (such party, the " _Alleged Breaching Party_ "), the other
party shall have the right to pursue all legally available damages against
such Alleged Breaching Party, and the Alleged Breaching Party shall have the
right to assert all legally available defenses.

 



 

SECTION 8.7. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in and to be
performed entirely within that State.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware
Court of Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court lacks subject matter

such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the federal court of the United
States of America sitting in Delaware, and any appellate court from any
thereof, (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of

thereof for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this
Agreement, (vi) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any claim that
it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of the Delaware Court
of Chancery, or, if (and only if) such court lacks subject matter
jurisdiction, the federal court of the United States of America sitting in
Delaware or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through

Financing Sources and their Affiliates, stockholders and Representatives (i)
shall be subject to no liability or claims by the Company Related Parties
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or in connection with the Debt Financing, or
the performance of services by the Financing Sources or their Affiliates or
Representatives with respect to the foregoing, (ii) shall, without limiting
the provisions of clause (i), be beneficiaries of all limitations on remedies
and damages in this Agreement that apply to Parent and (iii) are express third
party beneficiaries of this Section (which may not be changed as to any
Financing Source without its prior written consent). Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement
irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices

party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to the matters addressed in such
Sections.

 



 

(d) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR

ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND

 



      
 

 



 

ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT.

 



 

SECTION 8.8. _Specific Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement (including the parties obligations under
_Sections 5.4_ , _5.14_ and every other provision of this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions and Parents and Merger Sub Twos obligation to
pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and enforce their rights under the Debt
Commitment Letters), in each case, in accordance with this _Section 8.8_ in
the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity; _provided_ , however, that the Company shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent, Merger Sub Two or
Merger Sub Three to consummate the Transactions, including to effect the
Closing in accordance with _Section 1.2_, on the terms and subject to the
conditions in this Agreement, if, but only if: (A) all conditions in _Sections
6.1_ and _6.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing) have been satisfied or are then capable of being
satisfied on or prior to the Closing, (B) Parent, Merger Sub Two and Merger
Sub Three fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to
have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_, (C) the Debt Financing has been
funded or will be funded at the Closing and (D) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is
funded, then the Closing will occur. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, it is hereby acknowledged and agreed that the Company shall be
entitled to seek specific performance to cause Parent, Merger Sub Two and
Merger Sub Three to enforce, including against anticipatory breach, the
obligations of the lenders to fund the Debt Financing under the Debt
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements relating thereto, but only in the
event that each of the following has been satisfied: (i) all of the conditions
set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ have been satisfied or are then capable
of being satisfied prior to the Closing (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), and Parent, Merger Sub Two
and Merger Sub Three fail to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_ and (ii) all of the
conditions to the consummation of the financing provided by the Debt
Commitment Letters (or, if alternative financing is being used in accordance
with _Section 5.14_, pursuant to the commitments with respect thereto) have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing). Nothing in the immediately preceding sentence shall
be construed to relieve Parent, Merger Sub Two or Merger Sub Three of any of
their respective obligations, or to otherwise limit or modify any of Parents,
Merger Sub Twos or Merger Sub Threes obligations, under _Section 5.14_, it
being acknowledged and agreed that in the event that any of the Financing
Source(s) initiate litigation against Parent, Merger Sub Two or

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub Three with respect to the Debt Financing, or advise Parent, Merger
Sub Two or Merger Sub Three that they intend not to proceed with the Debt
Financing in violation of the terms of the Debt Commitment Letters, the
Company shall be entitled to specific performance to require Parent, Merger
Sub Two and Merger Sub Three to take enforcement action, including seeking
specific performance, to cause such Financing Sources to provide such Debt
Financing, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in clauses
(i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence. Each of the parties agrees
that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) either
party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is
not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each party further
agrees that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this _Section 8.8_, and each party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument.

 



 

SECTION 8.9. _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered

WARRANT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of [*], 201[*], between
Kinder Morgan, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and [*], a
[*], as warrant agent (the " _Warrant Agent_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company, Sherpa Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Sherpa
Acquisition, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Sirius Merger
Corporation, a Delaware corporation, Sirius Holdings Merger Corporation, a
Delaware corporation, and El Paso Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _El
Paso_ "), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October
16, 2011 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), providing for, among other things, the
acquisition of El Paso by the Company through the consummation of the
Transactions (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the result of which will
include El Paso being a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company;

 



 

WHEREAS, in partial consideration of the merger and other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue warrants
(each, a " _Warrant_ " and collectively, the " _Warrants_ ") to purchase
shares of Class P common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
" _Common Stock_ "), to the stockholders of El Paso;

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company desires that the Warrant Agent act on behalf of the
Company, and the Warrant Agent is willing to so act, in connection with the
issuance, transfer, exchange, replacement, cancellation and exercise of the
Warrants; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the Company desires to provide for the form and provisions of the
Warrants, the terms upon which the Warrants shall be issued and exercised and
the respective rights and obligations of the Company, the Warrant Agent and
the registered owners of the Warrants (each, a " _Holder_ " and collectively,
the " _Holders_ ").

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and for other good and
valuable consideration given to each party hereto, the receipt of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Warrant Agent agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
ISSUANCE AND EXERCISE OF WARRANTS**

 



 

SECTION 1.1 _Form of Warrant_. Each Warrant shall be evidenced by a
certificate substantially in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit A** (each,
a " _Warrant Certificate_ " and collectively, " _Warrant Certificates_ ").
Each Warrant Certificate shall have such insertions as are required or
permitted by this Agreement and may have such letters, numbers or other marks
of identification and such legends and endorsements, stamped, printed,
lithographed or engraved thereon, as may be required to comply with this
Agreement, any applicable law or any rule of any securities exchange on which
the Warrants may be listed. Each Warrant Certificate shall be executed on
behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or one of its Executive Vice
Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon and attested by its
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary. The signature of any such officers on the
Warrant Certificates may be manual or facsimile. Warrant Certificates bearing
the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were at any time the
proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that
such individuals or any

 

  

    
 

 



 

one of them shall have ceased to hold such offices prior to the delivery of
such Warrants or did not hold such offices on the date of this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 1.2 _Countersignature of Warrants_. Each Warrant Certificate shall be
countersigned by the Warrant Agent (or any successor to the Warrant Agent then
acting as warrant agent under this Agreement) by manual or facsimile signature
and shall not be valid for any purpose unless and until so countersigned.
Warrant Certificates may be countersigned and delivered, notwithstanding the
fact that the persons or any one of them who countersigned the Warrants shall
have ceased to be proper signatories prior to the delivery of such Warrants or
were not proper signatories on the date of this Agreement. Each Warrant
Certificate shall be dated as of the date of its countersignature by the
Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agents countersignature shall be conclusive
evidence that the Warrant Certificate so countersigned has been duly
authenticated and issued under this Agreement.

 



 

SECTION 1.3 _Exercise Number; Exercise Price_. Each Warrant initially entitles
its Holder to purchase from the Company one (1) (the " _Exercise Number_ ")
share of Common Stock (such share or shares of Common Stock issued or issuable
upon exercise of any Warrant or Warrants, each, a " _Warrant Share_ " and
collectively, the " _Warrant Shares_ ") for a purchase price per share of
Common Stock of $40.00 (the " _Exercise Price_ "). The Exercise Number and the
Exercise Price are subject to adjustment as provided in Article II, and all
references to "Exercise Number" and "Exercise Price" in this Agreement shall
be deemed to include any such adjustment or series of adjustments.

 



 

SECTION 1.4 _Term of Warrants_. All or a portion of the Warrants are
exercisable by the Holder at any time and from time to time on or after the
date of this Agreement until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the five
(5)-year anniversary of the date of this Agreement (the " _Expiration Date_
").

 



 

SECTION 1.5 _Exercise of Warrants_. A Warrant may be exercised by surrender of
the Warrant Certificate or Certificates evidencing such Warrant to be
exercised and by delivery to the Warrant Agent (or to such other office or
agency of the Company in the United States as the Company may designate by
notice in writing to the Holders pursuant to Section 4.1) a notice of exercise
in the form attached hereto as **Exhibit B**, duly completed and signed,
which signature shall be guaranteed by a member of a recognized guarantee
medallion program, together with payment of the Exercise Price for the Warrant
Shares thereby purchased in accordance with Section 1.6. As promptly as
practicable after receiving a notice of exercise to purchase Warrant Shares,
the Warrant Agent shall notify the Company.

 



 

SECTION 1.6 _Payment of Exercise Price_. Payment of the aggregate Exercise
Price for all Warrant Shares purchased may be made, at the option of the
Holder, either (a) in cash or by certified or official bank check payable to
the Warrant Agent or (b) by delivering a written direction to the Warrant
Agent that the Holder desires to exercise the Warrants pursuant to a "cashless
exercise," in which case the Holder will receive a number of Warrant Shares
that is equal to the aggregate number of Warrant Shares for which the Warrants
are being exercised less the number of Warrant Shares that have an aggregate
Market Price on the trading day on which such Warrants are exercised that is
equal to the aggregate Exercise Price for such Warrant Shares. For the
avoidance of doubt, if Warrants are exercised such that the aggregate Exercise

 



 

2  

    
 

 



 

Price would exceed the aggregate value (as measured by the Market Price) of
the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise, no amount shall be due and payable
by the Holder to the Company, and such exercise shall be null and void and no
Warrant Shares shall thereupon be issued and the Warrants shall continue in
effect.

 



 

SECTION 1.7 _Registry of Warrants_. The Company or an agent duly appointed by
the Company (which initially shall be the Warrant Agent) shall maintain a
registry showing the names and addresses of the respective Holders and the
date and number of Warrants evidenced on the face of each of the Warrant
Certificates. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or in the Warrant
Certificate, the Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat any Person
whose name a Warrant Certificate is registered in the registry as the absolute
owner of such Warrant Certificate.

 



 

SECTION 1.8 _Exchange of Warrant Cert ificates_. Each Warrant Certificate may
be exchanged for another Warrant Certificate or Certificates of like tenor and
representing the same aggregate number of Warrants. Any Holder desiring to
exchange a Warrant Certificate or Certificates shall deliver a written request
to the Warrant Agent and shall properly endorse and surrender the Warrant
Certificate or Certificates to be so exchanged. Thereupon, the Warrant Agent
shall countersign and deliver to the Holder a new Warrant Certificate or
Certificates, as so requested, in such name or names as such Holder shall
designate.

 



 

SECTION 1.9 _Cancellation of Warrant Certificates_. If and when any Warrant
Certificate has been exercised in full, the Warrant Agent shall promptly
cancel and destroy such Warrant Certificate following its receipt from the
Holder. Upon exercise of a Warrant Certificate in part and not in full, the
Warrant Agent shall issue and deliver or shall cause to be issued and
delivered to the Holder a new Warrant Certificate or Certificates evidencing
the Holders remaining Warrants. The Warrant Agent is hereby irrevocably
authorized to countersign and deliver such required new Warrant Certificate or
Certificates, and the Company, whenever requested by the Warrant Agent, shall
supply the Warrant Agent with Warrant Certificates duly executed on behalf of
the Company for such purpose. The Warrant Agent and no one else may cancel and
destroy Warrant Certificates surrendered for transfer, exchange, replacement,
cancellation or exercise. The Warrant Agent must deliver a certificate of such
destruction and cancellation (or, if requested by the Company, the cancelled
Warrant Certificates) to the Company. The Company may not issue new Warrant
Certificates to replace cancelled Warrant Certificates that have been
exercised or purchased by it.

 



 

SECTION 1.10 _No Fractional Shares or Scrip_. No fractional Warrant Shares or
scrip representing fractional Warrant Shares shall be issued upon any exercise
of Warrants. In lieu of any fractional Warrant Shares that would otherwise be
issued to a Holder upon exercise of any Warrants, such Holder shall receive a
cash payment equal to the Market Price of the Common Stock on the trading day
on which such Warrants are exercised representing such fractional Warrant
Share.

 



 

SECTION 1.11 _Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Mutil ated Warrants_. Upon receipt by
the Company of proof reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft,
destruction or mutilation of any Warrant Certificate and, if requested, an
indemnity or bond, the Company shall deliver or shall cause to be delivered,
in lieu of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant

 



 

3  

    
 

 



 

Certificate, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and representing the same
aggregate number of Warrants as provided for in such lost, stolen, destroyed
or mutilated Warrant Certificate.

 



 

SECTION 1.12 _Trans ferability and Assignment_. At the option of the Holder
thereof, the Warrants and all rights under the Warrant Certificate may be
sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any other manner
transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part, by the registered Holder or
by duly authorized attorney, and one or more new Warrant Certificates shall be
made and delivered and registered in the name of one or more transferees, upon
surrender in accordance with Section 1.5 and upon compliance with all
applicable laws.

 



 

SECTION 1.13 _Issuance of Warrant Certifi cates_. When any Holder, transferee
of a Holder or other designee of a Holder is entitled to receive a new or
replacement Warrant Certificate, whether pursuant to Section 1.8, 1.9, 1.11 or
1.12, the Company shall issue or shall cause to be issued such new or
replacement Warrant Certificate within a reasonable time, not to exceed three
(3) business days. The Company shall supply the Warrant Agent with Warrant
Certificates duly executed on behalf of the Company for the purpose of issuing
any new or replacement Warrant Certificates, and the Warrant Agent shall
countersign such Warrant Certificates.

 



 

SECTION 1.14 _Issuance of Warrant Shares_. Upon the exercise of any Warrants,
the Company shall deliver or shall cause to be delivered the number of full
Warrant Shares to which such Holder shall be entitled, together with any cash
to which such Holder shall be entitled in respect of fractional Warrant Shares
pursuant to Section 1.10, within a reasonable time, not to exceed three (3)
business days. All Warrant Shares shall be issued in such name or names as the
exercising Holder may designate and delivered to the exercising Holder or its
nominee or nominees.

 



 

SECTION 1.15 _Charges, Taxes and Expenses_. The Company shall pay all
documentary stamp taxes, if any, attributable to the initial issuance of
Warrant Shares upon the exercise of Warrants; provided, however, the Company
shall not be required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect
of any transfer involved in the issue or delivery of any Warrants or
certificates (if any) for Warrant Shares in a name other than that of the
registered holder of such Warrants.

 



 

SECTION 1.16 _Issued Warrant Shares_. The Company hereby represents and
warrants that all Warrant Shares issued in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement will be duly and validly authorized and issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges (other than liens or
charges created by a Holder, income and franchise taxes incurred in connection
with the exercise of the Warrant or taxes in respect of any transfer occurring
contemporaneously therewith). The Company agrees that the Warrant Shares so
issued will be deemed to have been issued to a Holder as of the close of
business on the date on which the Warrants were duly exercised,
notwithstanding that the stock transfer books of the Company may then be
closed or certificates (if any) representing such Warrant Shares may not be
actually delivered on such date.

 



 

SECTION 1.17 _Reservation of Sufficient Warrant Shares_. There have been
reserved, and the Company shall at all times through the Expiration Date keep
reserved, out of its

 



 

4  

    
 

 



 

authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of the issuance
of Warrant Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, a number of
shares of Common Stock sufficient to provide for the exercise of the rights of
purchase represented by the outstanding Warrants. The transfer agent for the
Common Stock and every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the
Companys capital stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the rights of
purchase aforesaid shall be irrevocably authorized and directed at all times
to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such
purpose. The Company shall supply such transfer agents with duly executed
stock certificates for such purposes and shall provide or otherwise make
available any cash that may be payable upon exercise of Warrants in respect of
fractional Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 1.10. The Company shall furnish
such transfer agent with a copy of all notices of adjustments and certificates
related thereto, transmitted to each Holder pursuant to Section 4.1.

 



 

SECTION 1.18 _Registration and Listing_. The Company shall register or shall
cause to be registered any and all shares of its Common Stock (including the
Warrant Shares) and all the Warrants under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "), and the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such registration of such shares
of its Common Stock (including the Warrant Shares) and all the Warrants. The
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to (a) procure, or cause to be
procured, at its sole expense, the listing of the Warrant Shares and the
Warrants, subject to issuance or notice of issuance, on the New York Stock
Exchange or, if prior to the closing of the Merger the New York Stock Exchange
will not approve the listing of the Warrants on the New York Stock Exchange,
then on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange or, if prior to the closing of the Merger
the NASDAQ Stock Exchange will not approve the listing of the Warrants on the
NASDAQ Stock Exchange, another stock exchange reasonably agreed by the Company
and El Paso, and (b) maintain such listings at all times until the Expiration
Date. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Warrant
Shares and the Warrants may be issued without violation of any applicable law
or regulation or of any requirement of any securities exchange on which such
shares of its Common Stock (including the Warrant Shares) and the Warrants are
listed or traded.

 



 

SECTION 1.19 _No Impairment_. The Company will not, and the Company will cause
its subsidiaries not to, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance
of any of the terms to be observed or performed by the Company under this
Agreement. The Company shall at all times in good faith assist in the carrying
out of all provisions of this Agreement and in the taking of all such action
as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the
Holders.

 



 

SECTION 1.20 _CUSIP Numbers_. The Company, in issuing the Warrants, may use
"CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use) and, if so, the Warrant Agent shall
use "CUSIP" numbers in notices as a convenience to Holders; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such notice may state that no representation is made as
to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Warrant
Certificates or as contained in any notice and that reliance may be placed
only on the other identification numbers printed on the Warrant Certificates.

 



 

5  

    
 

 



 

SECTION 1.21 _Purchase of Warrants by the Company; Cancellation_. The Company
shall have the right, except as limited by law, other agreements or as
provided herein, to purchase or otherwise acquire Warrants at such times, in
such manner and for such consideration as it and the applicable Holder may
deem appropriate. In the event the Company shall purchase or otherwise acquire
Warrants, the same shall thereupon be delivered to the Warrant Agent and
retired and, for the avoidance of doubt, if the approval of Holders is
required to take any action, the Companys (or any of its subsidiaries or
affiliates) ownership in any Warrants shall not be considered in calculating
whether the requisite number of Warrants have approved such action.

 



 

SECTION 1.22 _No Rights as Stockholders_. A Warrant shall not, prior to its
exercise, confer upon its Holder or such Holders transferee, in such Holders
or such transferees capacity as a Warrant Holder, the right to vote or
receive dividends, or consent or receive notice as stockholders in respect of
any meeting of stockholders for the election of directors of the Company or
any other matter, or any rights whatsoever as stockholders of the Company.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
ANTIDILUTION PROVISIONS**

 



 

SECTION 2.1 _Adjustments and Other Rights_. The Exercise Price and the
Exercise Number shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided
by this Article II; _provided_ , _however_ , that if more than one section of
this Article II is applicable to a single event, the section shall be applied
that produces the largest adjustment, and no single event shall cause an
adjustment under more than one section of this Article II so as to result in
duplication.

 



 

SECTION 2.2 _Stock Splits, Subdivisions, Reclassifications or Combinations_.
If the Company shall (a) declare and pay a dividend or make a distribution on
its Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, (b) subdivide or reclassify the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, or (c)
combine or reclassify the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares, the Exercise Number at the time of the record date for such
dividend or distribution or the effective date of such subdivision,
combination or reclassification shall be adjusted by multiplying the Exercise
Number effective immediately prior to such event by a fraction (x) the
numerator of which shall be the total number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock immediately after such event and (y) the denominator of which shall be
the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately prior to
such event. In such event, the Exercise Price per share of Common Stock in
effect immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution
or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification
shall be adjusted by multiplying such Exercise Price by a fraction (i) the
numerator of which shall be the Exercise Number immediately prior to such
adjustment and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the new Exercise Number
determined pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

 



 

SECTION 2.3 _Other Distributions_. If the Company shall fix a record date for
the making of a distribution to all holders of shares of its Common Stock of
securities, evidences of indebtedness, assets, cash, rights or warrants
(excluding Ordinary Cash Dividends, dividends of its Common Stock and other
dividends or distributions referred to in Section 2.2), in each such

 



 

6  

    
 

 



 

case, the Exercise Price in effect prior to such record date shall be reduced
immediately upon occurrence of the record date to the price determined by
multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the reduction by
the quotient of (x) the Market Price of the Common Stock on the last trading
day preceding the first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on
the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed
or admitted to trading without the right to receive such distribution, minus
the amount of cash and/or the Fair Market Value of the securities, evidences
of indebtedness, assets, rights or warrants to be so distributed in respect of
one share of Common Stock (such subtracted amount and/or Fair Market Value,
the " _Per Share Fair Market Value_ ") divided by (y) such Market Price on
such date specified in clause (x); such adjustment shall be made successively
whenever such a record date is fixed. In such event, the Exercise Number shall
be increased to the number obtained by multiplying the Exercise Number
immediately prior to such adjustment by the quotient of (x) the Exercise Price
in effect immediately prior to the distribution giving rise to this adjustment
divided by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence. In the case of adjustment for a cash dividend
that is, or is coincident with, a regular quarterly cash dividend, the Per
Share Fair Market Value would be reduced by the per share amount of the
portion of the cash dividend that would constitute an Ordinary Cash Dividend.

 



 

SECTION 2.4 _Certain Repurchases of Common Stock. _If the Company effects a
Pro Rata Repurchase of Common Stock, then the Exercise Price shall be reduced
to the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Date of such Pro Rata Repurchase by a
fraction of which (a) the numerator shall be (i) the product of (x) the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such Pro Rata
Repurchase and (y) the Market Price of a share of Common Stock on the trading
day immediately preceding the first public announcement by the Company or any
of its Affiliates of the intent to effect such Pro Rata Repurchase, minus (ii)
the aggregate purchase price of the Pro Rata Repurchase, and of which (b) the
denominator shall be the product of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to such Pro Rata Repurchase minus the number of
shares of Common Stock so repurchased and (ii) the Market Price per share of
Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the first public
announcement by the Company or any of its Affiliates of the intent to effect
such Pro Rata Repurchase. In such event, the Exercise Number shall be
increased to the number obtained by multiplying the Exercise Number
immediately prior to such adjustment by the quotient of (x) the Exercise Price
in effect immediately prior to the Pro Rata Repurchase giving rise to this
adjustment divided by (y) the new Exercise Price determined in accordance with
the immediately preceding sentence. For the avoidance of doubt, no increase to
the Exercise Price or decrease in the Exercise Number shall be made pursuant
to this Section 2.4.

 



 

SECTION 2.5 _Business Combinations or Reclassi fications of Common Stock_. In
case of any Business Combination or reclassification of Common Stock (other
than a reclassification of Common Stock referred to in Section 2.2), a
Holders right to receive shares upon exercise of a Warrant shall be converted
into the right to exercise such Warrant to acquire the number of shares of
stock or other securities or property (including cash) that the Common Stock
issuable (at the time of such Business Combination or reclassification) upon
exercise of such Warrant immediately prior to such Business Combination or
reclassification would have been entitled to receive upon consummation of such
Business Combination or reclassification; and in any such case, if necessary,
the provisions set forth herein with respect to the rights and

 



 

7  

     
 

 



 

interests thereafter of the Holder shall be appropriately adjusted so as to be
applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, to such Holders right to exercise
a Warrant in exchange for any shares of stock or other securities or property
pursuant to this section. In determining the kind and amount of stock,
securities or the property receivable upon exercise of a Warrant following the
consummation of such Business Combination, if the holders of Common Stock have
the right to elect the kind or amount of consideration receivable upon
consummation of such Business Combination, then the consideration that a
Holder shall be entitled to receive upon exercise shall be deemed to be the
types and amounts of consideration received by the majority of all holders of
the shares of Common Stock that affirmatively make an election (or of all such
holders if none make an election). For purposes of determining any amount to
be withheld in the case of a "cashless exercise" pursuant to Section 1.6 from
stock, securities or the property that would otherwise be delivered to a
Holder upon exercise of Warrants following any Business Combination, the
amount of such stock, securities or property to be withheld shall have a
Market Price equal to the aggregate Exercise Price as to which such Warrants
are so exercised, based on the fair market value of such stock, securities or
property on the trading day on which such Warrants are exercised and the
Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Warrant Agent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the case of any property that is not a security, the Market Price of
such property shall be deemed to be its fair market value as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors in reliance on an opinion of a nationally
recognized independent investment banking firm retained by the Company for
this purpose; _provided_ , _further_ , that if making such determination
requires the conversion of any currency other than U.S. dollars into U.S.
dollars, such conversion shall be done in accordance with customary procedures
based on the rate for conversion of such currency into U.S. dollars displayed
on the relevant page by Bloomberg L.P. (or any successor or replacement
service) on or by 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on such exercise date.

 



 

SECTION 2.6 _Rounding of Calcul ations; Minimum Adjustments_. All calculations
under this Article II shall be made to the nearest one-tenth (1/10th) of a
cent or to the nearest one-hundredth (1/100th) of a share, as the case may be.
Any provision of this Article II to the contrary notwithstanding, no
adjustment in the Exercise Price or the Exercise Number shall be made if the
amount of such adjustment would be less than $0.01 or one-tenth (1/10th) of a
share of Common Stock, but any such amount shall be carried forward and an
adjustment with respect thereto shall be made at the time of and together with
any subsequent adjustment which, together with such amount and any other
amount or amounts so carried forward, shall aggregate $0.01 or 1/10th of a
share of Common Stock, or more, or on exercise of a Warrant if it shall
earlier occur.

 



 

SECTION 2.7 _Timing of Issuance of Additional Common Stock Upon Certain
Adjustments_. In any case in which the provisions of this Article II shall
require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record
date for an event, the Company may defer until the occurrence of such event
(a) issuing to a Holder of Warrants exercised after such record date and
before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of Common Stock
issuable upon such exercise by reason of the adjustment required by such event
over and above the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise before
giving effect to such adjustment and (b) paying to such Holder any amount of
cash in lieu of a fractional share of Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company upon request shall deliver to such Holder a due bill or other
appropriate instrument evidencing such Holders right to receive such
additional shares,

 



 

8  

    
 

 



 

and such cash, upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment,
subject to any retroactive readjustment in accordance with Section 2.8(b).

 



 

SECTION 2.8 _Other Events; Provisions of General Applicability_.

 



 

(a) Neither the Exercise Price nor the Exercise Number shall be adjusted in
the event of (i) a change in the par value of the Common Stock, (ii) a change
in the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company or (iii) any conversion of
shares of any other class of common stock of the Company outstanding as of the
date of this Agreement into shares of Common Stock in accordance with the
conversion mechanisms set forth in the Companys certificate of incorporation
as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that any dividend or distribution described in this Article
II is not so made, the Exercise Price and the Exercise Number then in effect
shall be readjusted, effective as of the date when the Board of Directors
determines not to distribute such shares, evidences of indebtedness, assets,
rights, cash or warrants, as the case may be, to the Exercise Price and the
Exercise Number that would then be in effect if such record date had not been
fixed.

 



 

SECTION 2.9 _Statement Regarding Adjustments_. Whenever the Exercise Price or
the Exercise Number shall be adjusted as provided in this Article II, the
Company shall forthwith file at the principal office of the Company a
statement showing in reasonable detail the facts requiring such adjustment and
the Exercise Price that shall be in effect and the Exercise Number after such
adjustment. The Company shall deliver to the Warrant Agent a copy of such
statement and shall cause a copy of such statement to be sent or communicated
to the Holders pursuant to Section 4.1.

 



 

SECTION 2.10 _Notice of Adjustment Event_. In the event that the Company shall
propose to take any action of the type described in this Article II (but only
if the action of the type described in this Article II would result in an
adjustment in the Exercise Price or the Exercise Number or a change in the
type of securities or property to be delivered upon exercise of a Warrant),
the Company shall deliver to the Warrant Agent a notice and shall cause such
notice to be sent or communicated to the Holders in the manner set forth in
Section 4.1, which notice shall specify the record date, if any, with respect
to any such action and the approximate date on which such action is to take
place. Such notice shall also set forth the facts with respect thereto as
shall be reasonably necessary to indicate the effect on the Exercise Price and
the number, kind or class of shares or other securities or property which
shall be deliverable upon exercise of a Warrant. In the case of any action
which would require the fixing of a record date, such notice shall be given at
least ten (10) days prior to the date so fixed, and in case of all other
action, such notice shall be given at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
taking of such proposed action. Failure to give such notice, or any defect
therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of any such action.

 



 

SECTION 2.11 _Proceedings Prior to Any Action Requiring Adjustment_. As a
condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an
adjustment pursuant to this Article II, the Company shall take any action
which may be necessary, including obtaining regulatory, New York Stock
Exchange, NASDAQ Stock Market or other applicable national

 



 

9  

    
 

 



 

securities exchange or stockholder approvals or exemptions, in order that the
Company may thereafter validly and legally issue as fully paid and
nonassessable all Warrant Shares that a Holder is entitled to receive upon
exercise of a Warrant pursuant to this Article II.

 



 

SECTION 2.12 _Adjustment Rules_. Any adjustments pursuant to this Article II
shall be made successively whenever an event referred to herein shall occur.
If an adjustment in Exercise Price made under this Agreement would reduce the
Exercise Price per share of Common Stock to an amount below par value of the
Common Stock, then such adjustment in Exercise Price made under this Agreement
shall reduce the Exercise Price per share of Common Stock to the par value of
the Common Stock.

 



 

SECTION 2.13 _Prohibited Actions_. The Company agrees that it will not take
any action which would entitle a Holder to an adjustment of the Exercise Price
if the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable after such action upon
exercise of the Warrants, together with all shares of Common Stock then
outstanding and all shares of Common Stock then issuable upon the exercise of
all outstanding options, warrants, conversion and other rights, would exceed
the total number of shares of Common Stock then authorized by its certificate
of incorporation.

 



 

SECTION 2.14 _Adjustmen t to Warrant Certificate_. The form of Warrant
Certificate need not be changed because of any adjustment made pursuant to the
Warrant Certificate, and Warrant Certificates issued after such adjustment may
state the same Exercise Price and the same Exercise Number as are stated in
the Warrant Certificates initially issued pursuant to this Agreement. The
Company, however, may at any time in its sole discretion make any change in
the form of Warrant Certificate that it may deem appropriate to give effect to
such adjustments and that does not affect the substance of the Warrant
Certificate, and any Warrant Certificate thereafter issued or countersigned,
whether in exchange or substitution for an outstanding Warrant Certificate or
otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.

respect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a supplement or amendment to this
Agreement may be made by one or more substantially concurrent written
instruments duly signed by the Holders of a majority of the then outstanding
Warrants and delivered to the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the

This certifies that, for value received, [ ] or registered assigns (the "
_Holder_ "), is entitled to purchase from Kinder Morgan, Inc., a Delaware

_Exercise Price_ "), the number of shares of Class P common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Common Stock_ "), shown above. The
number of shares purchasable upon exercise of the Common Stock Purchase
Warrants (the " _Warrants_ ") and the Exercise Price are subject to adjustment
from time to time as set forth in the Warrant Agreement (as defined below).

 



 

The Warrants may be exercised in whole or in part by presentation of this
Warrant Certificate with the Notice of Exercise on the reverse side hereof
duly executed and simultaneous payment of the Exercise Price at the principal
office of [ ] (the " _Warrant Agent_ "). Payment of such price shall be
made, at the option of the Holder, either (i) in cash or by certified or
official bank check payable to the Warrant Agent or (ii) by delivering a
written direction to the Warrant Agent that the Holder desires to exercise
Warrants pursuant to a "cashless exercise," in which case the Holder will
receive a number of shares of Common Stock that is equal to the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock for which the Warrants are being exercised
less the number of shares of Common Stock that have an aggregate Market Price
(as defined in the Warrant Agreement) on the trading day on which such
Warrants are exercised that is equal to the aggregate Exercise Price. The
Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock that may be purchased
upon the exercise of the Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate are
subject to modification and adjustment in accordance with the terms of the
Warrant Agreement.

 



 

This Warrant Certificate is issued under and in accordance with a Warrant
Agreement, dated as of [ ], 201[ ], by and between the Company and [
] (the " _Warrant Agreement_ "), and is subject to the terms and provisions
contained in the Warrant Agreement, to all of which the Holder by acceptance
hereof consents. A copy of the Warrant Agreement may be obtained by the Holder
upon written request to the Company or at the office of the Warrant Agent.

 



 

Upon any partial exercise of the Warrants evidenced by this Warrant
Certificate, there shall be countersigned and issued to the Holder a new
Warrant Certificate in respect of the

      
 

 



 

shares of Common Stock as to which the Warrants evidenced by this Warrant
Certificate shall not have been exercised. This Warrant Certificate may be
exchanged at the office of the Warrant Agent by surrender of this Warrant
Certificate properly endorsed either separately or in combination with one or
more other Warrant Certificates for one or more new Warrant Certificates
evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase the same aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock as were purchasable on exercise of the Warrants
evidenced by the Warrant Certificate or Certificates exchanged. No fractional
shares will be issued upon the exercise of any Warrant, but the Company will
pay the cash value thereof determined as provided in the Warrant Agreement.

 



 

The Holder may be treated by the Company, the Warrant Agent and all other
persons dealing with this Warrant Certificate as the absolute owner hereof.

 



 

The Warrants may be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged, encumbered or in any
other manner transferred or disposed of, in whole or in part, but only in
accordance with the terms of the Warrant Agreement and in compliance with all
applicable laws.

 



 

This Warrant Certificate shall not be valid or obligatory for any purpose
until it shall have been countersigned by the Warrant Agent.
