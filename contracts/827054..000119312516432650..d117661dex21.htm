This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of January 19, 2016 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and among Microchip Technology Incorporated, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Hero Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Atmel Corporation, a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined
where first used have the respective meanings ascribed to them in _Section
8.3(e)_.

 

RECITALS

A. The respective Boards of Directors of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
have determined that the transactions described herein are in the best
interests of their respective companies and stockholders and, accordingly, the
Board of Directors of the Company and Parent have agreed to effect the merger
of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "),
whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), other than any shares
of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or any direct or indirect subsidiary
of Parent or held in the treasury of the Company, will be converted into the
right to receive (i) $7.00 in cash and (ii) an amount of shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Parent Shares_ ") with $1.15 in value, subject to
_Section 2.1_.

B. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
determined that the Merger is advisable and fair to the Company and its
stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders_ ").

 

C. The Board of Directors of Parent (the " _Parent Board_ ") has determined
that the Merger is advisable and fair to Parent and its stockholders (the "
_Parent Stockholders_ ").

D. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company, (a) the Company is terminating that certain Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of September 19, 2015, by and among Dialog Semiconductor
plc, Avengers Acquisition Corporation and the Company (as amended, the "
_Dialog Merger Agreement_ ") in accordance with its terms and (b) the Company
is paying to Dialog Semiconductor plc, pursuant to _Section 7.5(b)(i)_ of the
Dialog Merger Agreement, the termination fee of $137,300,000 in cash (the "
_Dialog Termination Fee_ ").

E. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also
to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, Company, Parent and Merger Sub, in consideration of the
representations, warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement, agree
as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the satisfaction or, if
permitted, waiver of the conditions set forth herein, and in accordance with
the DGCL, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company at the Effective
Time, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will thereupon cease.
Following the Effective Time, the Company will be the surviving company (the
" _Surviving Company_ ").

 



1 1.2 _Closing_.

 

(a) Except as set forth in _Section 1.2(b)_, the closing of the Merger (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place at the offices of Jones Day, 1755 Embarcadero
Road, Palo Alto, California, at 8:00 a.m. (California time), no later than the
second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of
those conditions), or at such other place, date and time as the Company and
Parent may agree in writing. The earliest date on which the conditions
specified in _Sections 6.1, 6.2_ and _6.3(d)_ have been satisfied (other than
the condition specified in _Section 6.2(b)_ insofar as such condition relates
to the Companys compliance with  _Section 5.4(e)(ii)_) is the "
_Satisfaction Date_." The date on which the Closing actually takes place, as
may be extended by _Section 1.2(b)_, is referred to as the " _Closing Date_."

 

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 1.2(a)_ and any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if by operation of  _Section 1.2(a)_ the Closing
Date would occur within the last 15 days of a calendar quarter (the "
_Deferral Quarter_ "), then Parent may elect in its sole discretion (no more
than a single time), by written notice to the Company (the " _Deferral
Notice_ "), to defer the Closing to the first Business Day occurring
immediately after the end of the Deferral Quarter. In the event of the
delivery of a Deferral Notice or a Cooperation Request, the conditions set
forth in _Sections 6.2(a)_ , _6.2(c)_ (insofar as such condition relates to
_Section 6.2(a)_) and _6.2(d)_ shall be deemed to be fully satisfied from and
after the Satisfaction Date through and including the Closing (if such
conditions were satisfied at the Satisfaction Date), without regard to any
change in circumstances or other events that may occur after the Satisfaction
Date, and Parent shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived as of the
Satisfaction Date all rights to assert such conditions.

1.3 _Effective Time_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, (i) as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties
shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such
form as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and the terms of this Agreement and (ii) as soon as
practicable on or after the Closing Date, the parties shall make all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger will become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on the Closing Date, or at such
subsequent date or time as the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes
effective is hereinafter referred to as the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will be vested in the Surviving
Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub
will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company all as
provided in the DGCL.

 

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Company Charter in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
amended so as to read in its entirety as set forth on _Exhibit A_ and, as so
amended, shall be from and after the Effective Time the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Company until amended in accordance
with applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Company from and after the Effective Time, until amended in
accordance with applicable Law. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of
the Company Charter and Company Bylaws and any Contracts between a director,
officer or employee of the Company and the Company in effect as of immediately
prior to the Closing will govern the rights of all directors, officers and
employees of the Company (including, without limitation, persons who were, at
any time, directors, officers and employees

 



2  of the Company prior to Closing), as applicable, and the obligations of the
Company and the Surviving Company, in respect of claims for indemnification
based in whole or in part on actions or failures to take action at or prior
to the Closing, and neither the amendments thereto contemplated hereby or any
amendments or modifications, if any, effected following the Closing will
affect, in any manner, the rights of any directors, officers and employees,
or the obligations of the Company, including the Surviving Company, thereunder
relating to such actions or failures to take action.

 

1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Company_. From and after the
Effective Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
in accordance with applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Company and (ii) the
officers of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the
Surviving Company.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY; EXCHANGE

 

OF CERTIFICATES AND PAYMENT

 

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any securities of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Sub s Capital Stock_. Each share of common stock of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into and become one share of common stock of the Surviving Company with the
same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Company, subject to _Section 2.1(b)_.

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent Owned Stock and Conversion of
Subsidiary Owned Stock_. (i) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned
by Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time and any Company Common Stock
held in the treasury of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
will automatically be canceled and retired and will cease to exist, and no
consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor and (ii) each share of
Company Common Stock held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Company such that each such Subsidiary
owns the same percentage of the outstanding capital stock of the
Surviving Company immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary
owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(c)  _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.2(b)_ and
_Section 2.2(e)_, each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock,
other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled or converted
in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares to be treated in
accordance with _Section 2.4_ , will be converted into the right to receive:

 

(i) $7.00 in cash without interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ");

 

(ii) a fraction of a Parent Share (the " _Stock Consideration_ ") equal to the
lesser of (A) the quotient of (x) $1.15, _divided by_ (y) the Average Parent
Closing Price (the " _Implied Exchange Ratio_ ") and (B) the quotient of
13,000,000 _divided by_ the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
(other than shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled or converted in
accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_) outstanding as of the Effective Time (the "
_Maximum Exchange Ratio_ ", and such fraction as determined under this 
_Section 2.1(c)(ii)_, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "); and

(iii) in the event that the Implied Exchange Ratio exceeds the Maximum
Exchange Ratio, an amount of cash equal to (A) the Implied Exchange Ratio
_minus_ the Maximum Exchange Ratio, _multiplied by_ (B) the Average Parent
Closing Price (the " _Supplemental Cash Consideration_ ").

 



3 (d) _Cancellation of Shares of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective
Time, all shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
will automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate formerly representing any shares of Company Common
Stock (a " _Company Certificate_ ") or shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, certain dividends or other distributions, if any, upon
surrender or transfer of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, in
each case, in accordance with this _Article II_, without interest.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Closing Date, Parent will designate a U.S.
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent of
Parent for purposes of, among other things, mailing and receiving transmittal
letters, and distributing the Merger Consideration to the Company Stockholders
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or substantially concurrently with the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock, for payment and exchange in accordance with this _Article II_ through
the Exchange Agent, (i) a number of Parent Shares equal to the aggregate
number of Parent Shares to be issued as Merger Consideration, and (ii)
immediately available funds sufficient to pay the aggregate Cash
Consideration, Supplemental Cash Consideration, and any cash payable in lieu
of any fractional Parent Shares, in each case to be held by the Exchange Agent
in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock (such
Parent Shares, funds and any dividends or other distributions payable in
accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_ being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). No later than 10 Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to effect the applicable
terms of this Agreement.

(b)  _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) Promptly, and in any event within 10 Business Days, after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of a Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share whose shares of Company Common
Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (A) a
letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Company Certificates will pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of
Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter
of transmittal, and such letter of transmittal will be in customary form and
have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify consistent with
this Agreement) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Company Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the transfer of
such Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 

(ii) After the Effective Time, and reasonably promptly following surrender or
transfer in accordance with this _Article II_ of a Company Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration in the form of (A) the number of
whole Parent Shares that such holder has the right to

  



4  receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_, after taking into
account all the shares of Company Common Stock then held by such holder under
all such Book-Entry Shares or Company Certificates so surrendered or
transferred, and (B) a check or wire for the full amount of cash that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_, including the Cash Consideration, Supplemental Cash Consideration, cash
in lieu of fractional Parent Shares, and certain dividends or other
distributions, if any, in accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_, in each case less
any required withholding of Taxes, and the Company Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares so surrendered or transferred will forthwith be canceled, and Parents
stock transfer books shall be updated accordingly. The Parent Shares shall be
accepted into The Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") and issued in
uncertificated book-entry form to such account as shall be specified in the
completed letter of transmittal. If payment of the Merger Consideration (along
with any cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares as provided in _Section
2.2(e)_ and any unpaid dividends and other distributions with respect to such
Parent Shares as provided in _Section 2.2(c)_) is to be made to a person
other than the person in whose name the surrendered Company Certificate or
Book-Entry Shares so transferred is registered on the stock transfer books of
the Company or the systems of DTC, as the case may be, it will be a condition
of payment that (1) the Company Certificate so surrendered or the Book-Entry
Shares so transferred will be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form
for transfer, and (2) the person requesting such payment (x) will have paid
all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Company
Certificate surrendered or Book-Entry Shares so transferred or (y) will have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Company and the Exchange
Agent that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered or transferred as contemplated by this _Section 2.2(b)_, each
Company Certificate and each Book-Entry Share will be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender
or transfer the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to
receive in respect of such Company Certificate pursuant to the provisions of
this _Article II_ and certain dividends or other distributions, if any, in
accordance with _Section 2.2(c)_. No interest will be paid or will accrue on
any Merger Consideration or unpaid dividends and other distributions, if any,
payable to holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article II_.

(c) _Dividends; Other Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
with respect to Parent Shares with a record date after the Effective Time will
be paid to the holder of any Company Certificate or Book-Entry Shares that
have not been surrendered or transferred with respect to the Parent Shares
represented thereby and no cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Shares
will be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section 2.2(e)_, and all such
dividends, other distributions and cash in lieu of fractional Parent Shares
will be paid by Parent to the Exchange Agent and will be included in the
Exchange Fund, in each case until the surrender or transfer of such Company
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject
to the effect of applicable escheat or similar Laws, following surrender or
transfer of any such Company Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance
herewith, (A) there will be paid to the holder of whole Parent Shares issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, in addition to all other amounts to
which such holder is entitled under this _Article II_, (i) at the time of
such surrender or transfer, the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such whole Parent Shares and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a
fractional Parent Share to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section
2.2(e)_ and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to such
surrender or transfer payable with respect to such whole Parent Shares and
(B) Parent shall pay or cause the Surviving Company to pay all dividends or
other distributions, in each case with a record date prior to the Effective
Time, that have been declared or made by the Company with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
but that have not been paid on such shares.

 



5 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Parent Shares
issued and all Cash Consideration and Supplemental Cash Consideration paid
upon the surrender or transfer for exchange of Company Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ (including any
cash paid pursuant to  _Section 2.2(c)_ and _Section 2.2(e)_) will be
deemed to have been issued or paid, as the case may be, in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Company Certificates and such Book-Entry Shares, and
there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Surviving Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to Parent, the
Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they will be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_.

 

(i) No certificates, receipts or scrip representing fractional Parent Shares
shall be issued upon the surrender or transfer for exchange of Company
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or distribution of Parent will
relate to such fractional Parent Shares and such fractional Parent Shares will
not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a Parent
Stockholder.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
Company Common Stock converted pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise be
entitled to receive a fraction of a Parent Share (after taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock held at the Effective Time by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu thereof, from the Exchange Agent, a cash payment in
United States dollars in lieu of such fractional Parent Share either (A)
representing that holders proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the
sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions of the aggregate of the
fractional Parent Shares which would otherwise have been issued under this
_Article II_ (the " _Excess Parent Shares_ ") or (B) cash in accordance with
_Section 2.2(e)(iii)_ below. The sale of the Excess Parent Shares shall
be (A) executed on The NASDAQ Stock Market and (B) made at such times, in
such manner and on such terms as the Exchange Agent shall determine in its
reasonable discretion. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been
distributed to the holders of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with this _Section 2.2_, the Exchange Agent shall hold the net
proceeds in trust (the " _Exchange Trust_ ") for those holders. All
commissions, fees, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket transaction costs,
including the expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in
connection with the sale of the Excess Parent Shares shall be paid by Parent
and the Surviving Company. As soon as practicable after the determination of
the amount of cash to be paid to holders of Company Certificates and Book-
Entry Shares in lieu of fractional Parent Shares, the Exchange Agent shall
make that amount available to those holders, without interest. The Exchange
Agent shall determine the portion of the net proceeds to which each holder of
Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled by multiplying the
aggregate amount of the net proceeds by a fraction of which (1) the numerator
is the amount of the fractional Parent Shares to which such holder of Company
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares is entitled (after taking into account all
Company Certificates delivered by such holder) and (2) the denominator is the
aggregate amount of fractional Parent Shares to which all holders of Company
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares are entitled.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 2.2(e)(ii)_ , Parent may
elect, at its option exercised prior to the Effective Time, to pay to the
Exchange Agent an amount in cash in United States dollars, to be deposited
promptly following the Effective Time, sufficient for the Exchange Agent to
pay each holder of Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares an amount in cash
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the fraction of a Parent
Share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled by (B) the
closing price for a Parent Share on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the first
Business Day immediately following the Effective Time. In such event, all
references in this Agreement to the net proceeds from the sale of the Excess
Parent Shares and similar references shall be deemed to refer to the payments
calculated in the manner set forth in this  _Section 2.2(e)(iii)_.

 



6 (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund and Exchange Trust_. Any portion of the
Exchange Fund or the Exchange Trust that remains undistributed to the holders
of the Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one year after the
Effective Time will be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of
Company Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not theretofore complied
with this _Article II_ may thereafter look only to Parent (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors
thereof for payment of their claim for Merger Consideration and any dividends
or distributions, if any, with respect to Parent Shares. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Company or
its designee, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent will be liable to any person in respect of any Parent Shares,
any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares or any cash from the Exchange Fund or Exchange Trust,
in each case, delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(h) _Investment of Exchange Fund and Exchange Trust_. The Exchange Agent will
invest any cash in the Exchange Fund and Exchange Trust as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash will in all
events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances
of commercial banks with capital exceeding $25 billion (based on the most
recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available),
and that no such investment or loss thereon will affect the amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments will be paid to Parent. In the event that the Exchange Fund and
Exchange Trust is insufficient to make the payments contemplated by this 
_Article II_, Parent will, or will cause the Surviving Company, promptly to
deposit additional funds with the Exchange Agent in an amount that is equal to
the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Exchange Fund
and Exchange Trust will not be used for any purpose not expressly provided
for in this Agreement.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such customary
and reasonable amount as the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Company
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Certificate, the Merger Consideration and, if
applicable, any unpaid dividends and distributions on Parent Shares
deliverable in respect thereof, due to such person pursuant to this Agreement.

 

2.3 _Certain Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock, or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of capital stock, of the Company or Parent shall occur
as a result of any merger, business combination,
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, the Merger Consideration, the 

 



7  Exchange Ratio, and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be,
shall be equitably adjusted, without duplication, to provide the holders of
Company Common Stock (or such rights that are convertible into shares of
Company Common Stock) the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 2.3_
shall be construed to permit either the Company or Parent to take any action
with respect to its respective securities that is prohibited or not expressly
permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

 

2.4 _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, including _Section 2.1(c)_, shares of Company Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
cancelled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_) and held by a record holder or
beneficial owner who has not voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or
consented thereto in writing and who is statutorily entitled to exercise
appraisal rights and who duly complies with all provisions of Section 262 of
the DGCL concerning the right of holders of shares of Company Common Stock to
dissent from the Merger and seek appraisal of their shares of Company Common
Stock (such shares being referred to collectively as the " _Dissenting Shares_
" until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such
holders dissenters rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock) will not be converted into a right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead will be entitled to only such rights as
are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if,
after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses
such holders appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a
court of competent jurisdiction determines that such holder is not entitled
to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such shares of Company
Common Stock will be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
_Section 2.1(c)_, without interest thereon and less any required withholding
taxes, upon surrender or transfer of such Company Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock in the
manner provided in _Section 2.2(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if the Merger is rescinded or abandoned prior to
the Effective Time, then the right of any stockholder of the Company to be
paid the fair value of such holders Dissenting Shares pursuant to Section 262
of the DGCL will be null and void. The Company will provide Parent prompt
written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of shares
of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that relates to such demand, and
Parent will have the opportunity and right to direct and control all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of Parent or to the extent required by Law, the Company
will not make any payment with respect to, or settle or agree or offer to
settle, any such demands.

2.5 _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Company will be authorized to execute and deliver,
in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf
of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company as a result of, or
in connection with, the Merger.

2.6 _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any person such
amounts, if any, as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of applicable Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely remitted to the
appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such person in respect of
which such deduction and 

 



8  withholding was made by the Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent,
as the case may be. The Surviving Company, Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
the case may be, shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so
withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the period required under
applicable Tax Law. In the case of any proposed withholding under Section 1445
of the Code, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide to
the Company written notice of such proposed withholding at least 14 Business
Days prior to the Closing in order to allow the Company to deliver to Parent
appropriate certifications exempting payment of the Merger Consideration from
withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

direct the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the

Law.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_ , from all times
commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing
until the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms (the "
_No-Shop Period_ "), the Company and its Subsidiaries will not, and the
Company will not authorize, direct or knowingly permit its
Representatives to, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage the making
of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
result in, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in, enter into,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Person with respect to, or provide any non-public information or data
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person relating to, any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result
in, a Company Acquisition Proposal (for avoidance of doubt, it being
understood that the foregoing will not prohibit the Company or the Companys
Representatives from making such Person aware of the restrictions of this
_Section_ _5.3_ in response to the receipt of a Company Acquisition Proposal),
(iii) enter into any acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar
definitive agreement, or any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
agreement in principle or any other agreement (other than an Acceptable
Company Confidentiality Agreement) relating to a Company Acquisition Proposal
(an " _Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement_ "), or (iv)
authorize, adopt, approve or recommend or publicly propose to authorize,
adopt, approve or recommend to the Company Stockholders, or submit to the
Company Stockholders for a vote at any stockholder meeting, any Company
Acquisition Proposal. Immediately after the execution of this Agreement, the
Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to, cease
any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to any Company
Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_ ,
at any time prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, if the
Company receives a _bona fide_ Company Acquisition Proposal from any Person
that did not result from a material breach of _Section 5.3(a)_ , the Company
and its Representatives may contact such Person to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof and (i) the Company and its Representatives may provide
information (including non-public information and data) regarding, and afford
access to the business, properties, assets, books, records and personnel of,
the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person if the Company receives from
such Person (or has received from such Person) an executed Acceptable Company
Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_ that the Company will promptly (and in
any event within 24 hours) make available to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any
Person given such access that was not previously made available to Parent and
(ii) the Company and its Representatives may engage in, enter into, continue
or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person
with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal, as long as (A) the Company
has not materially breached  _Section 5.3(a)_ with respect to such Company
Acquisition Proposal and (B) prior to taking any action described in clauses
(i) or (ii) above, the Company Board determines in good faith that (1) such
Company Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Company Superior Proposal
or would reasonably be expected to result in a Company Superior Proposal and
(2) the failure to participate in such discussions or negotiations or furnish
such information would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(c) During the No-Shop Period, the Company will promptly after knowledge by
the Company of receipt (and in any event within 24 hours after knowledge of
receipt), notify Parent both orally and in writing of the receipt by the
Company of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for information
from, or any negotiations sought to be initiated or resumed with, either the
Company or its Representatives concerning a Company Acquisition Proposal,
which notice will include a written summary of the material terms of any
Company Acquisition Proposal not made in writing or any such inquiry or
request and provide a copy of such Company Acquisition Proposal (if made in
writing). The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt basis
(and in any event within 24 hours after knowledge of receipt) of any material
developments regarding any Company Acquisition Proposal.

 



35 (d) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.3(d)_, the Company Board will
not (i) (A) change, withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Parent (or publicly propose or resolve to change, withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify), the Company Recommendation, (B) fail to include
the Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (C) publicly
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend to the
Company Stockholders, a Company Acquisition Proposal, or (D) if (1) a tender
offer or exchange offer for shares of capital stock of the Company that
constitutes a Company Acquisition Proposal is commenced or (2) a Company
Acquisition Proposal is otherwise publicly announced, fail to recommend
against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer by the Company
Stockholders or against such Company Acquisition Proposal within 10 Business
Days after commencement or announcement thereof (any of the foregoing, a "
_Company Change of Recommendation_ ") or (ii) authorize, adopt, approve or
publicly propose to authorize, adopt or approve or recommend, or enter into,
any Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement (x) constituting or relating to
a Company Acquisition Proposal or (y) requiring the Company to abandon,
terminate, or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, the Company Board may (I) without excluding the
Company Boards right to act in accordance with clause (II), effect a Company
Change of Recommendation that does not relate to a Company Acquisition
Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that, as a result of an event, development or
change in circumstances that occurs or arises after the execution and delivery
of this Agreement (other than a Company Acquisition Proposal) that was
not known (or the consequences of which were not known) to the Company Board
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (a " _Company
Intervening Event_ "), the failure to effect a Company Change of
Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (II) without excluding
the Company Boards right to act in accordance with clause (I), effect a
Company Change of Recommendation if the Company receives a Company
Acquisition Proposal and the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors) that the Company
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that the
failure to effect a Company Change of Recommendation would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may take
the actions described in (1) clause (II) only if the Company (A) has not
materially breached _Section 5.3(a)_ , _Section 5.3(b)_ or _Section 5.3(c)_
with respect to such Company Acquisition Proposal and (B) terminates
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ concurrently with entering into
such Alternative Company Acquisition Agreement and pays the Company
Termination Fee in compliance with _Section 7.5(b)_ and (2) clauses (I) or
(II) if:

 

(y) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent (which notice
itself will not constitute a Company Change of Recommendation) of its or the
Company Boards intention to take such actions at least four Business Days in
advance of taking such action, which notice will specify, as applicable, the
material circumstances of such Company Intervening Event or the information
and documents required to be furnished pursuant to _Section 5.3(c)_ ; and

(z) the Company Board has considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement or other arrangements that may be offered in writing by, and would
be legally binding upon, Parent by 5:00 PM California time on the fourth
Business Day after the Company has provided the notice described in the
preceding clause (y) and shall have determined in good faith (A) with respect
to the actions described in clause (II), after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisors, that the Company Acquisition Proposal
received by the Company continues to constitute a Company Superior Proposal
and (B) with respect to the actions described in clause

 



36  (I), after consultation with outside counsel, that it would continue to
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law not to effect the Company Change of Recommendation, in
each case, if such changes offered in writing by Parent in a definitive
agreement were given effect. In the event of any amendment to the financial
terms or any other material revisions to the Company Superior Proposal, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent pursuant
to the preceding clause (y) and to comply with the requirements of this clause
(z) with respect to such new written notice, except the notice period shall
be at least two Business Days (rather than the four Business Days contemplated
by clause (y) and this clause (z)).

(e) Subject to the proviso in this _Section 5.3(e)_ , nothing contained in
this _Section 5.3_ will be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board
from (i) taking such actions as the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel are required to comply with its
disclosure obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to a
Company Acquisition Proposal or Company Intervening Event, including taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position required or
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to stockholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or (ii) publishing any "stop-
look-and-listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act (or any similar communications to the Company Stockholders), with any
"stop-look-and-listen" communication not being deemed to be a Company Change
of Recommendation; _provided_ that neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof will effect a Company Change of Recommendation unless the applicable
requirements of _Section 5.3(d)_ have been satisfied.

 

5.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will use (and cause its Affiliates to use)
its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with, applicable
Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions, and to do

from third parties and all consents, approvals and waivers from third parties
reasonably requested by Parent or the Company to be obtained in respect of

the failure to receive any such consents, approvals or waivers will not be a
condition to the obligations of the parties hereunder), (iii) the defending of
any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement, or the consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to
pay prior to the Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any
third party for any consent or approval required for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Contract or to incur
any material cost or expense in the performance hereof and that in no event
will Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay prior to the
Effective Time any fee, penalty or other consideration to any third party for

37 (b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent will (i) promptly, and
using their respective reasonable best efforts to make such initial filing by
the dates set forth on _Section 5.4(b)_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedule for
the jurisdictions listed therein, make their respective filings and
thereafter make any other required submissions under the HSR Act and any other
applicable foreign Antitrust Law, (ii) except in connection with a disclosure
by the Company regarding a Company Change of Recommendation or a Company
Acquisition Proposal received by the Company, use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with each other in (x) determining whether any filings are required
to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or approvals
are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other Governmental
Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) timely
making all such filings and timely seeking all such consents, permits,
authorizations or approvals, (iii) promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any material communication from the Antitrust Division of the
United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv)
subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated thereby, including
promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or other communications
received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger. Except in connection with a disclosure by the Company regarding a
Company Change of Recommendation or a Company Acquisition Proposal received by
the Company, the Company and Parent will permit counsel for the other party
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other party in connection with, any proposed material written
communication to any Governmental Entity. Each of the Company and Parent
agrees not to (A) participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either
in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
proposed transactions unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent practicable and not prohibited by such Governmental Entity,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate, (B) extend
any waiting period under the HSR Act without the prior written consent of the
other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), or (C) enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior
written consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.4_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the Company and Parent
will cooperate in all respects with each other and will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or proceeding
and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the purpose of the preceding
sentence, reasonable best efforts includes using their reasonable best efforts
to (i) effect any sale, license, holding separate or other disposition of any
of their respective assets, businesses or interests and (ii) agree to
conditions relating to or changes in the conduct of their respective
businesses necessary to obtain consents, permits, authorizations, waivers or
approvals required for the Closing under the Antitrust Laws, with any such
action to be conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, however, in no event shall Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries be obligated to commit to
any actions, and, without the prior written consent of Parent, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall consent to or take any actions,
including to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of any assets,
businesses or interests or agree to conditions relating to or changes in the
conduct of its business, that would reduce the reasonably

 



38  anticipated benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in an amount that is financially material relative to the value of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as a whole. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.4_ will
limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.2_
so long as such party has, prior to such termination, complied with its
obligations under this _Section 5.4_.

(d) Parent shall prepare promptly and submit to the French Ministry of the
Economy within 15 calendar days after the date of this Agreement a completed
application requesting authorization for a foreign investment in France
pursuant to and in accordance with the French Foreign Investment Laws (the "
_French Foreign Investment Application_ "). The Company shall cooperate with
Parent in its preparation of the application, including by providing it
promptly with all documents and information regarding the relevant
Subsidiary(ies) of the Company as are required to complete the French Foreign
Investment Application. Parent shall keep the Company informed promptly of (i)
any communications, whether written or oral, of the French Ministry of the
Economy concerning the French Foreign Investment Application or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement generally, (ii) any proposed
meetings or calls with the French Ministry of the Economy, and (iii) the
results of any meetings or calls with the French Ministry of the Economy.
Parent shall, after coordination with the Company, provide the Company with
the opportunity to participate, to the extent practical, in any meetings or
calls with the French Ministry of the Economy. Parent shall promptly respond
to all questions and requests for information by the French Ministry of the
Economy.

(e) Company Cooperation.

 

(i) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the Effective
Time or (ii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated, subject to the
Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement and the other provisions of this
_Section_ 5.4(e), the Company shall (x) to the extent reasonably practicable
and without a requirement for the Company to engage external advisors in
connection with the preparation thereof, provide information reasonably
requested by Parent in connection with any Tax planning or Tax integration
undertaken by Parent for purposes of efficiently consummating the
Merger, including, without limitation, in respect of the valuation of Atmel
Trading Company, Ltd., and (y) cooperate in good faith with Parent in relation
to Tax planning and Tax integration matters that may be reasonably requested
by Parent for purposes of efficiently consummating the Merger (other than the
actions specifically set forth on _Section 5.4(e)(ii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, which shall be governed solely by _Section 5.4(e)(ii)_.

 

(ii) From the Satisfaction Date until the Closing, upon the written request of
Parent (any such request being referred to as a " _Cooperation Request_ "),
the Company shall take the actions specifically set forth on _Section
5.4(e)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. In the event of the delivery
of a Cooperation Request, the conditions set forth in _Sections 6.2(a)_ ,
_6.2(c)_ (insofar as such condition relates to _Section 6.2(a)_) and _6.2(d)_
shall be deemed to be fully satisfied from and after the Satisfaction Date
through and including the Closing (if such conditions were satisfied at the
Satisfaction Date), without regard to any change in circumstances or other
events that may occur after the Satisfaction Date, and Parent shall be deemed
to have irrevocably waived on the Satisfaction Date all rights to assert such
conditions.

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances will the failure or
refusal to take any actions requested by Parent under _Section 5.4(e)(i)(y)_
that could, in the sole determination of the Company, (x) have an adverse
effect on the Company or (y) be incapable of completion within five Business
Days after the Satisfaction Date or otherwise result in a delay in Closing of
more than five Business Days be deemed to be a breach by the Company of its
obligations under this _Section 5.4(e)_, and, in no event, shall any such
failure, refusal, or inability, to take the actions requested

 



39  by Parent under _Section 5.4(e)(i)(y)_ form the basis for any termination
by Parent or Merger Sub of this Agreement, any failure of the conditions set
forth in  _Section 6.2(b)_ to be satisfied, or any claim for damages or
expenses by Parent or Merger Sub. Nothing in this _Section 5.4(e)(iii)_
limits the Companys obligation to take any actions specifically set forth
on  _Section 5.4(e)(ii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule to the extent
required by _Section 5.4(e)(ii)_.

5.5 _Advice of Changes_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall
promptly advise the other parties to this Agreement orally and in writing to
the extent it has knowledge of any change or event having a Parent Material
Adverse Effect or any change or event reasonably likely to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of Parent, or a Company Material
Adverse Effect or any change or event reasonably likely to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in the case of the Company, or the ability of
the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such notification or failure to deliver such notification
will affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to
the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

5.6 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus;
Company Stockholders Meeting_.

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
(i) Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC (and
each shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such filing to occur
within 30 days of the date of this Agreement) the proxy statement/prospectus
(as part of the Form S-4) that includes (A) a prospectus for the issuance of
Parent Shares in the Merger and (B) a proxy statement of the Company for use
in the solicitation of proxies for the Company Stockholders Meeting (such
proxy statement/prospectus, as amended or supplemented from time to time, the
" _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ "), and (ii) Parent shall prepare and file with
the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included

efforts (i) to cause the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to comply
with the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC, (ii) to
promptly notify the other of, cooperate with each other with respect to, and

Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as

through the Closing in order to permit the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Company
Stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared
effective under the Securities Act. Parent and the Company will promptly
provide all information concerning such entity to the other, and provide such
other assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and Proxy
Statement/Prospectus (including that the Company shall cooperate in the
preparation of any pro forma financial statements required to be included in
the Form S-4 and Proxy Statement/Prospectus). No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by the
Company or Parent, in each case, without providing the other party and its
respective counsel the reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon
and giving due consideration to such comments. Notwithstanding the immediately
preceding sentence and to the extent permitted under _Section 5.3(d)_ , the
Company may amend or supplement (and Parent will, at the Companys request,
amend or supplement) the Form S-4 or Proxy Statement/Prospectus to effect a
Company Change of Recommendation. Parent shall also take any other action
required to be taken under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and any
applicable foreign or state securities or "blue sky" laws that are required to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties shall
notify each other promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff and any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments

 



40  or supplements to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4, or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between such party or any of its representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or its staff on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, the Form S-4 or the Merger. Parent will advise the
Company, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the Form
S-4 has become effective or any supplement or amendment thereto has been
filed, the issuance of any stop order or the suspension of the qualification
of the Parent Shares issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction and Parent and the Company will use reasonable best
efforts to have any stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise
terminated. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates,
officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment
or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

 

(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following the date the Form S-4
is declared effective by the SEC (and in no event later than 45 days
following the date the Form S-4 is declared effective by the SEC), duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold, at its option, either an annual or special
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ")
in accordance with applicable Law, the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws
for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and, in the case
of an annual meeting of stockholders, for the other purposes as may be
appropriate for an annual meeting of stockholders. Subject to _Section
5.3(d)_, the Company shall (A) through the Company Board, recommend to its
stockholders the approval and adoption of this Agreement, the Merger and the
other the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and include in the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus such recommendation and (B) subject to _Section
5.3(d)_, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such approval
and adoption. Subject to  _Section 5.3(d)_ , the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from its
stockholders proxies in favor of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the matters subject to the Company Stockholder Approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and after
consultation with Parent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company
Stockholders Meeting if (and solely to the extent and for the minimum
duration reasonably necessary to ensure that): (1) any supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus required under applicable Law is
timely provided to the Company Stockholders within a reasonable amount of time
in advance of the Company Stockholders Meeting or (2) as of the time for
which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or
by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business to be
conducted at the Company Stockholders Meeting and to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval.

5.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

(a) For purposes of furthering the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) the date on which this Agreement is terminated, subject

Company shall, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to,
afford to the Representatives of the other party reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to all of its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records and all other information concerning
their business, properties and personnel as the other party may reasonably
request upon reasonable prior notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Parent nor the Company nor any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Representatives shall conduct or cause to be conducted any sampling, testing

this _Section 5.7_ shall affect any representation or warranty in this
Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the
parties hereto. With respect to all information furnished by one party to the
other party or its Representatives under this Agreement, the parties shall

Disclosure Agreement is hereby amended to permit the inclusion of all
Financing Sources (including convertible or equity-linked debt) (and
representatives of such Financing Sources) in the term "Representative" as
such term is defined therein.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.7_,
neither Parent nor the Company shall be required to (nor shall either of them
be required to cause their respective Subsidiaries to) provide any access, or
make available any document, correspondence or information, if doing so would,
in such partys and its outside legal counsels reasonable judgment, (i)
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) conflict with any (A) Law applicable to such party or any
of its Subsidiaries or the assets, or operation of the business, of such
party or any of its Subsidiaries or (B) Contract to which such party or any of

any press release or similar public announcement with respect to, or otherwise
make any public statement concerning, this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement without first consulting
with Parent, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by the
Company, or the Company, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement

will not apply to any press release or public statement (a) made or proposed
to be made by the Company in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal or

exchange (in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or
make such public statement shall use its reasonable efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party before issuing such press release or making
any such public statement). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 5.8_, (i) Parent and the Company may make press releases or public

42 5.9 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Company, its Subsidiaries and their permitted successors and assigns, to
honor and perform all employment or compensatory Contracts between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any Company Employee, on the
other (including all retention awards and employment, employment continuation,
severance, incentive, change in control and termination Contracts disclosed
in _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Assumed Equity
Awards (as defined in _Section 5.15(c)_ of this Agreement)).

 

(b) From the date of this Agreement through December 31, 2016 (the "
_Transition Period_ "), Parent will provide or cause to be provided to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time working
in the United States who continues employment with Parent or any of its direct
or indirect Subsidiaries (each, an " _Affected Employee_ "), while employed
by Parent or any of its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, compensation and
benefits the value of which is comparable in the aggregate to the aggregate
value of the compensation and benefits provided to such Affected Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding the value of any defined
benefit pension plan and the Company ESPP). During the Transition Period, (i)
each Affected Employee, while employed by the Parent or any of its direct or
indirect Subsidiaries, will be provided base wages or salary, as applicable,
that are not less than the base wages or salary, as applicable, provided to
such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
each Affected Employee will be provided severance benefits not less favorable
in amount or with regard to terms and conditions to receive such severance
benefits than those disclosed in _Section 3.10(a)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause any employee benefit
plans in which the Affected Employees are entitled to participate to take
into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and
benefit accrual (but not for benefit accrual purposes under any defined
benefit pension plan, unless required by Law) thereunder, service for the
Company and its Subsidiaries as if such service were with Parent, to the same
extent such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessor entities) prior to the
Effective Time (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of
benefits or compensation with respect to the same period of service), and
Affected Employees will be immediately eligible to participate in any such
plans, without any waiting period, to the extent such Affected Employee was
eligible to participate in the comparable Company plan immediately prior to
the Effective Time. To the extent any health benefit plan replaces a Company
Benefit Plan that is a health benefit plan during the Transition Period,
Parent will, and will cause its direct and indirect Subsidiaries (including
the Surviving Company) to (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
condition exclusions and all waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to each Affected Employee to the extent
waived or satisfied under the replaced Company Benefit Plan and (ii) credit
each Affected Employee for any applicable amounts (whether in the nature of
co-payments or coinsurance amounts, amounts applied toward deductibles or
other out-of-pocket expenses) under the terms of the replaced Company Benefit
Plan toward satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-pocket
requirements under the health benefit plan that replaces such a Company
Benefit Plan for the plan year in which the transition between plans occurs.

(d) Nothing contained in this  _Section 5.9_ or any other provision of this

Agreement, any benefit, compensation or severance plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement sponsored by the Company, Parent or their
Affiliates, (ii) will limit the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates to
amend, modify or terminate any benefit, compensation or severance plan,
program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement that is assumed,
established, sponsored or maintained by Parent or its Affiliates, _provided_

thereof and applicable Law, (iii) will create any 

 



43  third-party beneficiary rights or obligations in any Person (including any
Affected Employee) other than the parties to this Agreement, or (iv) will
limit the right of Parent (or its Subsidiaries) to terminate, in accordance
with applicable Law, the employment or service of any employee or other
service provider during the Transition Period.

 

(e) If requested by Parent at least 10 days prior to the Closing, then
effective as of no later than the day immediately preceding the Closing, the
Company will terminate each of the Company Benefit Plans intended to be
"qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code, in which case
Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide for the Microchip
Technology Incorporated Savings Plan, to accept, on or after Closing, the
rollover by Affected Employees of any "eligible rollover distribution" (within
the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Atmel Corporation Tax
Deferred Savings Plan, including plan loans, in accordance with applicable
Code provisions.

not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection

(a) To the fullest extent required or permitted by Law, for a period of six
years following the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Company to, indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses as incurred to,
in each case to the fullest extent required or permitted under applicable Law,
each current and former director or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries who, as of the date of this Agreement, is entitled to be
indemnified under the Company Charter or Company Bylaws as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against any costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Indemnified Partys service as a director,
officer or representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
services performed by such Persons at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including, for the avoidance
of doubt, in connection with (x) the Merger, the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the process and other events
giving rise thereto, and (y) actions to enforce this provision or any other
indemnification or advancement right of any Indemnified Party. In the event of
any such action, Parent and the Surviving Company will, and Parent will cause
the Surviving Company to, cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense
of any such action.

 

(b) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, Parent will cause
the Surviving Company to maintain in effect the provisions in its certificate
of incorporation and bylaws to the extent they provide for indemnification,
advancement and reimbursement of expenses and exculpation of Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, with respect to facts or circumstances occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, on the same basis as set forth in the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement, to the
fullest extent permitted from time to time by applicable Law, which provisions
will not be amended except as required by applicable Law or to make changes
permitted by applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of the Indemnified
Parties indemnification rights thereunder.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may obtain and fully pay the
premium for "tail" insurance policies for the extension of (i) the directors
and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and
officers insurance policies for the Indemnified Parties (and such other
persons who may be insureds under such policies) and (ii) the Companys
existing fiduciary and

 



44  employment practices liability insurance policies, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary and
employment practices liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_")
with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that are
at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties (and such other persons who
may be insureds under such policies) as the Companys existing policies with
respect to any matters that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby). Whether pursuant to such tail policy or
otherwise, the Surviving Company will continue to maintain in effect for a
period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time DandO Insurance
with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that
are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving Company
will use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such
six-year period with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage that are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided in the
Companys existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event will the Surviving Company be required to expend
for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess
of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Company will obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

(i) consolidates with or merges into any other corporation or entity and is
not the continuing or Surviving Company or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any individual, corporation or other entity, then, and in each such case,
unless provided by operation of Law, proper provisions will be made so that
the successors and assigns of the Surviving Company will assume all of the
obligations set forth in this _Section 5.11_. This _Section 5.11_ may not
be amended after the Effective Time in a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party unless such Indemnified Party will have consented in writing
to such amendment.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 5.11_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, who are
intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.11_ as of and following
the Effective Time.

(f) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Section 5.11_ will be
in addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. For a
period of six years following the Effective Time, all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any Indemnified Party as
provided in the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or comparable governing
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries will survive the Merger and will not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

5.12 _Takeover Statutes_. If any takeover statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and the Company Board each will use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law
on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 



45 5.13 _Section 16 Matters_. Parent and the Company shall take all steps
reasonably necessary to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including
derivative securities) or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including
derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by each individual
who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

5.14 _Parent Vote_. Parent will vote (or consent, by written action in lieu of
a meeting, with respect to) all voting stock of Merger Sub and all Company
Common Stock owned of record or beneficially by Parent or Parents
Subsidiaries in favor of the adoption of this Agreement by Merger Sub and the
Company and the consummation by Merger Sub and the Company of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.15 _Company Stock Options; Company Units; Company ESPP_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. At least 16 days prior to the Effective Time
(such period through the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, the "
_Option Notice Period_ "), the Company shall provide written notice to each
holder of a then-outstanding option to purchase Shares, whether vested or
unvested (a " _Company Stock Option_ "), whether granted under the Atmel
Corporation 2005 Stock Plan, the Newport Media, Inc. 2005 Stock Incentive Plan
and RSU Sub-Plan or the Ozmo, Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (together, the "
_Company Stock Plans_ "), that such Company Stock Option will, contingent on
the occurrence of the Effective Time, accelerate and become vested and
exercisable in full as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such
holder will have the right to exercise his or her Company Stock Option during
the Option Notice Period. To the extent not exercised prior by the conclusion
of the Option Notice Period, each Company Stock Option will be automatically
"net-exercised" immediately prior to the Effective Time, with the
exercise price and applicable withholding taxes paid by the withholding of
Shares otherwise issuable to such holder upon the exercise of the Company
Stock Option. Upon such exercise, the former holder of the Company Stock
Option will be issued the net number of shares resulting from the "net
exercise", and such stockholder will thereafter be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration in respect of these Shares as provided in _Article II_.

 

(b) _Company Units_. At the Effective Time, each then-outstanding and unvested
restricted stock unit, deferred stock unit, performance-based restricted
stock unit or similar right held by an individual who will continue in service
at the Effective Time, in each case representing a right to receive one Share,
whether or not granted under the Company Stock Plans (a " _Company Unit_ "),
including each "performance share award" denominated in Company Units, will be
assumed by Parent (such Company Unit, an " _Assumed Unit_ ") and converted
into the right to receive, if as and when the Assumed Unit would otherwise
have vested (taking into account, and without modification, any acceleration
of vesting under the applicable award agreement or other Contract with the
award holder), that number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the number of Shares subject to such
Assumed Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) $8.15 _divided by_
the Average Parent Closing Price (rounded down to the nearest whole share).
Any Company Unit that is vested at the Effective Time (taking into account any
acceleration of vesting under the applicable award agreement or other Contract
with the award holder), but as to which the underlying Share has not been
issued by the Effective Time, will be issued as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and will be treated as outstanding Company Common Stock for
purposes of _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_, and shall receive the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Article II_, subject to applicable tax
withholding.

(c) Notwithstanding the terms of _Section 5.15(a)_ or  _Section 5.15(b)_, to
the extent that Parent determines that the assumption and conversion of a
Company Unit as provided in _Section 5.15(b)_, would violate, in respect of
the holder thereof, the applicable Laws of a non-U.S. jurisdiction,

 



46  Parent may treat such Company Unit in a manner other than as prescribed by
_Section 5.15(b)_ so long as the holder of such Company Unit receives the
full value of the Merger Consideration (less applicable tax withholdings) in
cash not later than the vesting date originally applicable to the
corresponding Shares subject to such Company Unit (such Company Unit and the
Assumed Units, the " _Assumed Equity Awards_ "). Parent and the Company shall
agree at least 10 days prior to the Effective Time to the treatment of any
Company Unit that will be treated in a manner other than as prescribed by
_Section 5.15(b)_.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all actions reasonably
necessary to (i) terminate the Atmel Corporation 2010 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
(ii) provide that any "Offering Period" (as defined in the Company ESPP) in
progress on the Closing Date will be shortened in accordance with Section
19(c) of the Company ESPP, and the last day of each such Offering Period shall
be the 10th Business Day prior to the Closing Date (the " _Final Purchase
Date_ "), with purchases made on the Final Purchase Date contingent upon the
Closing, and (iii) avoid the commencement of any new Offering Period under the
Company ESPP at or after the Final Purchase Date and prior to the earlier of
the termination of this Agreement or the Effective Time. Any Shares acquired
under the Company ESPP prior to or on the Final Purchase Date will be treated
as outstanding Shares for purposes of _Section 2.1_ and _Section 2.2_.

 

(e) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later
than 10 Business Days following the Effective Time, Parent shall file a
registration statement under the Securities Act on Form S-8 or another
appropriate form (and use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
effectiveness thereof and maintain the current status of the prospectuses
contained therein) relating to shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with
respect to all Assumed Equity Awards, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause such registration statement to remain in effect for so long
as such Assumed Equity Awards remain outstanding. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall take all actions reasonably necessary so that Parent may
assume, grant and convert the Assumed Equity Awards at the Effective Time in
compliance with applicable Laws.

 

(f) Parent shall cause the assumption of the Assumed Equity Awards to occur in
a manner so as to remain exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code,
and this _Section 5.15_ shall be construed consistent with such intent. Each
payment with respect to an Assumed Equity Award as to which payments will be
made in installments is and will be treated as a separate payment for
purposes of Section 409A of the Code. As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company (and the Company Board and
any applicable committees thereof) and Parent (and the Parent Board and
any applicable committees thereof) will take all actions and adopt such
resolutions as may be required to give effect to and accomplish the
transactions contemplated by this _Section 5.15_.

 

5.16 _Company Stock Options and Company Unit Information_. The Company will
provide, within 10 days after the date hereof, as of the most recent
reasonably practicable date, a complete and correct list of each outstanding
Company Stock Option or Company Unit, including the employee identification
number of the grantee, the date of grant, the date of expiration, the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award as of such date, the
exercise price, the vesting schedule and the number of shares of Company
Common Stock vested and unvested as of such date.

 

5.17 _Stockholder Litigation_. The parties to this Agreement shall cooperate
and consult with one another in connection with any stockholder litigation
against any of them or any of their respective directors or officers with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of
and without in any way limiting the foregoing, each of the parties shall use
its respective reasonable best efforts to prevail in such litigation so as to
permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
the manner contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as reasonably
practicable.

 



47 5.18 _Financing_.

recently available audited consolidated financial statements of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and use reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such

comfort letters to the underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents,
as applicable, in connection with any such Financing; (ii) furnish Parent and

to the closing date for such Financing and unaudited statements of income and
cash flows for the period elapsed from the beginning of the applicable fiscal
year to the end of such fiscal quarter and, in each case, for the comparable
periods of the preceding fiscal year (with respect to which, in the case of
the Company, the independent auditors shall have performed an SAS 100, as
amended by PCOAB standards, review, although such independent auditors will
not be preparing, nor shall they be required to prepare, a written
report concerning such SAS 100 review); _provided_ that filing of the
required financial statements on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q by the Company will
satisfy the foregoing requirement; (iii) furnish such additional customary and
readily available financial statements, schedules or other financial data
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries as may be reasonably necessary

to the extent such Financing is scheduled to close concurrently with the

other reasonable actions that are or may be customary in connection with any
such Financing ( _provided_ that such agreements, certificates and other
documents entered into shall be conditioned upon, and shall not take effect
prior to, the Effective Time); (vii) provide Parent with such customary and
relevant information as is reasonably requested by Parent to allow Parent to
prepare any necessary pledge or security agreements, certificates or other
documents in connection with any such Financing and otherwise reasonably
facilitate the pledging of, and granting, recording and perfection of security
interests in share certificates, securities and other collateral,
and obtaining surveys and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent;
_provided_ that neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is required to
enter into any such agreement, certificate or document, pledge any collateral
or grant any lien or security interest or obtain a release of any existing
lien or security interest prior to the Effective Time; and (viii) provide to
the Financing Sources, at least five days prior to the closing date for such
Financing, all documentation and other information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries that are required by regulatory authorities under
the applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including without limitation the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and
requested by Parent or the Financing Sources at least 10 Business Days prior
to the closing date for such Financing.

 



48 (b) The Company shall (i) obtain customary payoff letters from third-party
lenders and trustees with respect to the Retired Company Indebtedness and
(ii) deliver or cause to be delivered such payoff letters to Parent at the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, subject to Parent making available
necessary funds to do so, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, permanently (A) terminate the credit facilities of the Company requested
by Parent to be so terminated, if and to the extent such facilities are

Indebtedness_ "), and (B) cause to be released any Liens on its assets
relating to such Retired Company Indebtedness.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 5.18_ or any other
provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Agreement will require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this
Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the
Effective Time for which it has not received prior reimbursement from Parent,
(ii) enter into any definitive agreement that is effective prior to the
Effective Time, (iii) give any indemnities that are effective prior to the
Effective Time, (iv) take any action that could unreasonably interfere with
the ongoing operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or create a risk of
damage or destruction to any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (v) provide any information or take any action that will
conflict with or violate its organizational documents or any applicable legal
requirement or would result in a violation or breach of, or default under, any
material Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
or would result in the waiver of a legal privilege. In addition, no action,
liability or obligation of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives pursuant to any certificate, agreement,
arrangement, document or instrument relating to any such Financing will be
effective until the Effective Time, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries will be required to take any action pursuant to any certificate,

_Section 5.18_ that is not contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or
that must be effective prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement
will require (A) any officer or Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to deliver any certificate or opinion or take any other action
pursuant to this  _Section 5.18_ or any other provision of this Agreement
that could reasonably be expected to result in personal liability to such
officer or Representative or (B) the members of the Company Board as of the
date hereof to approve any financing or Contracts related thereto prior to
the Effective Time.

(d) All non-public or other confidential information provided by the Company
or any of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement will be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure
Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Sub will be permitted to disclose
such information (i) as is legally required to be disclosed in any offering
documents related to any Financing or (ii) to any Financing Sources or
prospective Financing Sources, ratings agencies and other financial
institutions and investors that are or may become parties to any Financing
and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in connection
with any Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and
auditors) so long as such Persons (A) agree to be bound by the
Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement as if parties thereto and (B) are
subject to other confidentiality undertakings customary for financings of the
same type as such Financing.

 

(e) Parent (i) indemnifies, defends and holds harmless the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any loss,
damages, claim, cost, liability, obligation or expense suffered or incurred in
connection with any such Financing, any arrangement thereof and any
information provided in connection therewith except (A) historical
information relating thereto or other information furnished in writing by or

extent arising from the willful misconduct, gross negligence, fraud or
intentional

notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, their
obligations hereunder, including their obligations to consummate the Closing,
are not subject to, or conditioned on, receipt of any Financing.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Companys
breach of any of its covenants required to be performed by it under this
_Section 5.18_ will not be considered in determining the satisfaction of the

and directly results in Parent being unable to obtain the proceeds of the
Financing prior to or at the Closing.

 

5.19 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company to
perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and to consummate

advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of NASDAQ
to enable and facilitate the delisting of the Company Common Stock from the

notice of termination is delivered) are those set forth in _Section 6.1(b)_
(solely with respect to Antitrust Laws) or _Section 6.1(d)_ and such failure

performance, or other equitable relief if the Agreement is terminated and the
Company has paid the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section 7.5_
, (ii) the Company shall not be entitled to any such injunction or
injunctions, specific performance, or other equitable relief if the Agreement

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this _Section 8.9_ will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction.

8.10 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time
before or after the Company Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, after such approval, there is not to be made any amendment that by Law
requires further approval by the Company Stockholders, without further
approval of such Company Stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended
except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.
The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or

_Sections 7.5(i)_ , _7.5(j)_ , _7.5(k)_ , _8.6_ , _8.7_ and this _Section

consent of such Financing Source.

obligations to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party
and, together with the other provisions of this Agreement for the benefit of
such party, may be waived in writing by such party in whole or in part to
the extent permitted by applicable Laws.

validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of
this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance,
is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable provision will be
substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and
enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision
and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision
to other Persons or circumstances will not be affected by such invalidity or
unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or unenforceability affect the
validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in
any other jurisdiction.

8.13 _Obligations of Subsidiaries_. Whenever this Agreement requires
a Subsidiary of any party to take any action, such requirement will be deemed
to include an undertaking on the part of the party to cause such Subsidiary
(including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries) to take such action.
