unrelated bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to FSC (the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of FSC Common Stock, for
exchange in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ , through the Exchange Agent,
sufficient cash and ABCB Common Stock to make all deliveries of cash and ABCB
Common Stock as required by this _ARTICLE II_ , including the Merger
Consideration, pursuant to an exchange agent agreement between ABCB and the
Exchange Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the parties hereto (the "
_Exchange Agent Agreement_ "). ABCB agrees to make available to the Exchange
Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.8(c)_ and to make payments in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_. Any cash and ABCB
Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (including as payment for any
dividends or other distributions in accordance with _Section 2.8(c)_
and fractional shares in accordance with _Section 2.8(d)_ ) shall
hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Exchange Agent
shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, deliver the Merger
Consideration contemplated to be paid for shares of FSC Common Stock pursuant
to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by ABCB, _provided_ that no
such investment or losses thereon shall affect the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to the holders of shares of FSC Common Stock.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
to ABCB. Except as contemplated by this Agreement and the Exchange Agent
Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

  



  

(i) ABCB shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time (and in any event no later than three
(3) Business Days after the Effective Time), to each record holder, as of the
Effective Time, of an outstanding Certificate or Book-Entry Share that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of FSC Common Stock
(A) a letter of transmittal in customary form as directed by ABCB and
reasonably acceptable to FSC (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of FSC Common Stock shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the corresponding certificates (the "
_Certificates_ ") representing such shares to the Exchange Agent or receipt by
the Exchange Agent of an "agent's message" with respect to non-certificated
shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")), and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of
the shares of FSC Common Stock represented thereby (collectively, the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ").

  



  

(ii) Promptly after the Effective Time, upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent
together with, in each case, a properly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
the exchange instructions, the holders of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, the Merger
Consideration, including any cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares of
ABCB Common Stock pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_. No interest shall be paid or
accrued on any Merger Consideration. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of shares of FSC Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records
of FSC, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares of FSC
Common Stock may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate representing such
shares of FSC Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and the Person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the delivery of the
Merger Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are not payable.

  



  

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged FSC Common Stock_.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to ABCB
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to
the ABCB Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares of ABCB Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder
until such holder shall surrender such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in
accordance with this _Section 2.8_. Subject to Applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, there shall be paid to
such holder of ABCB Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor, without
interest, (i) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of ABCB Common Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.8(d)_ and the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such holder's whole shares of ABCB Common Stock, and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to such
surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such holder's whole shares of ABCB Common Stock.

  



    

 | 16| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip or ABCB Common
Stock representing fractional shares of ABCB Common Stock or book-entry
credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, no dividend or other distribution, stock
split or interest shall relate to any such fractional share and such
fractional share shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any
rights as a holder of any ABCB Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares of FSC Common Stock
exchanged in the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of ABCB Common Stock (after taking into account all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount, rounded to
the nearest whole cent, equal to the product of (i) the Average ABCB Closing
Stock Price and (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all
shares of FSC Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and
rounded to three decimal places) of ABCB Common Stock that such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.6_.

  



  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of FSC Common Stock after one
(1) year following the Effective Time shall be delivered to ABCB upon demand
and, from and after such delivery to ABCB, any former holders of FSC Common
Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE II_
shall thereafter look only to ABCB for the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of such shares of FSC Common Stock. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by holders of shares of FSC Common Stock immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
thereupon become the property of ABCB free and clear of any Liens, claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(f) _No Liability_. Neither ABCB nor any of ABCB's Subsidiaries
shall be liable to any holder of shares of FSC Common Stock for any shares of
ABCB Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official or Governmental
Authority in the reasonable belief that such delivery was required pursuant to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed in form and
substance acceptable to ABCB and, if required by ABCB, the posting by such
Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as ABCB may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of FSC Common Stock represented by such Certificate.

  



    

 | 17| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(h) _Withholding_. Each of ABCB and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of FSC Common Stock such amounts as
ABCB or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by ABCB or
the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of FSC Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by ABCB or
the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  



  

(i) _Book Entry_. All shares of ABCB Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger shall be issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates.

  



  

2.9 _Certain Adjustments_. If, after the date of this Agreement and
at or prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of ABCB
Common Stock or FSC Common Stock are changed into a different number of
shares or type of securities by reason of any stock split, stock combination,
stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or similar transaction with
respect to such stock, and the record date therefor shall be prior to the
Effective Time, then the Merger Consideration will be proportionately adjusted
as necessary to provide to the holders thereof the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such adjustment event.

  



  

2.10 _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in FSC Common
Stock_. At the Closing Date, the stock transfer books of FSC shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
shares of FSC Common Stock on the records of FSC, except for the cancellation
of such shares in connection with the Merger. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares that evidenced
ownership of shares of FSC Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares,
except as otherwise provided for herein or by Applicable Law. If, after the
Effective Time, bona fide Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE II_.

  



  

2.11 _Proxy and Registration Statement_.

  



  

(a) ABCB and FSC shall promptly prepare the Registration Statement
on Form S-4 or other applicable form, which ABCB shall file with the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement (and
in any event no later than sixty (60) days following the date of this
Agreement) and which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of ABCB
and FSC shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Registration
Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
reasonably practicable after such filing and to keep the Registration
Statement effective as long as necessary to consummate the Merger, the Bank
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and by the Bank Merger
Agreement. Each of FSC and ABCB will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to
be filed with the SEC and mailed to the FSC Shareholders and the ABCB
Shareholders, respectively, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. ABCB
shall also take any action required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the issuance and reservation of ABCB
Common Stock in the Merger, and FSC shall furnish all information concerning
FSC and the holders of FSC Common Stock, or holders of a beneficial interest
therein, as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

  



    

 | 18| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) ABCB will advise FSC promptly after it receives oral or written
notice of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order,
the suspension of the qualification of ABCB Common Stock issuable in
connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, the
initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, or any oral or
written request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or
the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide FSC
with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities
commission.

  



  

(c) If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information
relating to ABCB or FSC, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, is discovered by ABCB or FSC which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the FSC Shareholders and
the ABCB Shareholders.

  



  

2.12 _FSC Shareholder Approval_.

  



  

(a) FSC shall take all action necessary in accordance with
Applicable Laws, applicable rules of Nasdaq and FSC's current
Charter Documents to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
FSC Shareholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof in
accordance with this Agreement, the " _FSC Shareholders ' Meeting_"), to be
held as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared
effective under the Securities Act, for the purpose of obtaining the
FSC Shareholder Approval. The board of directors of FSC has resolved to
recommend to the FSC Shareholders that they approve this Agreement and except
to the extent FSC's board of directors has effected an Adverse Recommendation
Change in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, FSC shall, acting
through its board of directors, (i) recommend that the FSC Shareholders
approve this Agreement (the " _FSC Recommendation_ "), (ii) include the FSC
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and (iii) use reasonable
best efforts to solicit from the FSC Shareholders proxies in favor of the
approval of this Agreement, including by communicating to the FSC
Shareholders the recommendation of the board of directors of FSC that they
approve this Agreement and engaging a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable
to ABCB to assist in the solicitation of proxies from FSC Shareholders. FSC
may adjourn or postpone the FSC Shareholders' Meeting (x) to allow time for
the filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure
document that the board of directors of FSC has determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed
and disseminated under Applicable Law or (y) if as of the time that the FSC
Shareholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of FSC Common
Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the FSC Shareholders' Meeting, or if on
the date thereof FSC has not received proxies representing a sufficient number
of shares of FSC Common Stock necessary to obtain the FSC Shareholder
Approval. In the event of such an adjournment or postponement, FSC shall
continue to use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from the FSC
Shareholders in order to obtain the FSC Shareholder Approval, except to the
extent FSC's board of directors has effected an Adverse Recommendation Change
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and otherwise subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except with the prior approval of ABCB
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), no other
matters shall be submitted for the approval of the FSC Shareholders at the
FSC Shareholders' Meeting. FSC shall cooperate with ABCB and use its
reasonable best efforts to hold the FSC Shareholders' Meeting on the same
date and at the same time as the ABCB Shareholders' Meeting.

  



    

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Neither FSC's board of directors nor any committee thereof shall
(x) except as expressly permitted by this _Section 2.12(b)_ , withdraw,
qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to ABCB or any of ABCB's Subsidiaries, the FSC Recommendation
or (y) approve or recommend to the FSC Shareholders, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend to the FSC Shareholders, any Acquisition Proposal (each,
an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, FSC's board of directors may at any time
prior to the FSC Shareholders' Meeting (i) effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement
with respect to a Superior Proposal, if and only if:

  



  

(i) FSC's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent financial
advisor, that it has received an unsolicited, bona fide Acquisition Proposal
(that did not result from a breach of _Section 5.8_ ) that constitutes, or
is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and that has not been
withdrawn;

  



  

(ii) FSC's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with such outside legal counsel, that a failure to take such
actions would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties to FSC and its shareholders under Applicable Law;

  



  

(iii) FSC's board of directors provides written notice (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") to ABCB of its receipt of the Acquisition Proposal
and its intent to withdraw the FSC Recommendation on the fifth (5th) Business
Day following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal (it being understood that any amendment (and each successive
amendment) to any financial or other material term of such
Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Notice of Recommendation Change,
except that the five Business Day period referenced in clauses (iii), (iv)
and (v) of this _Section 2.12(b)_ shall be three (3) Business Days);

  



  

(iv) after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, FSC shall
negotiate in good faith with ABCB (if requested by ABCB) and provide ABCB
reasonable opportunity during the subsequent five (5)-Business Day (or three
(3)-Business Day) period(s) to make such changes in the terms and conditions
of this Agreement as would enable FSC's board of directors to proceed without
withdrawing the FSC Recommendation; _provided, however_, that ABCB shall not
be required to propose any such changes; and

  



    

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(v) FSC's board of directors, following the final such five
(5)-Business Day (or three (3)-Business Day) period, again determines in
good faith, after consultation with such outside legal counsel and such
independent financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal would continue
to constitute a Superior Proposal if such proposed revisions were to be given
effect.

  



  

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 2.12_ shall prohibit FSC or
the board of directors of FSC from complying with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under
the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal or from making any legally required disclosure to the
FSC Shareholders; _provided, however_ , that such Rules (other than a "stop,
look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) will in no way eliminate or modify
the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules would otherwise have under
this Agreement.

  



  

2.13 _ABCB Shareholder Approval_. ABCB shall take all action necessary
in accordance with Applicable Laws, applicable rules of Nasdaq and ABCB's
current Charter Documents to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting
of the ABCB Shareholders (including any adjournment or postponement thereof
in accordance with this Agreement, the " _ABCB Shareholders ' Meeting_"), to
be held as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is
declared effective under the Securities Act, for the purpose of obtaining the
ABCB Shareholder Approval. The board of directors of ABCB has resolved to
recommend to the ABCB Shareholders that they approve the ABCB Common Stock
Issuance and ABCB shall, acting through its board of directors, (i) recommend
that the ABCB Shareholders approve the ABCB Common Stock Issuance (the "
_ABCB Recommendation_ "), (ii) include the ABCB Recommendation in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to solicit from the
ABCB Shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the ABCB Common Stock
Issuance, including by communicating to the ABCB Shareholders the
recommendation of the board of directors of ABCB that they approve the ABCB
Common Stock Issuance and engaging a proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to
FSC to assist in the solicitation of proxies from ABCB shareholders. ABCB may
adjourn or postpone the ABCB Shareholders' Meeting (x) to allow time for the
filing and dissemination of any supplemental or amended disclosure document
that the board of directors of ABCB has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) is required to be filed
and disseminated under Applicable Law or (y) if as of the time that the ABCB
Shareholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus) there are insufficient shares of ABCB Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary
to conduct the business of the ABCB Shareholders' Meeting, or if on the date
thereof ABCB has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
shares of ABCB Common Stock necessary to obtain the ABCB
Shareholder Approval. In the event of such an adjournment or postponement,
ABCB shall continue to use reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from
the ABCB Shareholders in order to obtain the ABCB Shareholder Approval,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except with the prior
approval of FSC (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), no other matters shall be submitted for the approval of the ABCB
Shareholders at the ABCB Shareholders' Meeting. ABCB shall cooperate with FSC
and use its reasonable best efforts to hold the ABCB Shareholders' Meeting on
the same date and at the same time as the FSC Shareholders' Meeting.

authorization, execution and delivery by ABCB and Ameris, as applicable) the
legal, valid and binding obligations of FSC and Fidelity enforceable against

§1818(b), the appointment of a conservator or receiver, bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws
affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and general principles of

_Section 3.5_ hereof are duly obtained, (A) conflict with or violate in any
material respect any Applicable Law as to FSC or any of its Subsidiaries, (B)

Disclosure Schedule Section 3.4_ , or (C) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien other than Permitted Liens on any of the assets of FSC

Material Adverse Effect on FSC.

including financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto, complied with
Applicable Law. Neither FSC nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any
cease-and-desist or other formal or informal order or enforcement action
issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent agreement,
operating agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any
commitment letter, regulatory directive or similar undertaking with, or is
subject to any capital directive by, or since January 1, 2015 has been ordered
to pay any civil money penalty by, or has adopted any board resolutions at
the request of, any FSC Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority of
any kind that currently restricts in any material respect the conduct of its
business or that in any material manner relates to its capital adequacy, its
ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its
management or its business (each, an " _FSC Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has
FSC or any of its Subsidiaries been advised since January 1, 2015 by any FSC
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority that it is considering
issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any such FSC Regulatory
Agreement. Except for normal examinations conducted by a FSC Regulatory
Agency in the ordinary course of business of FSC and its Subsidiaries, to
FSC's Knowledge, there is no unresolved written violation, criticism, comment
or exception by any FSC Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority
relating to FSC or any of its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be expected
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on FSC. As of the date hereof, FSC is not aware of any reason attributable to
FSC or Fidelity why all required Regulatory Approvals would not be received on
a timely basis without undue delay.

3.7 _Capitalization_.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of FSC consists only of (i)
50,000,000 shares of FSC Common Stock, of which 27,298,456 shares (including
277,968 shares granted in respect of FSC Restricted Stock Awards) are issued
and outstanding as of December 14, 2018 (the " _FSC Capitalization Date_ "),
and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value per share, of
which no shares are issued and outstanding as of the FSC Capitalization Date.
Such issued and outstanding shares of FSC Common Stock constitute all of
the issued and outstanding capital stock of FSC as of the FSC Capitalization
Date, and have been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. None of the shares of FSC Common Stock have been issued or
disposed of in violation of any preemptive rights of any Person. As of the
date of this Agreement, 916,994 shares of FSC Common Stock were reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of outstanding FSC Stock Options and 1,224,332
shares of FSC Common Stock were available for future grants of equity awards
under the FSC Incentive Plans. Except as disclosed on _FSC Disclosure
Schedule Section 3.7(a)_ , as of the date of this Agreement, no trust
preferred or subordinated debt securities of FSC or any of its Subsidiaries
are issued or outstanding, and FSC currently has no election in effect to
defer interest payments with respect to any trust preferred securities or
related debentures issued by it or any of its Affiliates.

  



  

(b) _FSC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.7(b)_ sets forth the
following for each grant or award of FSC Stock Options, FSC Restricted
Stock Awards or other outstanding rights, plans, options, warrants, calls,
conversion rights or other arrangements or commitments that obligate FSC or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue or dispose of any of its capital stock or
other ownership interests (in each case, to the extent applicable): (i) the
name of the grantee; (ii) the date of the grant; (iii) the expiration date;
(iv) the vesting schedule; (v) the exercise price; (vi) the number of shares
of FSC Common Stock, or any other security of FSC or any of its
Subsidiaries, subject to such award; and (vii) the number of shares subject
to such award that are exercisable as of the date of this Agreement. Except
as set forth on _FSC Disclosure Schedule Section 3.7(b)_ , all shares of FSC
Common Stock and FSC Restricted Stock Awards issuable upon exercise of FSC
Stock Options, upon their issuance on the terms and conditions specified in
the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights
and will not be issued in violation of preemptive rights or any Law. Each
grant of FSC Stock Options was appropriately authorized by the board of
directors of FSC or the compensation committee thereof, was made in accordance
with the terms of the applicable FSC Incentive Plan and any Applicable Law
and has a grant date identical to (or later than) the date on which it was
actually granted or awarded. The per share exercise price of each FSC Stock
Option was determined in accordance with the applicable FSC Incentive Plan
and was not less than the fair market value of a share of FSC Common Stock on
the applicable date on which the related grant was by its terms to be
effective.

any securities exchangeable for or convertible into the capital stock of FSC
or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) contractual obligations of FSC or any of its

FSC Common Stock or capital stock of its Subsidiaries (other than the FSC
Voting Agreement). No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having
the right to vote on any matters on which the holders of capital stock may
vote have been issued by FSC or any of its Subsidiaries and are outstanding

3.8 _Deposits_. The deposit accounts of Fidelity are insured by the
FDIC to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, and all premiums

thereto, complied in all material respects with the requirements of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not,
at the time it was filed (or became effective in the case of registration
statements), or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date of the most recent
amendment or supplement thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

3.10 _Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) The financial statements of FSC and its Subsidiaries included

its Subsidiaries, (ii) fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated results of operations, cash flows, changes in shareholders'

their respective dates of filing with the SEC, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and (iv) have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods
involved, except, in each case, as indicated in such statements or in the
notes thereto. As of the date hereof, the books and records of FSC and its

GAAP and any other applicable legal and accounting requirements and reflect
only actual transactions. As of the date hereof, Ernst and Young LLP has not
resigned (or informed FSC that it intends to resign) or been dismissed as
independent public accountants of FSC as a result of or in connection with
any disagreements with FSC on a matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure.

  



  

(b) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on FSC, neither FSC nor any of
its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability or obligation of any nature
whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether
due or to become due) required by GAAP to be included in the consolidated
balance sheet of FSC, except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or
reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of FSC included in its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended the Interim
Balance Sheet Date (including any notes thereto), (ii) liabilities or
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the end of such fiscal quarter or (iii) liabilities or

computerized or not) that are under the exclusive ownership and direct
control of FSC or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access thereto and therefrom) except as would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on FSC. FSC
(i) has implemented and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) to ensure that material
information relating to FSC, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the
chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of FSC by others
within those entities as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures and to make the certifications required by the Exchange
Act and Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) has disclosed,
based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to FSC's
outside auditors and the audit committee of FSC's board of directors (A) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect FSC's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and
(B) to FSC's Knowledge, any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in FSC's internal
controls over financial reporting. To FSC's Knowledge, there is no reason to
believe that FSC's outside auditors and its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next
due.

with all requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as presently conducted and (iv)
duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its activities or the
character of the properties it owns or leases make such qualification
necessary, except in the case of (iii) or (iv) where the lack of
such corporate power, authority, authorization or qualification has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
ABCB. True, complete and correct copies of the Charter Documents of ABCB, as

by FSC and Fidelity, as applicable) the legal, valid and binding
obligations of ABCB and Ameris enforceable against ABCB and Ameris, as
applicable, in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may
be limited by Applicable Laws related to safety and soundness of insured
depository institutions as set forth in 12 U.S.C. §1818(b), the appointment
of a conservator or receiver, bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium or similar Laws affecting creditors' rights and

with, the requirements of any provisions of their respective Charter
Documents concerning "business combination," "fair price," "voting

4.4 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by ABCB and of the Bank Merger Agreement by Ameris, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by ABCB and
its Subsidiaries, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, do not and will
not (i) conflict with, or result in a breach or violation of or default under,
any terms or conditions of the Charter Documents of ABCB or any of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) assuming that the consents and approvals referred to in
_Section 4.5_ hereof are duly obtained, (A) conflict with or violate in any
material respect any Applicable Law as to ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries,

cancellation pursuant to any ABCB Contract or (C) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien other than Permitted Liens on any of the assets of
ABCB or its Subsidiaries except, in the case of (B) and (C), as would not
reasonably be expected to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on ABCB.

  



  

4.5 _Consents and Approvals_. Other than the Regulatory Approvals
and the ABCB Shareholder Approval, no consents, approvals, authorizations or
other actions by, or filings with or notifications to, any Person or any
Governmental Authority on the part of ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries are
required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by ABCB or by Ameris of the Bank Merger Agreement, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

  



  

4.6 _Regulatory Matters_. Except as would not reasonably be expected
to have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse

reports, registrations and statements, together with any amendments required
to be made with respect thereto, that it was required to file since January 1,
2016 with, as applicable, (i) the Federal Reserve Board, (ii) the FDIC, (iii)
the GDBF and (iv) any other applicable bank regulatory agencies (collectively,
the " _ABCB Regulatory Agencies_ " and, together with the FSC Regulatory

Governmental Authority, and have paid all applicable fees, premiums and
assessments due and payable thereto, and each such report, registration and
statement, including financial statements, exhibits and schedules thereto,

board resolutions at the request of, any ABCB Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Authority of any kind that currently restricts in any material
respect the conduct of its business or that in any material manner relates to
its capital adequacy, its ability to pay dividends, its credit or risk
management policies, its management or its business (each, a " _ABCB
Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has ABCB or any of its Subsidiaries been
advised since January 1, 2015 by any ABCB Regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Authority that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering
or requesting any such ABCB Regulatory Agreement. Except for normal
examinations conducted by an ABCB Regulatory Agency in the ordinary course of
business of ABCB and its Subsidiaries, to ABCB's Knowledge, there is no
unresolved written violation, criticism, comment or exception by any ABCB
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Authority relating to ABCB or any of
its Subsidiaries, which would reasonably be expected to have, either
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on ABCB. As of
the date hereof, ABCB is not aware of any reason attributable to ABCB or
Ameris why all required Regulatory Approvals would not be received on a
timely basis without undue delay.

any capital stock of ABCB or its Subsidiaries, or any securities exchangeable
for or convertible into the capital stock of ABCB or its Subsidiaries, (ii)

information relating to ABCB, including its Subsidiaries, is made known to the

ABCB's outside auditors and the audit committee of ABCB's board of directors

13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect
ABCB's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information
and (B) to ABCB's Knowledge, any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in ABCB's

reason to believe that ABCB's outside auditors and its chief
executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to give the
certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without
qualification, when next due.

disclosure would contravene any Applicable Law or Order or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement or (y) relating to the
Providing Party's or its directors', officers', employees', accountants',

the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a
violation of this _Section 5.5_ or a failure of any condition set forth in

5.7 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

discretion, shall continue employment with the Surviving Corporation or any

following the Closing Date (each, a " _Discontinued Employee_ ") shall be
provided by ABCB or its Subsidiaries with severance benefits under the
existing severance policies of ABCB and its Subsidiaries; _provided,
however_ , that any such Discontinued Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with FSC or its Subsidiaries (prior to the Effective

purposes under such severance policies; and _provided, further_, that such
benefit payments shall be conditioned on execution of a customary release of

(c) With respect to any ABCB Employee Benefit Plan in which any
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate on or after the
Closing Date, ABCB shall (i) waive all preexisting conditions, actively at
work requirements, exclusion and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements under any such ABCB Employee Benefit
Plan to the extent they were inapplicable to, or were satisfied under, any
FSC Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated prior
to the Closing Date and (ii) ensure that each Continuing Employee receives
full credit (including eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation
entitlement and severance benefits, but excluding benefit accrual under any
defined benefit ABCB Employee Benefit Plan or any such credit that would
result in a duplication of benefits) under each ABCB Employee Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employee becomes or may become a participant for
service with the Surviving Corporation (or any predecessor to the Surviving
Corporation and its Affiliates), to the same extent such service was credited
under the FSC Employee Benefit Plans. As of the Closing Date, ABCB shall, and
shall cause its applicable Subsidiaries to, credit Continuing Employees the
amount of vacation time that such employees had accrued under any vacation
policy or arrangement as of the Closing Date. With respect to each ABCB
Employee Benefit Plan that is a health plan in which Continuing Employees
participate after Closing, ABCB shall (A) cause to be waived any eligibility
waiting period, any evidence of insurability requirement and the application
of any pre-existing condition limitation under such plan to the extent such
requirements or limitations were inapplicable to, or were satisfied under, any
FSC Employee Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
prior to the Closing Date and (B) cause each Continuing Employee to be given
credit with respect to the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs (or, if
later, the plan year in which such Continuing Employee becomes eligible to
participate in such ABCB Employee Benefit Plan) (the " _Transition Plan Year_
") for amounts (such as deductibles and co-payments) paid under any similar
FSC Employee Benefit Plan by such Continuing Employee, with respect to the
Transition Plan Year, as though such amounts had been paid in accordance with
the terms and conditions of any applicable ABCB Employee Benefit Plan.

  



  

(d) ABCB and FSC acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained
in this _Section 5.7_ are included for the sole benefit of ABCB and FSC and
nothing contained herein shall (i) be construed as an amendment to any FSC
Employee Benefit Plan or ABCB Employee Benefit Plan or the creation of any
new employee benefit plan, (ii) create any third-party beneficiary or other
rights in any other Person, including any employee or former employee of any
of ABCB or FSC or their respective Subsidiaries, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (iii) otherwise obligate ABCB or any of its
Affiliates to maintain any particular FSC Employee Benefit Plan, ABCB
Employee Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or retain the employment
of any particular employee following the Closing Date.

  



  

(e) If requested in writing delivered by ABCB as of no later than
ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, FSC shall terminate any
401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by FSC (each, an " _FSC 401(k) Plan_ "),
effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, by resolution adopted by
the board of directors of FSC, in a form reasonably acceptable to ABCB (whose
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In such event, ABCB
shall permit each participant in the FSC 401(k) Plan prior to the Closing
Date to immediately participate in a 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by
ABCB or one of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _ABCB 401(k) Plan_ ") and roll
over his or her account balance (including any outstanding loans and any
shares of ABCB Common Stock issued in respect of shares of FSC Common Stock

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, or, if earlier, the
date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _ARTICLE VII_
, except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.8_, FSC shall not, and
shall cause all of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action
to solicit, initiate, seek, knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries
or expressions of interest or the making of any proposal or offer that
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any

and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease any discussions,
negotiations or communications with any Persons with respect to any

(b) Notwithstanding _Section 5.8(a)_ or any other provision of this
Agreement, FSC may, provided that it shall comply with the requirements of
_Section 2.12(b)_ , take any of the actions described in _Section 5.8(a)_
with respect to an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
received by FSC prior to the FSC Shareholders' Meeting, which Acquisition
Proposal did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.8_ , if, but only
if, (i) FSC's board of directors determines in good faith (in accordance with
this Agreement and after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
independent financial advisor) that (A) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (B)
a failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties to FSC and its shareholders under Applicable
Law, (ii) FSC provides ABCB with prompt (and in any event within twenty-four
(24) hours) notice of such determination and (iii) prior to furnishing
or affording access to any information or data with respect to FSC or any of
its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to such Acquisition Proposal, FSC
receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no less
favorable to FSC than those contained in the Nondisclosure Agreement. FSC
shall promptly provide to ABCB any non-public information regarding FSC or its
Subsidiaries provided to any other Person that was not previously provided to
ABCB, such additional information to be provided no later than the date of
provision of such information to such other party.

  



  

(c) FSC shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) notify ABCB in writing if any proposals or offers (or modified offers
or proposals) are received by, any information is requested from, or any
negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, FSC
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, in each
case constituting or in connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such
notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating such discussions or
negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information request and the
material terms and conditions of any such proposals, offers or
information requests.

  



  

5.9 _Indemnification; Directors ' and Officers' Insurance_.

  



  

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
ABCB shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the
Effective Time is, or any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director,
officer or employee of FSC or any of its Subsidiaries and each individual who
served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise if such service was at the request or for the
benefit of FSC or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnitees_ ") in respect
of all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in connection with
any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation (each a " _Claim_ "),
whenever asserted, based on or arising out the fact that the Indemnitee
was an officer, director or employee of FSC or any Subsidiary (or fiduciary
of any benefit plan of FSC or its Subsidiaries) for acts or omissions by the
Indemnitee in such capacity or taken at the request of FSC or any Subsidiary,
at or any time prior to the Effective Time (including any Claim relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Bank Merger Agreement),
to the fullest extent permitted by Law and (ii) assume all obligations of FSC
and its Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time as provided in FSC's Charter Documents and the
organizational documents of FSC's Subsidiaries. In addition, ABCB, from and
after the Effective Time, shall advance any expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) of any Indemnitee under this _Section 5.9(a)_ as incurred
to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, _provided_ that the
Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
advances if it shall be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified pursuant to this _Section 5.9(a)_. In the event of any such
Claim, ABCB shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitee, and the Indemnitee
shall reasonably cooperate with ABCB, in the defense of any such Claim.

   



    

 | 61| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) ABCB shall maintain in effect for six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies maintained by FSC ( _provided_ that ABCB may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions which are no less advantageous to such officers and directors so
long as substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided,
however_, that in no event shall ABCB be required to expend annually in the
aggregate an amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the annual
premium payment on FSC's current policy in effect as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Premium Cap_ ") and, in the event the cost of such coverage
shall exceed that amount, ABCB shall purchase as much coverage as possible for
such amount. In lieu of the foregoing, ABCB may obtain at or prior to the
Effective Time a prepaid "tail" policy providing coverage equivalent to that
described in the preceding sentence for an aggregate price of no more than the
Premium Cap.

  



  

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.9_ are intended for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs
and his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any Indemnitee
may have under FSC Charter Documents, by contract or otherwise. In the event
ABCB or any of its successors or assigns: (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all
or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of ABCB or the purchaser of its assets and properties shall assume
the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.9_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.9_
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this  _Section 5.9_, and this
_Section 5.9_ shall survive the Effective Time.

5.10 _Efforts to Consummate_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of FSC and ABCB agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Laws, so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby as promptly as practicable, including the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ hereof, and shall cooperate fully with
the other party hereto to that end.

  



  

5.11 _Data Conversion_. From and after the date hereof, ABCB and FSC
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the integration
of FSC with the business of ABCB following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for
the conversion of the data processing and related electronic information
technology system (the " _Data Conversion_ ") to those used by ABCB. ABCB and
FSC agree to use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly commence
preparations for implementation of the Data Conversion, with the goal of
effecting the Data Conversion after the Effective Time and at such later time
as mutually agreed upon by the parties. ABCB and FSC agree to cooperate in
preparing for the Data Conversion, including by providing reasonable access
to data, information systems and personnel having expertise with their and
their respective Subsidiaries' information and data systems; _provided,
however_ , that neither party shall be required to terminate any third-party
service provider arrangements prior to the Effective Time or take any other
action that would prejudice or adversely affect in any material respect its
rights under any such arrangements or contracts in the event the Closing does
not occur. ABCB shall promptly reimburse FSC on request for reasonable out-of-
pocket fees, expenses or charges that FSC may incur as a result of taking, at
the request of ABCB, any action prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the
Data Conversion.

  



  

5.12 _No Control of Other Party 's Business_. Nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give ABCB, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of FSC or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give FSC, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of ABCB or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective Time, each
of FSC and ABCB shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries'
respective operations.

  



  

5.13 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, and this Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g)
and for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. After the date of
this Agreement (including after the Effective Time) subject to the other
terms and conditions in this Agreement, each party hereto shall take any
action that is required to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take any
actions or cause any actions to be taken which would reasonably be likely to
prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a "reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the Code. All parties hereto shall report the Merger as
a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, unless
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code.

Time, in connection with each firm's delivery of its tax opinion pursuant to
_Section 6.2(d)_ and _Section 6.3(d)_. Each of ABCB and FSC shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such opinions to be delivered and not
to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or
fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be
untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the
certificates described in this _Section 5.13(b)_.

  



  

5.14 _Nasdaq Listing_. ABCB shall cause the shares of ABCB Common
Stock to be issued in the Merger as Merger Consideration to be approved for

(a) ABCB shall promptly notify FSC in writing of any Proceeding, or
of any claim, controversy or contingent liability that might reasonably be
expected to become the subject of a Proceeding, against ABCB or its
Subsidiaries, if such Proceeding or potential Proceeding is reasonably likely
to result in a Material Adverse Change in ABCB. ABCB shall promptly notify FSC
in writing of any Proceeding, pending or, to ABCB's Knowledge, threatened
against ABCB or its Subsidiaries, that (i) questions or would reasonably be
expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank Merger
Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or any
actions taken or to be taken by ABCB or Ameris with respect hereto or thereto
or (ii) seeks to enjoin or otherwise restrain the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

  



  

(b) FSC shall promptly notify ABCB in writing of any Proceeding, or
of any claim, controversy or contingent liability that might reasonably be
expected to become the subject of a Proceeding, against FSC or any of its
Subsidiaries, if such Proceeding or potential Proceeding is reasonably likely
to result in a Material Adverse Change in FSC. FSC shall promptly notify ABCB
in writing of any Proceeding, pending or, to FSC's Knowledge, threatened
against FSC or any of its Subsidiaries, that (i) questions or would
reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement, the Bank
Merger Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby or thereby or
any actions taken or to be taken by FSC or its Subsidiaries with respect

opportunity to participate at its own expense in the defense or settlement of
any shareholder litigation against FSC or its directors or Affiliates relating

shall be agreed to without ABCB's prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

  



  

5.16 _Trust Preferred Securities_. Upon the Effective Time, ABCB, or a
Subsidiary of ABCB, shall assume the performance and observance of the
covenants and conditions to be performed by FSC relating to the trust

III (collectively, the " _Trust Preferred Securities_ "), including the
execution and delivery of any supplemental indentures, guarantees and other
instruments required to make such assumptions effective.

  



    

 | 64|

5.17 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. FSC and ABCB
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those
officers and directors of FSC subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _FSC Insiders_ "), both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that the FSC Insiders not be subject
to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law in connection with the conversion of shares
of FSC Common Stock, FSC Stock Options and FSC Restricted Stock Awards in the
Merger, and for that compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the
provisions of this _Section 5.17_. The board of directors of ABCB and of FSC,
or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term is defined for
purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably promptly,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as may be
required to cause (in the case of FSC) any dispositions of FSC Common Stock,
FSC Stock Options or FSC Restricted Stock Awards by the FSC Insiders, and (in
the case of ABCB) any acquisitions of ABCB Common Stock by any FSC Insiders
who, immediately following the Merger, will be officers or directors of the
Surviving Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a)
of the Exchange Act, in each case pursuant to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under
the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law.

  



  

5.18 _Takeover Statutes_. None of FSC, ABCB or their respective boards
of directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to
become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger, or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to
exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and the
members of their respective boards of directors will grant such approvals and
take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

prior to the Closing Date:

  



  

(a) by the mutual written consent of FSC and ABCB;

  



  

(b) by either FSC, on the one hand, or ABCB, on the other, if the

_provided, however_, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this

terminating party of such breach, and which breach or breaches, either
individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party of any

exchange offer that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal and has been publicly
disclosed, failing to recommend rejection of such offer within the ten (10)

to the other party hereto, and upon such notice this Agreement shall
terminate. Except as provided under this _Section 7.2_ or otherwise
expressly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, upon termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , this Agreement shall forthwith
become void and of no further force and effect, there shall be no liability
on the part of any party hereto to the other party, and all rights and
obligations of any party hereto shall cease and the parties shall be released
from any and all obligations hereunder; _provided, however_, that (i) the
provisions of _Section 5.4(d)_ , this _Section 7.2_  and _ARTICLE VIII_
shall survive any such termination and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
party from liability for damages resulting from fraud or the Willful Breach
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1(f)_ or _Section 7.1(g)_
, then FSC shall, within three (3) Business Days of such termination, pay to
ABCB the sum of $29,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in
the event that (i) a bona fide Acquisition Proposal with respect to FSC shall
have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the senior management or
board of directors of FSC or to the FSC Shareholders generally, or any Person
or group of Persons shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not
conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to FSC after the
date of this Agreement, and shall not have been publicly withdrawn, (ii)
thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by ABCB or FSC pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)_ (if the FSC Shareholder Approval has not theretofore been
obtained and all other conditions set forth in _Sections 6.1_ and _6.3_ had
been satisfied or waived or were capable of being satisfied prior to such
termination) or (B) by ABCB pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)_ and (iii) prior to
the date that is twelve (12) months after the date of such termination FSC
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or enters
into an Acquisition Agreement, then FSC shall, on the earlier of the date such
transaction is consummated or any such Acquisition Agreement is entered into,
pay to ABCB the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds; _provided _ that for purposes of this _Section 7.2(c)_ , the
references to twenty-five percent (25%) in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to fifty percent (50%).

  



  

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements, they would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if FSC fails to pay timely any Termination Fee
payable by it pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ , then FSC shall pay to ABCB its
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) in
connection with collecting such Termination Fee, together with interest on
the amount of the fee at the prime annual rate of interest (as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ ) plus two percent (2%) as the same is in effect
from time to time from the date such payment was due under this Agreement
until the date of payment.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
other than in connection with fraud or a Willful Breach of this Agreement, the
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ shall fully
discharge FSC from, and be the sole and exclusive remedy of ABCB with respect
to, any and all losses that may be suffered by ABCB based upon, resulting from
or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to the termination of this
Agreement. In no event shall FSC be required to pay the Termination Fee on
more than one occasion.

8.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance

of conflicts of laws; _provided_ that matters relating to the fiduciary
duties of the board of directors of FSC shall be subject to the Laws of the

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in

any state court located in the State of Delaware) (and any courts from which
appeals may be taken) (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in connection
with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the

jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying
venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any

jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such
party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given
in accordance with _Section 8.2_.

  



    

 | 72|

TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BANK MERGER AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH SUCH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
EACH SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) EACH SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 8.8_.

  



  

8.9 _Cumulative Remedies; Specific Performance_. All rights and
remedies under this Agreement or otherwise afforded by Applicable Law to
any party, shall be cumulative and not alternative. Without limiting the
rights of a party hereto to pursue all other legal and equitable rights
available to such party for another party's failure to perform its obligations
under this Agreement in accordance with its specific terms, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any failure to perform
their respective obligations hereunder would be inadequate and irreparable
damage would occur and that each party shall be entitled to
specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies in the
event of any such failure. Each of the parties hereby further waives any
requirement under Applicable Law to post security as a prerequisite to
obtaining equitable relief.

instrument.

  



  

8.12 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not
affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction,
and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such
jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 _FORM OF VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT_

  



  

THIS VOTING AND SUPPORT AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of
December 17, 2018, is entered into by and among Ameris Bancorp, a Georgia
corporation (" _ABCB_ "), Fidelity Southern Corporation, a Georgia corporation
(" _FSC_ "), and each person or entity executing this Agreement or a
counterpart to this Agreement as a shareholder of FSC (each, a " _Shareholder_
").

  



  

WITNESSETH:

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (as the
same may be amended or supplemented, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of
the date hereof and to be executed by ABCB and FSC concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement by the parties hereto, FSC will, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth therein, merge with and into ABCB, with ABCB
being the surviving entity (the " _Merger_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, as an inducement for ABCB to enter into the Merger Agreement, ABCB
has required that each Shareholder enter into this Agreement;

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to, the
parties entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the
transactions contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses
incurred and to be incurred by them in connection therewith, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

2. _Effectiveness_. The effectiveness of this Agreement shall be conditioned upon the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement by the parties thereto. If the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason in accordance with its terms, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and be null and void and of no effect.

  



  

3. _Voting Agreement_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the earliest to occur of (x) the
Effective Time, (y) the termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms and (z) the entry without the prior written consent
of such Shareholder into any amendment or modification of the Merger
Agreement which results in a decrease in, or change in the composition of, the
Merger Consideration (the " _Support Period_ "), each Shareholder irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that at any shareholder meeting of FSC to approve
the Merger Agreement or any adjournment or postponement thereof, such
Shareholder shall be present (in person or by proxy) and shall vote (or cause
to be voted) all shares of FSC Common Stock beneficially owned by such
Shareholder as of the date hereof, together with all shares of FSC Common
Stock over which such Shareholder may acquire beneficial ownership from time
to time after the date hereof, in each case that are entitled to vote at such
meeting (collectively, the " _Owned Shares_ "), as follows:

  



    



 



    



  

(i) in favor of (A) the approval or adoption of the Merger Agreement
and the transactions contemplated thereby (including any amendments or
modifications of the terms thereof approved by the board of directors of FSC
and adopted in accordance with the terms thereof) and (B) the approval of any
proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting to a later date if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement and such adjournment or
postponement is in accordance with the Merger Agreement; and

  



  

(ii) against (A) any action or agreement that would prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (B) other than the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, any proposal that relates to an
Acquisition Proposal, without regard to the terms of such proposal.

  



  

(b) Each Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any
written consent to rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or
written consent, as a shareholder of FSC, to approve or adopt the Merger
Agreement unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with
its terms.

  



  

(c) Each Shareholder represents and warrants and covenants and
agrees that, except for this Agreement, such Shareholder (i) has not
entered into, and shall not enter into during the Support Period, any voting
agreement or voting trust with respect to the Owned Shares and (ii) has not
granted, and shall not grant during the Support Period, a proxy, consent or
power of attorney with respect to the Owned Shares except any proxy to carry
out the intent of this Agreement.

  



  

4.   _Grant of Irrevocable Proxy; Appointment of Proxy_. During the Support Period, each Shareholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally grants to, and appoints, ABCB and any designee thereof as such Shareholder's proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of substitution), for and in the name, place and stead of such Shareholder, to vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy or written consent, if applicable) the Owned Shares owned by such Shareholder as of the applicable record date in accordance with _Section 3_ of this Agreement, and each Shareholder shall retain the authority to vote on all other matters; _provided, however_ , that each Shareholder's grant of the proxy contemplated by this _Section 4_ shall be effective if, and only if, such Shareholder has not delivered to FSC prior to the meeting at which any of the matters described in _Section 3_ are to be considered, a duly executed irrevocable proxy card directing that the Owned Shares of such Shareholder be voted in accordance with _Section 3_ of this Agreement. Each Shareholder hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set forth in this _Section 4_ , if it becomes effective, is coupled with an interest and is given in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance of the duties of such Shareholder under this Agreement. The parties hereby further affirm that the irrevocable proxy, if it becomes effective, is intended to be irrevocable until the end of the Support Period, at which time it will terminate automatically. If for any reason any proxy granted herein is not irrevocable after it becomes effective, then the Shareholder granting such proxy agrees, until the end of the Support Period, to vote the Owned Shares in accordance with _Section 3_ of this Agreement. The parties agree that the foregoing is a voting agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, this proxy shall automatically terminate and be revoked upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

obligation or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which such
Shareholder is a party or by which such Shareholder is bound, or any statute,
rule or regulation to which such Shareholder is subject or, in the event that

constitutes (or will constitute) a valid and legally binding agreement of,
such Shareholder's spouse, enforceable in accordance with its terms;

  



  

(e) the Owned Shares as of the date hereof are equal to the number

and

  



  

(f) except as noted on _Exhibit A_ hereto, such Shareholder has, and
at all times during the term of this Agreement shall have,
beneficial ownership of, good and valid title to and full and exclusive power
to vote, without restriction or limitation, the Owned Shares (other than any
such shares that are Transferred in the manner permitted by this Agreement).

  



  

8.   _Waiver of Certain Rights_. Each Shareholder agrees not to commence or participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or otherwise, against ABCB, FSC or any of their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates or successors relating to the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

9.   _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement is irrevocable. The exhibits hereto are incorporated as a part of this Agreement. This Agreement (and, to the extent referenced herein, the Merger Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise and shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto; _provided, however_ , that the rights under this Agreement are assignable by ABCB or FSC to any successor-in-interest.

10. _Remedies/Specific Enforcement_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its terms and that each of ABCB and FSC would be irreparably harmed if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any Shareholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which ABCB or FSC may be entitled (including monetary damages), each of ABCB and FSC shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof. Each Shareholder further agrees that none of ABCB, FSC or any other Person shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 10_ , and each Shareholder irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument. If any legal action or other proceeding is brought against any party hereto to enforce any provision of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover all reasonable expenses relating thereto (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, court costs and expenses incident to arbitration, appellate and post-judgment proceedings) from the party against which such action or proceeding is brought, in addition to any other relief to which such prevailing party may be entitled.

  



  

11. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_.

with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts made and
performed entirely within such state, without giving effect to its principles
of conflicts of Laws.

  



  

(b) Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in
respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery determines that it lacks
subject matter jurisdiction, any federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware and, if both the Court of Chancery and the federal courts sitting in
the State of Delaware determine that they lack subject matter jurisdiction,
any state court located in the State of Delaware) (and any courts from which
appeals may be taken) (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in connection
with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the
subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying
venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any
objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have
jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such
party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given
in accordance with _Section 8.2_ of the Merger Agreement, at the address of
ABCB or FSC, as the case may be, as set forth therein or, with respect to a
Shareholder, at the address set forth below such Shareholder's name on the

12. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

14. _Amendments; Waivers_.

No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
