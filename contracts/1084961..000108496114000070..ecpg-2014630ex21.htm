ARTICLE 3

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS 
WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES

As a material inducement to Encore to enter into this Agreement and to

and warrants to Encore that the statements contained in this Article 3 are
correct and complete as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing
except as set forth in the disclosure schedule of the Sellers attached hereto
(the "Disclosure Schedule"), which will be arranged to correspond to the
numbered and lettered sections and subsection contained in this Article 3. The
Parties recognize that the representations and warranties in this Article 3
which use the terms "enforceable," "realization" or words of similar meaning
in the context of the Acquiring Companies' rights and remedies against a third
party are limited by (a) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, and other Laws of general application affecting or relating to the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and (b) Laws relating to the
availability of specific performance and/or other equitable remedies.

correct and complete list of (a) the name of each Acquired Company, (b) the

Acquired Company. Each Acquired Company is duly organized, validly existing

copies of the Charter Documents of each Acquired Company. No Acquired Company

3.2 Qualification; Due Execution; Power and Authority.

(a) Each Acquired Company is in good standing (tax and otherwise) in each
other jurisdiction in which it is qualified to do business, and the
jurisdictions listed in Section 3.2 of the Disclosure Schedule constitute the
only jurisdictions in which the nature of such Acquired Company's business or
the ownership or leasing of its properties requires such qualification, except
for any failure to be so qualified or in good standing that, individually or
in the aggregate, has not been and would not reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole.

(b) Each Acquired Company has full legal right and all requisite power and
authority to execute and deliver each of the Transaction Documents to which it
is a party and to perform the transactions contemplated thereby. The execution
and delivery by each Acquired Company of each of the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby have been duly and validly 

authorized by all necessary action on the part of such Acquired Company. This
Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against
it in accordance with its terms. Each of the other Transaction Documents has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by the applicable Acquired
Company or, when so executed and delivered, will be duly and validly executed
and delivered by such Acquired Company, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms.

(c) Each Acquired Company has all corporate or comparable power and authority
necessary to carry on the businesses in which it is engaged and to own and use
the properties owned and used by it.

3.3 Company Records / Authority. To the extent such records exist, books
containing the records of meetings of the directors, members or board of
managers, as the case may be, of each Acquired Company and the stock, unit or
membership interest ledger and transfer books of each Acquired Company, all of
which have been previously provided to Encore, are correct and complete in all
material respects and accurately reflect the record holders of all outstanding
stock, units, membership interests and other equity securities issued by such
Acquired Company. All material actions taken by each Acquired Company since
the date of its formation have been duly authorized to the extent so required
by Laws and the charter documents of such Acquired Company.

3.4 Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance of the
Transaction Documents by the Acquired Companies, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated thereby, do not and will not, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both: (i) conflict with or result in a breach or
violation of the Charter Documents or any resolution of the directors,
managers, stockholders or members (or comparable Persons) of any Acquired
Company; (ii) require any consent, waiver, approval, declaration or
authorization of, or notice to or filing with, any Governmental Authority;
(iii) materially conflict with, result in a material default, material
modification or termination under, give any Person a right of termination,
cancellation, acceleration, suspension or revocation under, result in the loss
of a material benefit or the imposition of any material obligation under, or
require any material consent, waiver, approval, notice, filing, declaration or
authorization under, any Company Contract or Business Permit; (iv) result in
the creation or imposition of any Security Interest on the Shares or any
material Security Interest on the Business or any property or asset of the
Acquired Companies; (v) violate in any material respect any Law to which any
Acquired Company or any of the Assets are subject or bound.

3.5 Capitalization.

(a) Section 3.5 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true, correct and
complete list of (i) the authorized capital of each Acquired Company, (ii) the
number of issued and outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity

compliance with all Laws governing the issuance of securities and were not
issued in violation of (or subject to) any preemptive rights (including any

stock or other equity securities of any Acquired Company issuable upon

capital stock or other equity securities of any Acquired Company, or
Derivative Securities or other rights that are linked to the value of any
shares of capital stock or other equity securities of any Acquired Company;

repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of its capital stock or any
other equity securities or to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, any such shares of capital stock or other equity
securities.

(c) Except for any other Acquired Company, no Acquired Company has ever had
any direct or indirect subsidiaries or other predecessors, and no Acquired
Company presently owns, of record or beneficially, or controls, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock, securities convertible into capital stock or
any other equity interest in any Person (other than an Acquired Company),

liability company, trust, association or other non-corporate entity. There are
no trusts or similar entities or instruments of guardianship or custodianship,
whether enforceable or not, in existence for the benefit of any Acquired
Company.

unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of June 30,
2014 (the "Latest Balance Sheet Date") and the related statements of income
and cash flows for the six-month period then ended (collectively, the "Current
Financial Statements"). The balance sheet described in Section 3.6(a)(ii) is
referred to herein as the "Latest Balance Sheet."

(b) Accuracy of Financial Statements. The Financial Statements (including in
all cases any notes thereto) are accurate and complete in all material
respects, have been prepared from the books and records of the Acquired
Companies (which books and records are accurate and complete in all material
respects), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied
throughout the periods indicated, and fairly present the financial condition
and results of operations, cash flows and changes in owners' equity as at the
dates of, and for the periods covered by, such Financial Statements, except
that the Current Financial Statements do not include footnotes (which, if
presented, would not differ materially from those included in the December 31,
2013 Financial Statements) and are subject to customary year-end adjustments
(the effect of which adjustments will not, individually or in the aggregate,
be materially adverse). Since the Latest Balance Sheet Date, there have been
no material changes in the accounting policies of the Acquired Companies
(including any change in depreciation or amortization policies or rates, or
policies with respect to reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable or
excess or obsolete inventory) and no revaluation of any Acquired Company's
properties or assets. Section 3.6(b) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a
true, correct and complete list of all Indebtedness and identifies for each
item of Indebtedness the outstanding principal, the accrued but unpaid
interest and any applicable prepayment or call penalty or premium.

(c) Internal Controls. The Company maintains such internal accounting controls
and procedures as are necessary to provide reasonable assurance regarding the 

reliability of the financial statements of the Acquired Companies (including
the Financial Statements).

(d) Bank Accounts. Section 3.6(d) of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth each
bank or other depositary account held in the name of each Acquired Company
(including the financial institution, the account number and other relevant
identifying information) and the names of each individual authorized to make
withdrawals therefrom immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(e) Powers of Attorney. There are no outstanding powers of attorney executed
by or on behalf of any Acquired Company or, except as set forth in Article 12
or on Section 3.6(e) of the Disclosure Schedule, any Seller with respect to
the Business or any Acquired Company.

(f) Books and Records. At the Closing, all of the books and records used to
create the Financial Statements will be in the possession of the Acquired
Companies. The Company has delivered to Encore true, complete and correct
copies of all management letters and letters to or from the Acquired
Companies' accountants, if any, relating to any audit or review of the
financial statements or the underlying books and records of any Acquired
Company. The Company has reported to Encore in writing any fraud, whether or
not material, that involves management or other employees who participate in
the preparation of the Acquired Companies' financial statements or have a
significant role in the maintenance of the Acquired Companies' books and
records.

(g) No Undisclosed Liabilities. No Acquired Company has any Liability (nor is
there any Basis for any Liability of an Acquired Company), except for (i)
Liabilities set forth on the face of the Latest Balance Sheet (rather than in
any notes thereto), (ii) current Liabilities that have arisen after the Latest
Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course of Business (none of which arose out
of any Proceeding) and (iii) Liabilities arising in the Ordinary Course of
Business under Company Contracts.

Company Contract that has not been cured or waived. Each Acquired Company has
performed the material obligations required to be performed by it under each
Company Contract and is not in receipt of any notice of termination or written
claim of default under any such Company Contract. No party to any Company

intention to terminate or materially alter its relationship with any Acquired
Company or the Business. The Sellers have previously provided to Encore a true

3.9 Title to and Condition of Assets and Properties.

(a) Owned Real Property. None of the Acquired Companies own or purport to own
(or have ever owned) any real property.

(b) Leased Real Property. The Real Property Leases cover all of the real
property leased by any Acquired Company from a third party (collectively, the
"Leased Real Property"). The Leased Real Property constitutes all of the land,
buildings, structures, improvements, fixtures or other interests and rights in
real property that are used or occupied by the Acquired Companies in
connection with the Business. The Acquired Company named as lessee under each
Real Property Lease holds a valid, subsisting and enforceable leasehold
interest under such Real Property Lease, with such exceptions as do not
interfere in any material respect with the use made of such property in the
Business. No Acquired Company has assigned, transferred, conveyed or
encumbered any interest in any Real Property Leases or any of the Leased Real
Property. Except for the sublease of the facility located at 3351 Orange
Avenue N.E., Roanoke, Virginia 24036 by the Company, as sublessor, to the Law
Offices of John P. Frye, P.C. ("JPF"), as sublessee (the "Roanoke Sublease"),
no Acquired Company is a lessor, sublessor or grantor under any lease,
sublease, consent, license or other instrument granting to another person or
entity any right to the possession, use, occupancy or enjoyment of the Leased
Real Property. All of the Leased Real Property has access to public roads and
to all utilities necessary for the operation of the Business.

(c) Title to Personal Property Assets. The Acquired Companies own good and
valid title to all of the Owned Personal Property and all Receivables, free
and clear of all Security Interests other than Security Interests set forth in
Section 3.9(c) of the Disclosure Schedule (all of which will be released at
the Closing) and Permitted Security Interests. "Owned Personal Property" means
all of the tangible personal property and assets of the Acquired Companies
shown on the Latest Balance Sheet or acquired after the Latest Balance Sheet
Date and all of the intangible personal property and assets of the Acquired
Companies, in each case other than (i) tangible personal property and assets
sold or otherwise disposed of for fair value to non-affiliated third parties
in the Ordinary Course of Business 

since the Latest Balance Sheet Date and (ii) obsolete assets discarded in the
Ordinary Course of Business since the Latest Balance Sheet Date.

(d) Condition and Sufficiency of Assets. All of the Acquired Companies'
buildings, improvements, fixtures, physical plant, machinery, equipment and
other tangible assets are in good condition and repair, except for ordinary
wear and tear not caused by neglect, have been maintained in accordance with
the manufacturer specifications therefor and are useable in the Ordinary
Course of Business. The Leased Real Property, the Owned Personal Property, the
Receivables, the equipment that is leased by the Acquired Companies from third
parties pursuant to Company Contracts set forth in Section 3.8(b)(iii) of the
Disclosure Schedule and the Intellectual Property that is licensed by the
Acquired Companies from third parties pursuant to Company Contracts set forth
in Section 3.8(b)(iv) of the Disclosure Schedule include all of the assets,
properties and rights necessary for the conduct of the Business, consistent
with the past customs and practices of the Acquired Companies, and all assets,
properties and rights that were used to conduct the Business since the Latest
Balance Sheet Date.

3.10 Receivables; Collections of Receivables.

(a) An Acquired Company has good and marketable title to, and is the sole
owner of record and holder of, each of the Receivables free and clear of all
Security Interests other than Security Interests set forth on Section 3.10 of
the Disclosure Schedule (all of which will be released as of the Closing).

(b) Prior to the date hereof, the Company has delivered to Encore (i) the
electronic data files described on Exhibit E-1 attached hereto (the
"Receivable File"), identifying each Receivable and containing, with respect
to each Receivable, the data elements described on Exhibit E-2 as of June 30,
2014 and (ii) an electronic data file described on Exhibit E-3 attached hereto
(the "Chain of Title File"), which states, for each Receivable, the name and
address of the Original Creditor, the names and addresses of each Previous
Seller, and, the dates of transfer by the Original Creditor and each Previous
Seller prior to and as of June 30, 2014. All of the information contained in
the Chain of Title File and the Receivable File is based on the books and
records of the Acquired Companies (including the information contained in the
Notes and Assumptions attached to Section 3.10 of the Disclosure Schedule) and
is true, correct and complete in all material respects; provided, however,
that the Required Data is true, correct and complete in all respects. For
purposes of this Section 3.10:

(i) "Original Creditor" means, as to each Receivable, the lender who
originally granted the credit represented by such Receivable;

(ii) "Previous Seller" means any person or entity from which an Acquired
Company purchased a Receivable, or from which any other prior owner of a
Receivable (other than the Original Creditor) had purchased such Receivable;
and 

(iii) "Required Data" means those data elements on Exhibit E-2 marked with an
asterisk.

(c) The aggregate Unpaid Balance of all of the Receivables owned by the
Acquired Companies is set forth in the Receivable File. Except as set forth in
the Receivable File, the Unpaid Balance on each Purchased Account does not
include any interest, fees or other charges accrued by any Person since
charge-off.

(d) The Unpaid Balance of each Receivable (subject to changes in the amount
thereof due to payments received by the Acquired Companies or its agents or
representatives with respect to a Receivable on or after June 30, 2014) is the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the applicable debtor, except as
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and other
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally.

(e) Each of the Acquired Companies and each agent, representative or servicer
of any Acquired Company, including JPF, has acquired, serviced and maintained
the Receivables and, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, each of the Receivables
were originated, serviced, maintained by the originator thereof and each other
prior owner thereof, in each case, in compliance with industry standards and
all Laws, including without limitation, the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the Fair
Credit Billing Act. In the process of acquiring the Receivables, the Acquired
Companies: (i) undertook customary due diligence; (ii) obtained standard
representations and warranties, including representations and warranties that
the Receivables were originated, serviced, maintained and sold in compliance
with Law; (iii) obtained standard indemnities for breaches of representations
and warranties, and (iv) obtained assurances that the sellers of the
Receivables were at the time of the Acquired Company's acquisition of the
Receivables entities licensed and authorized to originate, own or service
consumer accounts in all applicable locations. No Company Contract relating to
the purchase of Receivables will become unenforceable by the Acquired Company
that is a party thereto as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(f) Each of the Serviced Receivables has been serviced by the Acquired
Companies, and all activities of the Acquired Companies in respect of a
Serviced Receivable have been conducted in the Ordinary Course of Business and
in compliance with all Laws, including without limitation, the Truth in
Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act and the Fair Credit Billing Act, and in compliance with all
terms and conditions of any Company Contract relating to such Serviced
Receivable.

(g) All of information contained in the Receivables File and the Chain of
Title File (a) constitutes the Acquired Companies' own business records
regarding the Receivables and (b) accurately reflects in all material respects
the information in the Acquired Companies' database. All of information
contained in the Receivables File and the Chain of Title File has been kept in
the regular course of the Acquired Companies' business, and was made or
compiled at or near the time of the event and recorded by (or 

from information transmitted by) a person (i) with knowledge of the data
entered into and maintained in the Acquired Companies' business records or
(ii) who caused the data to be entered into and maintained in the Acquired
Companies' business records. It is the regular practice of the Acquired
Companies' business to maintain and compile such data.

(h) Since April 7, 2014, no Acquired Company has purchased any Receivables
(other than pursuant to existing forward flow agreements) that have an
expected purchase multiple (i.e. estimated remaining collections divided by
purchase price) of less than 1.8 times. Section 3.10(h) of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth each purchase of Receivables by the Acquired Companies
since April 7, 2014.

3.11 Intellectual Property.

(a) Title. The Acquired Companies own or have the right to use all
Intellectual Property necessary for the operation of the Business as currently
conducted. No current or former employee, agent, consultant or contractor has
asserted any claims, in writing or orally, to any such Intellectual Property.

(b) No Infringement. The Acquired Companies have not interfered with,
infringed upon, misappropriated, or otherwise come into conflict with any
Intellectual Property rights of third parties, and neither the Acquired
Companies nor any of their respective directors, managers, officers and
employees with responsibility for Intellectual Property matters has ever
received any charge, complaint, claim, or notice alleging any such
interference, infringement, misappropriation, or violation. To the Knowledge
of the Sellers, no third party has interfered with, infringed upon,

Property rights of the Acquired Companies.

(c) Owned Intellectual Property. Section 3.11(c) of the Disclosure Schedule

that has been issued to any Acquired Company, (ii) each pending patent
application or application for trademark or copyright registration that any
Acquired Company has made and (iii) each license, agreement or other
permission that any Acquired Company has granted to any third party with
respect to Intellectual Property (together with any exceptions). The Sellers
have previously provided to Encore correct and complete copies of all such
patents, registrations, applications, licenses, agreements, and permissions
(as amended to date) and all other written documentation evidencing ownership
and prosecution (if applicable) of each such item. With respect to each item
of Intellectual Property that any Acquired Company owns, (A) an Acquired
Company possesses all right, title, and interest in and to the item, (B) the
item is not subject to any Order and (C) no Proceeding is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Sellers, threatened that challenges the legality, validity,
enforceability, use, or ownership of the item.

(d) Licensed Intellectual Property. Section 3.11(d) of the Disclosure Schedule
identifies each item of Intellectual Property that any third party owns and
that any Acquired Company uses pursuant to any license, sublicense, agreement
or permission (except that "off-the-shelf" software purchased for use in the
day-to-day operations of the 

Business need not be so identified). The Sellers have previously provided to
Encore correct and complete copies of all such licenses, sublicenses,
agreements and permissions (as amended to date). With respect to each such
item of third party Intellectual Property (including any such "off-the-shelf"
software), (i) the license, sublicense, agreement or permission covering the
item is (and will continue to be on substantially identical terms immediately
following the Closing) legal, valid, binding, enforceable and in full force
and effect, (ii) the license, sublicense, agreement or permission covering the
item (and to the Knowledge of the Sellers, the underlying item of Intellectual
Property) is not subject to any outstanding Order and (iii) no Proceeding is

(e) Databases; Personally Identifiable Information. Section 3.11(e) of the
Disclosure Schedule describes in reasonable detail all databases of Personally
Identifiable Information of debtors with respect to Receivables owned or used
by the Acquired Companies in connection with the operation of or otherwise
relating to the Business (the "Databases"), and the nature and quantity of
data contained therein. Following the Closing, the Databases will have at
least the same functionality as exists immediately prior to the Closing.
Except for use in collection activities in the Ordinary Course of Business and
in compliance with Law, none of the Acquired Companies have sold, assigned,
leased, transferred, permitted the use of or otherwise disclosed to any Person
any information contained in any of the Databases, including any Personally
Identifiable Information, and all information contained in the Databases has
been collected, used and maintained in accordance with all applicable privacy
Laws. The Closing will not violate any privacy policy applicable to any
Personally Identifiable Information contained in the Databases at the time
such Personally Identifiable Information was collected. For purposes hereof,

Company, the annual salary or hourly wage paid by the Acquired Companies to

with all Laws respecting terms and conditions of employment, including

them by the Acquired Companies during the most recently completed fiscal year
of the Acquired Companies and during the current fiscal year through June 30,
2014. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,
reasonably expected or threatened, between any Acquired Company, on the one
hand, and any or all of its current or former employees or independent
contractors, on the other hand (including any claims for actual or alleged
harassment or discrimination based on race, national origin, age, sex, sexual
orientation, religion, disability, or similar tortious conduct, breach of
contract, wrongful termination, defamation, intentional or negligent
infliction of emotional distress, interference with contract, improper
classification of workers or interference with actual or prospective economic
advantage). There are no claims pending (or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers,

Company is party to any collective bargaining agreement or other labor union
contract nor, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, are there any activities or
proceedings of any labor union to organize any employees of the Acquired
Companies. Neither the Business nor any Acquired Company is, or has ever been,

action by its employees. The Acquired Companies have provided or paid all
employees with all wages, benefits, relocation benefits, stock options,
bonuses and incentives and all other compensation that became due and payable
in accordance with the payroll practices of the Acquired Companies in the
Ordinary Course of Business through the date of this Agreement. No Acquired
Company has instituted any "freeze" of, or delayed or deferred the grant of,
any cost-of-living or other salary adjustments for any of its employees.

3.13 Employee Benefits.

(a) Section 3.13(a) of the Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate and
complete list of all Employee Benefit Plans (i) maintained or sponsored by any
Acquired Company, (ii) contributed to by any Acquired Company or to which any
Acquired Company is obligated to contribute or (iii) with respect to which any
Acquired Company has any liability or potential liability (whether direct or
indirect, including all Employee Benefit Plans contributed to, maintained or
sponsored by each member of the controlled group of companies, within the
meaning of Sections 414(b), (c) and (m) of the Code, of which any Acquired
Company is a member to the extent such Acquired Company has any liability or
potential liability with respect to such Employee Benefit Plans). The Employee
Benefit Plans disclosed or required to be disclosed in Section 3.13(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule are referred to collectively herein as the "Company
Employee Benefit Plans."

(b) There are no plans or agreements that would prevent any Acquired Company
from withdrawing from any "employee pension benefit plan" (within the meaning
set forth in ERISA Sec. 3(2)) that is contributed to by an Acquired Company
without any further obligation or liability. Except for the continuation
coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA or applicable state continuation coverage Law, no Acquired
Company has obligations or potential liability for benefits to employees,
former employees or their respective dependents following termination of
employment or retirement under any Company Employee Benefit Plan, whether or
not terminated, that provides health, life insurance, accident or other
"welfare-type" benefits to 

current or future retirees, current or future former employees, or current or
future former independent contractors, their spouses, dependents, or other
beneficiaries.

(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event such as termination of employment or other service) (i)
result in or cause any payment (whether of separation, severance or
termination pay or otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness,
vesting, distribution or increase in benefits with respect to any Company
Employee Benefit Plan or any current or former director, manager, officer,
employee or other service provider of any Acquired Company, or give rise to
any obligation to fund any such payment or benefit, (ii) limit the ability of
the Acquired Companies to amend or terminate any Company Employee Benefit Plan
or (iii) result in any payment or benefit that will or may be made that will
be characterized as an "excess parachute payment," within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. None of the Company Employee Benefit Plans obligates
any Acquired Company to pay separation, severance, termination or similar
benefits (whether or not resulting from the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby).

(d) With respect to each Company Employee Benefit Plan, all required payments,
premiums, contributions, reimbursements or accruals for all periods ending
prior to or as of the Closing shall have been made or properly accrued for on
the Financial Statements. No Company Employee Benefit Plan has any unfunded
liabilities.

(e) Each Company Employee Benefit Plan and all related trusts, insurance
contracts and funds have been maintained, funded and administered in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and all Laws, including
ERISA and the Code. No Acquired Company and no trustee or administrator of any
Company Employee Benefit Plan, or other person has engaged in any transaction
with respect to any Company Employee Benefit Plan that could subject any
Acquired Company or any trustee or administrator of such Company Employee
Benefit Plan, or any party dealing with such Company Employee Benefit Plan, to
any Tax or penalty (whether civil or otherwise) imposed by ERISA or the Code.
No Proceedings with respect to the Company Employee Benefit Plans (other than
routine claims for benefits) or any fiduciary or other person dealing with
such Company Employee Benefit Plans are pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, threatened and there are no facts that could reasonably give rise to
or reasonably be expected to give rise to any such Proceedings.

(f) No underfunded "defined benefit plan," as such term is defined in Section
3(35) of ERISA, has been, during the six (6) years preceding the Closing Date,
transferred out of the controlled group of companies (within the meaning of
Sections 414(b), (c) and (m) of the Code) of which any Acquired Company is a
member or was a member during such six-year period.

(g) No Seller, no Acquired Company and no officer, director, manager, employee
or agent of any Acquired Company has made any statements, whether oral or
written, regarding the Company Employee Benefit Plans or other compensation or
benefit 

arrangements to be maintained (or not to be maintained) by the Acquired
Companies after the Closing that will result in additional liability to the
Acquired Companies or Encore, whether direct or indirect, in excess of any
existing liability of the Acquired Companies as of the immediately prior to
the Closing.

Schedule, no Proceeding has been filed, commenced, threatened in writing or,

Acquired Companies or Sellers will provide to Encore, prior to Closing or as
otherwise mutually agreed upon all information or other assistance required by
Encore to obtain all consents required to assign, transfer or issue the
Business Permits to Encore and Encore will be responsible for the assignment,
transfer or issuance of Business Permits with or from the appropriate
Governmental Authority. The Acquired Companies are in material compliance with
the terms and conditions of all Business Permits and there has been no
material violation by any Acquired Company (or event that with the passage of
time, the giving of notice or both would constitute a violation) of any
Business Permit that has not been cured or waived. No Acquired Company has

compliance in all material respects with all applicable environmental Laws
that affect the Business or any properties or assets of any Acquired Company,
and no Proceeding has been filed, commenced or, to the Knowledge of the
Sellers, threatened against any Acquired Company alleging any such violation.
Neither any Acquired Company nor any predecessor entity has ever been charged
with (or, to the Knowledge of the Sellers, has been or is now under
investigation with respect to) any possible violation of any environmental
Law. Except for the items on Section 3.14(c) of the Disclosure Schedule, no
Acquired Company has received any notice from any Person (including any

violation or failure to comply with any environmental Law, (ii) any obligation
for any Acquired Company to undertake or bear the cost of any environmental
remediation or (iii) any harm to the environment at any property owned or

connection with the Business, including off-site disposal sites. The Acquired
Companies have timely filed all material reports, data and other information
required to be filed with governmental authorities under applicable
environmental Laws. Neither the Acquired Companies nor their respective
properties or assets are subject to any Order pursuant to any environmental
Law or in connection with hazardous materials or substances. No Acquired

pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching,
dumping or disposing into the environment, without giving effect to any
thresholds on quantity or time in any environmental Law) or placed any
hazardous materials or substances on, under or at any property owned or leased

Acquired Company is in default with respect to its obligations under any of

upon reasonable request to the employees, customers, vendors, suppliers and
creditors of the Acquired Companies. The Sellers shall and shall cause the
Company to, and the Company shall and shall cause each other Acquired Company
to, cooperate with Encore and its representatives in the preparation of any
documents or other material which may be required in connection with the
Transaction Documents.

(b) The Company, the Sellers and Encore acknowledge and agree that the Mutual
Non-Disclosure Agreement dated as of January 24, 2014 by and between Encore
and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") remains in full force and
effect and that information provided by the Company, any Seller or any of such
Seller's Affiliates to Encore, or by Encore or any of its Affiliates to the
Company or any Seller, pursuant to this Agreement prior to the Closing shall
be treated in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. If this Agreement
is terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. If the Closing occurs,
the Confidentiality Agreement, insofar as it covers information provided to
Encore or its Affiliates relating to the Business or any Acquired Company,
shall terminate effective 

as of the Closing, but shall remain in effect insofar as it covers other
information provided by or on behalf of the Company or the Sellers to Encore
thereunder.

(a) The Sellers shall not and shall cause the Company not to, and the Company
shall not and shall cause each other Acquired Company not to, and each such
foregoing person shall cause its respective representatives and Affiliates not
to, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit, encourage or otherwise
facilitate any inquiry, proposal, offer or discussion with any party (other
than Encore and its representatives, agents and Affiliates) concerning (A) any
merger, liquidation, recapitalization, consolidation or other business
combination involving any Acquired Company or acquisition of any capital stock
or other securities of any Acquired Company, or any material portion of the
assets of any Acquired Company, or any combination of the foregoing (excluding
the transactions contemplated hereby), or (B) any agreement, arrangement or
understanding requiring any Acquired Company or any Seller to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(each, an "Acquisition Transaction"), (ii) furnish any information concerning
the Business (or any portion thereof) or the properties or assets of the
Acquired Companies to any Person (other than Encore) or (iii) engage in
discussions or negotiations with any party (other than Encore) concerning any
Acquisition Transaction.

(b) The Sellers shall and shall cause the Company to, and the Company shall
and shall cause each other Acquired Company to, and each such foregoing person
shall cause its respective representatives and Affiliates to, (i) immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations of the nature described in Section
6.3(a) that were pending, (ii) immediately notify any party with which such
discussions or negotiations were being held of such termination, (iii)
immediately request in writing that all Persons to whom nonpublic information
concerning any Acquired Company has been distributed on or prior to the date
of this Agreement return or destroy such information to the Company as soon as
possible, and (iv) refrain from entering into any Acquisition Transaction.

(c) The Sellers shall and shall cause the Company to, and the Company shall
and shall cause each other Acquired Company to, and each such foregoing person

inquiry, proposal or other materials, and of any discussions, negotiations or
proposals relating to, an Acquisition Transaction, (ii) promptly identify the
offeror, and (iii) promptly provide Encore copies of all correspondence

arrangements or understandings with respect to any Acquisition Transaction
(and a description of any proposed oral agreements with respect thereto). The
Company and the Sellers shall promptly advise Encore of all subsequent
communications relating to such proposal.

6.4 Notification of Certain Matters. The Sellers and the Company shall give
prompt notice (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) to the other
Parties of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or
non-occurrence of which would or would be reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of the Sellers and the Company 

contained herein to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any
time at or prior to the Closing, or which would constitute a Material Adverse
Change, (b) any event which would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
conditions in Article 7 not to be fulfilled, and (c) any material failure of
such Party to comply with or satisfy in a timely manner any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by such Party
hereunder. The delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall in no
circumstance be deemed to (i) modify the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements hereunder of the Party delivering such notice or the
Disclosure Schedule, (ii) modify any of the conditions set forth in Article 7,
or (iii) cure or prevent any misrepresentation, inaccuracy, untruth or breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document or failure to satisfy any
condition set forth in Article 7.

6.5 Hiring of JPF Employees. Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall
make offers of employment to those certain employees of JPF listed on Schedule
6.5 (the "Employee Offerees"). Such offers shall be made pursuant to a form of
offer letter (including confidentiality provisions or a separate
confidentiality agreement attached thereto) approved by Encore in writing (the
"Employee Offer Letters") and the salary and title to be offered to each such
Employee Offeree shall be as is set forth opposite such employee's name on
Schedule 6.5. The Company shall use its best efforts to cause the Employee
Offerees to accept employment with the Company prior to the Closing Date;

the Employee Offerees for their acceptance of the offered position other than
as is set forth on Schedule 6.5.

6.6 Roanoke Call Center. After the date hereof and prior to the Closing, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to amend the Roanoke
Sublease, pursuant to an agreement approved by Encore in writing, such that
the portion of the premises subleased pursuant to the Roanoke Sublease (the
"Roanoke Call Center") that was used by the Employee Offerees prior to the
Closing shall no longer be subleased to JPF and shall be office space of the
Company from and after the Closing.

6.7 Cause Conditions to be Satisfied; Further Assurances. Each Seller and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each of the conditions set
forth in Section 7.1 to be satisfied at or prior to the Closing; provided
that, in seeking to satisfy such conditions, the Sellers shall not and shall
cause the Company not to, and the Company shall not and shall cause each other
Acquired Company not to, (i) waive or discharge any liabilities or obligations
owing to any of the Acquired Companies by any counterparty to any such Company
Contract, (ii) waive any rights of any of the Acquired Companies under any
such Company Contract, or (iii) amend, modify, supplement or otherwise change
the terms of any such Company Contract; (b) Encore shall use reasonable best
efforts to cause each of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 to be
satisfied at or prior to the Closing; and (c) each Party shall cooperate in
filing all notices and obtaining all consents and approvals required by
Section 2.4(b)(iv) (it being agreed that such filings and consents shall
nonetheless be the responsibility of the Sellers and the Company). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Sellers and the Acquired Companies shall cooperate
with Encore, as requested by Encore, in order to secure or obtain the consent
to the transfer of, or the issuance or grant of, any Business Permit.

ARTICLE 8

TERMINATION

8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Closing solely:

(a) by mutual written consent of Encore and the Company;

(b) by either Encore or the Company if the Closing shall not have occurred by
November 26, 2014 (the "Termination Date");

(c) by either Encore or the Company, if any Governmental Authority shall have
issued a final, non-appealable Order, or there shall exist any Law, in each
case that prohibits, makes illegal, enjoins or prevents the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby;

(d) by Encore (if it is not in material breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants and obligations under the Transaction Documents) if
there has been a breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Company and/or any Seller set forth in the
Transaction Documents, which breach or inaccuracy would cause any condition
set forth in Section 7.1 not to be satisfied if it remained uncured as of the
Termination Date (and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured or such
condition has not been satisfied within ten (10) Business Days after the
receipt of written notice thereof); or

(e) by the Company (if neither it nor any Seller is in material breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations under the Transaction
Documents) if there has been a breach of, or inaccuracy in, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Encore set forth in the
Transaction Documents, which breach or inaccuracy would cause any condition
set forth in Section 7.2 not to be satisfied if it remained uncured as of the
Termination Date (and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured or such 

condition has not been satisfied within ten (10) Business Days after the
receipt of written notice thereof).

8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of any termination of this Agreement

further force or effect, and no Party (or any of its Affiliates or
representatives) shall have any liability or obligation hereunder, except (i)
the provisions of Article 1 (definitions), Article 13 (Miscellaneous) and
Sections 6.2(b) (continued effect of Confidentiality Agreement) and 8.2
(effect of termination) shall survive any such termination and (ii) nothing
herein shall relieve any Party from liability for fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach of the Transaction Documents prior to such
termination.

ARTICLE 9

POST-CLOSING COVENANTS

9.1 Cooperation in Litigation. In the event that a claim is asserted against
Encore or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including, after the Closing,
the Acquired Companies) with respect to the Business, any of the Acquired
Companies or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, each Seller
severally and not jointly shall (and, prior to Closing, the Sellers shall
cause the Company to, and the Company shall and shall cause each other
Acquired Company to) cooperate with Encore in the defense of such claim. Each
Seller severally and not jointly shall (and, prior to Closing, the Sellers
shall cause the Company to, and the Company shall and shall cause each other
Acquired Company to) reasonably consult with Encore regarding the defense of
any proceedings or litigation against the Company or any Seller relating to
any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

9.2 Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation and Confidentiality.

(a) Prohibited Activities. As further consideration for the purchase and sale
of the Shares and the other transactions contemplated hereby:

(i) (A) each Seller of Common Shares as set forth on Schedule 1 severally and
not jointly covenants and agrees with Encore that during the period of three
(3) years following the Closing Date; and (B) each Seller of Class B Shares on
Schedule 1 severally and not jointly covenants and agrees with Encore that
during the period of two (2) years following the Closing Date, in each case,
such Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly, for such Seller or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other
Person, engage in the United States as an owner, officer, director, employee,
consultant, independent contractor, subcontractor, leased employee, volunteer,
temporary worker, equityholder, lender, agent or otherwise, in any business,
or in developing, selling, manufacturing, distributing or marketing any
product or service, that competes directly or indirectly, or is reasonably
likely to compete directly or indirectly, with the Business and provided that
this Section 9.2(a)(i) shall not prohibit any Seller from owning less 

than three percent (3%) of the outstanding common stock of a company, the
common stock of which is traded on a national stock exchange; and

(ii) each Seller severally and not jointly covenants and agrees with Encore
that such Seller shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, during the
period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, directly or indirectly,
for such Seller or on behalf of or in conjunction with any other Person (A)
employ or hire away any Restricted Person or (B) solicit or communicate with
any Restricted Person for the purpose or with the intent of enticing, or in a
manner reasonably likely to entice, such Restricted Person away from Encore;
provided that this Section 9.2(a)(ii) shall not at any time prohibit (x) any
Seller from soliciting or hiring any Restricted Persons who are not management
or other key employees of an Acquired Company whose employment or other
service providing relationship with Encore has been terminated by Encore or
(y) the placement of advertisements in publications of general circulation not
directed at any Restricted Person. "Restricted Person" means any Person who
is, at that time, or who has been, within twelve (12) months prior to that
time, within the United States, an employee, contractor, subcontractor,
consultant or sales representative of any Acquired Company.

The time periods referenced in this Section 9.2(a) shall be automatically
extended with respect to a certain Seller by the number of days that such
Seller and/or their respective Affiliates are found to have been in violation
of the provisions of this Section 9.2(a). For purposes of this Section 9.2(a),
the term "Encore" means Encore and any present or future Affiliate of Encore.
Additionally, as partial consideration for the restrictive covenants provided
by each Seller of Class B Shares on Schedule 1 pursuant to this Section
9.2(a), Encore agrees to cause the Company to pay to any such Seller upon such
Seller's separation from the Acquired Companies (including by termination or
resignation) prior to the payment of the 2014 bonus amount to such Seller, an
amount equal to the accrued and unpaid 2014 bonus due to be paid to such
Seller by any Acquired Company.

(b) Reasonable Restraint. Each Seller acknowledges, in connection with the
restrictions set forth in Section 9.2(a)(i) that: (i) it is the intention of
the Parties that the entire goodwill of the Acquired Companies and the
Business be transferred to Encore as part of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the goodwill existing between the Acquired Companies, on the
one hand, and their respective clients, customers, suppliers, agents,
employees, consultants, and other persons under Contract or otherwise
associated or doing business with them, on the other hand; (ii) that the
Sellers and Encore explicitly considered the value of the goodwill to be
transferred and that such goodwill is valued as a component of the
consideration to be paid by Encore pursuant to the terms hereof; and (iii)
that the covenants set forth in this Section 9.2 are a material and
substantial part of the transactions contemplated hereby (supported by
adequate consideration), and Encore's failure to receive the entire goodwill
contemplated hereby would have the effect of significantly reducing the value
of the Shares, the Acquired Companies and the Business to Encore. 

(c) Reformation. In the event any court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that the scope, time or territorial restrictions set forth in
Section 9.2(a) are unreasonable, then it is the intention of the Parties that
such restrictions be enforced to the fullest extent which the court deems
reasonable and the Agreement shall thereby be reformed.

(d) Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges that the other Parties will
be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate remedy at law for any
violation by any Party of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this
Section 9.2. It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other remedies
which may be available upon the breach of any such covenants or agreements,
Encore shall have the right to injunctive relief to restrain a breach or
threatened breach of, or otherwise to obtain specific performance of, each
Seller's covenants and agreements contained in this Section 9.2, in any court
of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties
and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled,
at law or in equity.

(e) Independent Covenant. All of the covenants in this Section 9.2 shall be
construed as an agreement independent of any other provision in the
Transaction Documents, and the existence of any claim or cause of action of
the Company or any Seller against Encore, whether predicated on this Agreement
or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by Encore of
such covenants. The Parties expressly acknowledge that the terms and
conditions of this Section 9.2 are independent of the terms and conditions of
any other agreements including, but not limited to, any employment agreements
entered into in connection with this Agreement. The covenants contained in
Section 9.2 shall not be affected by any breach of any other provision hereof
by any Party.

9.3 Confidential Information.

(a) Definition. "Confidential Information" means (i) the terms and conditions
of this Agreement (including the consideration to be paid hereunder) and the
course of dealing between the Parties hereunder (including any dispute between
the Parties), and (ii) any trade secrets, know-how, technical data or
proprietary information of any Acquired Company, including information
relating to products, properties, services, processes, designs, formulas,
developmental or experimental work, improvements, discoveries, plans for
research or products, databases, computer programs, other original works of
authorship, marketing and sales plans, business plans, proprietary lending
strategies, budgets and financial information, prices and costs, customer
lists, supplier lists, information regarding the skills and compensation of
the employees and contractors of any Acquired Company and other non-public
business information. The term "Confidential Information" includes all of the
foregoing information, rights and materials, whether tangible or intangible,
whether oral or in written, electronic or other form, in all stages of
research and development, and whether now existing, or previously developed or
created. "Confidential Information" does not include any information that is
or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result, directly
or indirectly, of a breach of this Section 9.3, or other legal or fiduciary
obligation of confidentiality owing to Encore or any Acquired Company, by any
Person that is subject to this Section 9.3. 

(b) Covenant. Each Seller covenants and agrees that it will (and that it will
cause each of its Affiliates, employees, agents and representatives to), at
all times after the Closing, maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential
Information, using procedures no less rigorous than those used to protect and
preserve the confidentiality of its own proprietary information and not,
directly or indirectly: (i) use, disclose or permit any other Person to have
access to any Confidential Information (except in the good faith performance
of any employment or contractual obligations owed to any Acquired Company or,
subject to Section 9.3(c), as required by Law or legal process), (ii) sell,
license or otherwise exploit any products or services that embody, in whole or
in part, any Confidential Information or (iii) take any other action with
respect to the Confidential Information that is inconsistent with the
confidential and proprietary nature thereof.

(c) Compulsory Disclosure. If any Person that is subject to this Section 9.3
is requested or required to disclose any Confidential Information pursuant to
a subpoena, court order or other similar process, such Person must provide
notice to Encore of such request or requirement so that Encore may seek an
appropriate protective order. In the event that no such protective order is
issued and such Person is, in the opinion of its counsel, compelled to
disclose such Confidential Information under pain of liability for contempt of
court or other censure or penalty, such Person may disclose such Confidential
Information in accordance with and for the limited purpose of compliance with
such subpoena, court order or process, without liability under this Section
9.3.

9.4 Releases. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller (a) waives any and all
rights of indemnification, contribution and other similar rights against the
Acquired Companies (whether arising pursuant to any Acquired Company's Charter
Documents, any Contract, any Law or otherwise) arising out of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the
Transaction Documents and/or out of the negotiation, execution and performance
of the Transaction Documents, and agrees that any claim of any Encore
Indemnitee, whether for indemnity or otherwise, may be asserted directly
against all of the Sellers or any Seller (to the extent provided herein),
without any need for any claim against, or joinder of, any Acquired Company
and (b) forever waives, releases and discharges (and hereby agrees to cause
each of its representatives to forever waive, release and discharge) with
prejudice each Acquired Company and each of its officers, directors, agents
and other representatives from any and all claims, rights (including rights of
indemnification, contribution and other similar rights, from whatever source,
whether under contract, law or otherwise), causes of action, protests, suits,
disputes, orders, obligations, debts, demands, proceedings, contracts,
agreements, promises, liabilities, controversies, costs, expenses, fees
(including attorneys' fees), or damages of any kind, arising by any means
(including subrogation, assignment, reimbursement, operation of law or
otherwise), whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, accrued or not
accrued, foreseen or unforeseen, or matured or unmatured related or with
respect to, in connection with, or arising out of, directly or indirectly, any
event, fact, condition, circumstance, occurrence, act or omission that was in
existence (or that occurred or failed to occur) at or prior to the Closing;
provided, however, this clause (b) shall not be construed as releasing any
party from its obligations otherwise expressly set forth in any Transaction
Document. 

9.5 Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing Date, upon request
of any Party, each Party shall execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other
instruments and documents and shall take all such other actions required to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents; provided that Encore shall not be required to pay any further
consideration or amounts therefor. Without limiting the foregoing, the Sellers
and the Acquired Companies shall cooperate with Encore, as requested by
Encore, in order to secure or obtain the consent to the transfer of, or the
issuance or grant of, any Business Permit.

ARTICLE 10

INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 Risk Allocation. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made herein are intended, among other things, to allocate among the
Parties the risks inherent in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
With respect to any claim for indemnification under this Article 10 relating
to a breach of a representation or warranty that contains a materiality
qualifier (including "in all material respects" and "Material Adverse
Change"), such materiality qualifier will be disregarded for purposes of
determining whether a breach of such representation and warranty has occurred
and for purposes of determining the amount of the Losses arising out of such
breach (other than the use of "Material Adverse Change" in the first sentence
of Section 3.7).

10.2 Survival.

(a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
Sellers and Encore set forth in this Agreement, and in any certificate or
instrument delivered at the Closing, shall survive the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and the Closing and continue in full force and effect
thereafter until the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing Date, except
that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.10
(Receivables; Collections of Receivables) and Section 3.14 (Legal Compliance;
Permits) shall survive until the five (5) year anniversary of the Closing
Date, (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.13
(Employee Benefits) and Section 3.16 (Taxes) will survive until thirty (30)
days after the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto and
(iii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1
(Organization); Section 3.2 (Qualification; Due Execution; Power and
Authority); Section 3.3 (Company Records/Authority); Section 3.4 (Non-
Contravention); Section 3.5 (Capitalization); Section 3.20 (Brokers' Fees);
Section 4.1 (Organization); Section 4.2 (Authorization of Transaction);
Section 4.3 (Due Execution; Enforceability); Section 4.4 (Non-Contravention);
Section 4.7 (Title to Securities) and Section 4.9 (Brokers' Fees)
(collectively, the "Fundamental Representations")will survive indefinitely. No
claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3 or Section 10.4 based on
the breach of a representation or warranty may be asserted after the date on
which such representation or warranty expires, except to the extent that such
claim is based on fraud in which case it may be asserted at any time prior to
the expiration of the statute of limitations applicable thereto. A claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 10.3 or Section 10.4 based on the breach
of a representation or warranty that is asserted prior to the date on which
such representation 

or warranty expires may be maintained until such claim is finally resolved in
accordance with this Article 10.

(b) Covenants. All covenants and agreements made by the Parties in this
Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
Closing and continue in full force and effect thereafter for so long as such
covenants remain executory in nature.

10.3 Indemnification by the Sellers. Subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 10.6, from and after the Closing, the Sellers shall be obligated to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless (including by reimbursement for Losses)
Encore and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) and their
respective directors, managers, officers, employees and agents (collectively,
the "Encore Indemnitees") from and against the entirety of any Loss that any
Encore Indemnitee may suffer that results from, arises out of, relates to, is
in the nature of, or is caused by, any one or more of the following:

(a) any misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty contained in Article 3 or in any certificate or instrument delivered
at the Closing by or on behalf of the Sellers (or any allegation by a third
party that, if true, would constitute such a breach or inaccuracy);

(b) any misrepresentation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation or
warranty contained in Article 4 (or any allegation by a third party that, if
true, would constitute such a breach or inaccuracy);

(c) any breach or non-performance by any Seller of any covenant, agreement or
undertaking contained in this Agreement or the failure of the Sellers'
Representative to make any Leakage Payment when due;

(d) any Order, Proceeding, investigation, fine, penalty, restitution

Agreement: (i) federal income taxes (exclusive of penalties and interest)
assessed against the Acquired Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period related

during any Pre- 

Closing Tax Period up to an aggregate amount equal to the federal income tax

Sheet and (ii) state taxes (exclusive of penalties and interest) assessed
against the Acquired Companies for a Pre-Closing Tax Period related to any
state tax nexus decision during a Pre-Closing Tax Period up to an aggregate

including any option, preemptive rights or rights to notice or to vote; (iii)
any rights under any of the Company's Charter Documents; or (iv) any claim
that his, her or its shares or other equity securities of any Acquired Company
were wrongfully repurchased, cancelled, terminated or transferred by the
Company or any Person.

10.4 Indemnification by Encore. From and after the Closing, Encore shall be
obligated to indemnify, defend and hold harmless (including by reimbursement
for Losses) each Seller and its Affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from
and against the entirety of any Loss that any Seller Indemnitee may suffer
that results from, arises out of, relates to, is in the nature of, or is
caused by, any one or more of the following:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
Article 5 or in any certificate or instrument delivered at the Closing by or
on behalf of Encore (or any allegation by a third party that, if true, would
constitute such a breach or inaccuracy); and

(b) any breach or non-performance by Encore of any covenant, agreement or
undertaking contained in this Agreement.

10.5 Matters Involving Third Parties.

(a) Notice. If any third party (including any Taxing Authority) shall make or
assert a claim against any party entitled to indemnification hereunder (the
"Indemnified Party") with respect to any matter that may give rise to a claim
for indemnification against a party required to provide indemnification under
this Article 10 (the "Indemnifying Party"), then the Indemnified Party shall
notify each Indemnifying Party thereof promptly; provided, however, that no
delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability or obligation under
this 

Agreement unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party is
damaged or prejudiced thereby.

(b) Defense and Settlement of Claims. In the case of (A) any such claim
described in Section 10.5(a) or (B) any claim of a third party (including any
Taxing Authority) existing as of the Closing Date against any Indemnified
Party with respect to any matter that may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against an Indemnifying Party, in each case, pursuant to which
only the recovery of a sum of money is being sought and the Indemnifying Party
enters into an agreement with the Indemnified Party (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party) pursuant to which the
Indemnifying Party agrees to be fully responsible (with no reservation of any
rights other than the right to be subrogated to the rights of the Indemnified
Party) for all Losses relating to such claim, the Indemnifying Party may, by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume the defense thereof
(including any discussions or settlement negotiations with such Taxing
Authority). In such case, (i) the Indemnifying Party will defend the
Indemnified Party against such matter with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, subject to approval of an insurance
company providing coverage for the Losses, if any, and (ii) the Indemnified
Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense (except that
the Indemnifying Party will be responsible for the fees and expenses of any
separate counsel to the Indemnified Party incurred prior to the date upon
which the Indemnifying Party effectively assumes control of such defense). In
the event that the Indemnifying Party is not entitled to, or does not, assume
control of the defense of a claim pursuant to the terms of this Section
10.5(b), the Indemnifying Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole
cost and expense to participate in such defense and, in any event, the
Indemnified Party shall (A) provide the Indemnifying Party with all material
information requested by such party relating to the defense of such claim, (B)
confer with the Indemnifying Party as to the most cost-effective manner in
which to defend such claim and (C) use its reasonable efforts to minimize the
cost of defending such claim. The Indemnified Party will not consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such matter
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld
unreasonably), and the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such matter without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Party determines in good
faith that there is a reasonable probability that a claim may adversely affect
it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it
would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party may, by notice to the Indemnifying Party, assume the exclusive right to
defend, compromise or settle such claim, but the Indemnifying Party will not
be bound by any determination of any claim so defended for the purposes of
this Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent
(which may not be unreasonably withheld). 

10.6 Limitations on Liability.

(a) Threshold Amount.

(i) The Encore Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 10.3(a) or Section 10.3(b) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses
for which indemnification under Section 10.3(a) and Section 10.3(b) is sought
by the Encore Indemnitees, collectively, exceeds $250,000 (the "Threshold
Amount"), at which time the Encore Indemnitees shall be entitled to
indemnification for all such Losses above the Threshold Amount; provided,
however, that the limitation set forth in this Section 10.6(a)(i) shall not be
applicable to any Losses resulting from either (A) fraud or (B) any breach or
inaccuracy (or any allegation by a third party that, if true, would constitute
a breach or inaccuracy) of the Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.13 (Employee Benefits)
or Section 3.16 (Taxes).

(ii) The Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 10.4(a) unless the aggregate amount of all Losses for which
indemnification under Section 10.4(a) is sought by the Seller Indemnitees,
collectively, exceeds the Threshold Amount, at which time the Seller
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification for all such Losses above the
Threshold Amount; provided, however, that the limitation set forth in this
Section 10.6(a)(ii) shall not be applicable to any Losses resulting from
fraud.

(b) Cap. The aggregate liability of the Sellers to the Encore Indemnitees
pursuant to Section 10.3(a), Section 10.3(b), Section 10.3(d) and Section
10.3(e) shall not exceed ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ($11,000,000) (the "Cap") and
the aggregate liability of Encore to the Seller Indemnitees pursuant to
Section 10.4(a) shall not exceed the Cap; provided, however, that the Cap
shall not be applicable to any Losses resulting from either (i) fraud or (ii)
any breach or inaccuracy (or any allegation by a third party that, if true,
would constitute a breach or inaccuracy) of the Fundamental Representations or
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.13 (Employee
Benefits) or Section 3.16 (Taxes).

(c) Limited Liability of the Sellers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, a Seller shall not be liable to the Encore Indemnitees for:
any Losses that any Encore Indemnitee may suffer as a result of any matter
described in Section 10.3(b) or Section 10.3(c) to the extent that such matter
relates to (A) the breach or inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
made by or on behalf of any Seller other than such Seller or (B) the breach or
non-performance by any Seller other than such Seller of any covenant,
agreement or undertaking contained in this Agreement.

(d) Disclaimer of Special Damages. Each Party waives any rights to assert or
receive any indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or punitive damages
suffered or incurred by such Party as a result of the breach by another Party
of any of its representations, warranties or obligations hereunder. For
purposes of the foregoing, actual 

damages may, however, include indirect, consequential, special, exemplary or
punitive damages to the extent that (a) the injuries or losses resulting in or
giving rise to such damages are incurred or suffered by a third party that is
not an Indemnified Party or an Affiliate of any Indemnified Party and (b) such
damages are required to be paid by an Indemnified Party to a third party.

10.7 Procedures for Assertion of Claims.

(a) Claim Certificate. In connection with any claim (including any Tax claim)
for reimbursement of Losses subject to indemnification under this Article 10,
including any Losses attributable to matters subject to Section 10.5 that are
not paid by an Indemnifying Party directly to third parties, the Party seeking
reimbursement (the "Claimant") shall prepare, and deliver to the party from
which reimbursement is sought (the "Respondent"), a certificate (a "Claim
Certificate"): (i) stating that the Claimant has paid or sustained Losses
subject to indemnification pursuant to this Article 10 and (ii) specifying in
reasonable detail the Loss included in the amount so stated.

(b) Resolution of Claims. As soon as practicable following the delivery of a
Claim Certificate, the Sellers' Representative and Encore shall attempt to
agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each claim set
forth therein. If the Sellers' Representative and Encore should so agree, a
written memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed
by the Sellers' Representative and Encore, and a copy of such memorandum shall
be delivered to the Claimant and the Respondent. Such memorandum and the
agreements contained therein shall be final and binding on the Sellers'
Representative, Encore, the Claimant, the Respondent and all other Persons
having any interest therein.

(c) Failure to Resolve Objections. If the Sellers' Representative and Encore
cannot agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of
the claims in a Claim Certificate within thirty (30) days after delivery of
the Claim Certificate (as such period may be extended only by mutual written
agreement of the Sellers' Representative and Encore, by giving notice thereof
to the Claimant and the Respondent), the Claimant may pursue any and all legal
remedies that may be available to it.

(d) Entitlement to Indemnity. The Claimant shall be entitled to receive
payment for all amounts that the Respondent (i) has agreed in writing to pay,
(ii) is obligated to pay pursuant to a written memorandum between the Sellers'
Representative and Encore pursuant to Section 10.7(b) or (iii) has been found
liable to pay pursuant to a final order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

(e) Payment of Claims. The Respondent shall pay all amounts to which a
Claimant is entitled promptly upon demand of the Claimant (and in any case,
within five (5) Business Days after such demand) by certified check or wire
transfer of immediately available funds, as the Claimant may specify. 

10.8 Recourse to Escrow Amount. After a claim has been established in
accordance with Section 10.5 and/or Section 10.7, and for so long as the
Escrow Agreement is in full force and effect and to the extent that there are
any funds held in the escrow account governed by the Escrow Agreement, an
Encore Indemnitee shall make a claim for payment against the Escrow Amount in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement for reimbursement of any amount that an
Encore Indemnitee is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 10.7(d), and only
to the extent that such entitlement is not satisfied from the Escrow Amount
will such Encore Indemnitee be entitled to a direct payment pursuant to
Section 10.7(e).

10.9 Exclusive Remedy. Except for claims for specific performance of the terms
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 13.15 or claims based upon fraud, the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Article 10 will be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to any and all claims
from and after the Closing relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

ARTICLE 11

TAX MATTERS

11.1 Preparation of Tax Returns.

(a) In General. Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.1(b), and with
respect to each Tax Return covering either (i) a Tax period or year commencing
at or before and ending after the Closing Date (each, a "Straddle Period") or
(ii) a Tax period ending at or before the Closing Date or a portion of any
Straddle Period that ends at and includes the Closing Date (each, a "Pre-
Closing Tax Period") that, in any such case, is required to be filed for, by,
on behalf of or with respect to any Acquired Company after the Closing Date,
Encore (A) shall prepare or cause to be prepared each such Tax Return and (B)
shall determine the portion of the Taxes shown as due on such Tax Return that
is allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion of the Taxes shown as
due on such Tax Return that is allocable to the Tax period (or portion
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date (each, a "Post-Closing Tax Period"),
which determination shall be set forth in a statement ("Statement") prepared
by Encore. Encore shall deliver a copy of such Tax Return and the Statement
related thereto (including related work papers) to the Sellers' Representative
for its review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) sufficiently in advance of the due date (including any
extensions thereof) for filing such Tax Return to provide the Sellers'
Representative with a meaningful opportunity to analyze and comment on such
Tax Return and have such Tax Return modified before the filing of such Tax
Return. With respect to each Tax Return described in this Section 11.1(a) and
in Section 11.1(b), Encore and each Seller, as applicable, will join in the
execution and filing of such Tax Return and other documentation as required by
Law.

(b) Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of Section 11.1(a), the Sellers' Representative shall cause to be timely
prepared in a manner consistent with past practice, Law and this Agreement all
Tax Returns for income Taxes with respect to the Acquired Companies for all
taxable periods ending at or before 

the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date, including for those
jurisdictions and Taxing Authorities that permit or require a short period Tax
Return for income Taxes for the period ending at and including the Closing
Date, for each of Acquired Company covering the taxable period beginning on
January 1, 2014, and ending at and including the Closing Date. The Sellers
shall bear the costs of the preparation of all such Tax Returns. The Sellers'
Representative shall provide Encore with copies of completed drafts of each
such Tax Return at least forty-five (45) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) for filing thereof, along with supporting workpapers, for Encore's
review and approval. Within twenty-five (25) days of such delivery, Encore
shall deliver to the Sellers' Representative a written statement describing
any objections to such Tax Return. If the Sellers' Representative and Encore
are unable to resolve any such objection within the twenty (20) day period
after the delivery of such objections, such Tax Return shall be filed as
prepared by the Sellers' Representative, as adjusted to the extent necessary
to reflect the resolution of any such objections mutually agreed to by the
Sellers' Representative and Encore.

11.2 Straddle Period Allocation. Except as otherwise provided in the next
sentence, in the case of any Straddle Period, the amount of any Taxes
allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of such Straddle Period shall
be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date. In the case of any liability for any real or
personal property Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period, the total amount of
such Taxes allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period
shall be the product of (a) such Tax for the entirety of such Straddle Period,
multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days for
such Straddle Period included in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period, and
the balance of such Taxes shall be allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.

11.3 Transfer Taxes. All documentary, sales, use, registration and other
transfer Taxes (including all applicable real estate transfer or securities
transfer Taxes) and fees incurred in connection with this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
Sellers.

11.4 Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Parties shall cooperate fully, as and to
the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns, and in connection with any audit or Proceeding,
including making employees available on a mutually convenient basis in
connection therewith. Upon request by Encore, the Sellers shall deliver to
Encore originals or copies of all books and records within the Sellers'
control with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The Parties agree to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Taxing Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce
or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on any Party as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

11.5 Conflict. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this
Article 11 and any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions of this
Article 11 shall control. 

11.6 Survival; Exclusivity. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, each Party's representations, warranties, covenants, agreements,
rights and obligations with respect to any Tax or Tax matter covered by this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall not terminate until thirty (30)
days after the expiration of all statutes of limitations (including any and
all extensions thereof) applicable to such Tax (or the assessment thereof) or
Tax matter.

11.7 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Parties agree to treat any
indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign income Tax purposes.

11.8 Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements. The Sellers shall cause any and
all Tax sharing or allocation agreements, intercompany agreements or other
agreements or arrangements between or among one or more of the Acquired
Companies and any one or more other Persons relating to any Tax matters to be
terminated with respect to each of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing
Date, and from and after the Closing Date, the Acquired Companies shall not be
bound thereby or have any liability thereunder for any taxable period (whether
past, current or future taxable periods).

ARTICLE 12

SELLERS' REPRESENTATIVE

12.1 Appointment and Powers. Each of the Sellers hereby appoints Richard
Woolwine as such Seller's attorney-in-fact (in such capacity, the "Sellers'
Representative"), with full power and authority, including power of
substitution, acting in the name of and for and on behalf of such Seller to:

(a) resolve any disputes with Encore pursuant to any Leakage Payment;

(b) pursue, defend and settle any indemnification claims, whether made by or
against the Sellers, pursuant to Article 10, and to do all other things and to
take all other actions after the Closing that the Sellers' Representative may
consider necessary or appropriate to resolve any such indemnification claims;

(c) authorize the Escrow Agent to release all or any portion of the Escrow
Amount to Encore Indemnitees in satisfaction of (i) any Leakage Payment or
(ii) any indemnification claims made by such Encore Indemnitees;

(d) establish a bank account in the name of the Sellers' Representative (as
representative of the Sellers), at such bank as may be designated by the
Sellers' Representative, and to receive and disburse from such account any
payments of Purchase Price to which the Sellers may be entitled pursuant to
this Agreement, including (i) the Closing Cash Payment and (ii) any release of
Escrow Amount (or any portion thereof) to the Sellers' Representative (for the
benefit of the Sellers) pursuant to the Escrow Agreement; 

(e) resolve any other dispute with Encore over any aspect of this Agreement,
including demanding and/or participating in arbitration proceedings with
respect to such disputes and complying with any Orders issued in connection
therewith;

(f) give and receive notices and communications that are required to be given,
or that may be given, pursuant to this Agreement;

(g) negotiate, agree to and enter into any agreement (including settlements
and releases), on behalf of the Sellers, to effectuate any of the foregoing,
which agreements shall have the effect of binding such Sellers as if such
Sellers had personally entered into such agreements; and

(h) do all other things and take all other actions under or related to this
Agreement that the Sellers' Representative may consider necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers' Representative to accomplish the
foregoing or for the accomplishment of any other action required by the terms
of this Agreement (including actions related to Taxes and Tax matters provided
for in Article 11) and to otherwise effectuate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

This appointment and power of attorney shall be deemed coupled with an
interest and all authority conferred hereby shall be irrevocable and shall not
be subject to termination by operation of law, whether by the death or
incapacity or liquidation or dissolution of any Seller or the occurrence of
any other event or events, and the Sellers' Representative may not terminate
this power of attorney with respect to any Seller or such Seller's successors
or assigns without the consent of Encore. No bond shall be required of the
Sellers' Representative, and the Sellers' Representative shall receive no
compensation for its services pursuant to this Agreement. Notices or
communications to or from the Sellers' Representative shall constitute notice
to or from each Seller.

12.2 Reliance. The Sellers' Representative may rely on and shall be protected
in relying on or refraining from acting on any instrument reasonably believed
to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
parties. The Sellers' Representative shall not be liable for other parties'
forgeries, fraud or false representations. By its, his or her execution of
this Agreement, each Seller agrees that: (i) Encore shall be able to rely
conclusively on the instructions and decisions of the Sellers' Representative
as to the determination of the Purchase Price, the settlement of any claims
for indemnification by Encore or the Company pursuant to Article 10 hereof,
the disbursement of the Escrow Amount (or any portion thereof) pursuant to the
Escrow Agreement or any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the
Sellers' Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and no
Party shall have any cause of action against Encore for any action taken by
Encore in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of the Sellers'
Representative; (ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the Sellers'
Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the Sellers and no
Seller shall have any cause of action against the Sellers' Representative for
any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Sellers'
Representative under this Agreement; (iii) the provisions of this Article 12
are independent and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest
and shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any
Seller may have in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby; (iv)
remedies available at law for any breach of the provisions of this Article 12
are 

inadequate; therefore, Encore and the Company shall be entitled to temporary
and permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages if
either Encore or the Company brings an action to enforce the provisions of
this Article 12; and (v) the provisions of this Article 12 shall be binding
upon the representatives of each Seller, and any references in this Agreement
to a Seller shall mean and include the successors to such Seller's rights
hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent
and distribution or otherwise.

12.3 Professionals; Limitation of Liability. The Sellers' Representative shall
be authorized to engage, and to rely upon the advice and opinions of, legal
counsel, accountants or other administrative or professional advisors as the
Sellers' Representative may deem advisable to carry out its duties under this
Agreement. The Sellers' Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as the Sellers' Representative while acting in good faith
and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act done or omitted
pursuant to the advice of legal counsel, accountants or other administrative
or professional advisors shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. Each
Seller agrees to hold the Sellers' Representative harmless from any loss,
damage, liability or expense (including fees and disbursements of legal
counsel, accountants and other professional advisors) that such Seller may
sustain as a result of any action taken in good faith by the Sellers'
Representative in connection with the administration of its duties under this
Agreement or in connection with any dispute arising between the Sellers and
Encore under this Agreement.

12.4 Reimbursement of Expenses; Indemnity for Losses. Each Seller hereby
agrees to reimburse the Sellers' Representative for such Seller's pro-rata
share of any out-of-pocket administrative fees, costs and expenses (including
fees and disbursements of legal counsel, accountants and other professional
advisors) reasonably incurred by the Sellers' Representative in connection
with the administration of its duties under this Agreement. Each Seller also
hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers' Representative from
and against such Seller's pro-rata share of any other loss, damage, liability
or expense (including fees and disbursements of legal counsel, accountants and
other professional advisors) that the Sellers' Representative may sustain as a
result of any action taken by the Sellers' Representative without gross
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith in connection with the
administration of its duties under this Agreement or in connection with any
dispute arising between the Sellers and Encore under this Agreement.

ARTICLE 13

MISCELLANEOUS

13.1 Public Disclosure. Encore shall have editorial and timing control over

such disclosure to the public.

13.2 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement (other than Article 10 to

under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise, by any Party without the prior written consent
of each other Party, and any such assignment without such prior written
consent shall be null and void; provided, however, that Encore may, without
the consent of any other Party, assign this Agreement to any wholly owned
subsidiary of Encore, provided that such assignee assumes the obligations of
Encore hereunder and that Encore remains liable for its obligations hereunder.

ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THIS AGREEMENT, AGREES THAT ALL CLAIMS IN
RESPECT 

OF THE ACTION OR PROCEEDING MAY BE HEARD AND DETERMINED IN ANY SUCH COURT AND
AGREES NOT TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO,
THIS AGREEMENT IN ANY OTHER COURT. EACH OF THE PARTIES WAIVES ANY DEFENSE OF
INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT
AND WAIVES ANY BOND, SURETY OR OTHER SECURITY THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED OF ANY
OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT THERETO. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT SERVICE OF SUMMONS
AND COMPLAINT OR ANY OTHER PROCESS THAT MIGHT BE SERVED IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING MAY BE MADE ON SUCH PARTY BY SENDING OR DELIVERING A COPY OF THE
PROCESS TO THE PARTY TO BE SERVED AT THE ADDRESS OF THE PARTY AND IN THE
MANNER PROVIDED FOR THE GIVING OF NOTICES IN SECTION 13.5. NOTHING IN THIS
SECTION, HOWEVER, SHALL AFFECT THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY TO SERVE LEGAL PROCESS
IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW. EACH PARTY AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT
IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING SO BROUGHT SHALL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED
BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW.

(b) WAIVER. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY
ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES, AND THEREFORE SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY
OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

(c) CERTIFICATION. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

13.9 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
each Party. No waiver by any Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach
of warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed
to extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. 

13.10 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the Parties agree that the court making the determination of
invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to reduce the scope,
duration or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a
term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision,
and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified after the expiration of
the time within which the judgment may be appealed.

13.11 Expenses. Each Party will bear its own expenses (including fees and
disbursements of legal counsel, accountants, financial advisors and other
professional advisors) incurred in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement (and each
of the other agreements and instruments contemplated by or executed in
connection with this Agreement) and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

13.12 Construction. The Parties have jointly participated in the negotiation
and drafting of this Agreement. In the event of an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumptions or burdens of proof shall
arise favoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions
of this Agreement. The Parties intend that each representation, warranty, and
covenant contained herein shall have independent significance. If any Party
has breached any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein in any
respect, the fact that there exists another representation, warranty or
covenant relating to the same subject matter (regardless of the relative
levels of specificity) that the Party has not breached shall not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty or covenant.

13.13 Incorporation of Exhibits and Schedules. The exhibits and schedules
identified in this Agreement are incorporated herein by reference and made a
part hereof.

13.14 Number and Gender. Each defined term used in this Agreement has a
comparable meaning when used in its plural or singular form. Each gender-
specific term used herein has a comparable meaning whether used in a
masculine, feminine or gender-neutral form.

13.15 Remedies. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that each other
Party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that each
other Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this
Agreement and the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any
court of the United States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the
Parties and the matter, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled, at law or in equity. 

13.16 Offset Permitted. Encore shall have the right to set off against any of
its obligations (or the obligations of any of its Affiliates) to make payment
to any Seller, under this Agreement or otherwise, any amount owed to Encore
(or to any of its Affiliates) by such Seller (or by any of its Affiliates)
under this Agreement or otherwise.

13.17 Directly or Indirectly. Where any provision in this Agreement refers to
action to be taken by any person or entity, or that such person or entity is
prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether the action
in question is taken directly or indirectly by such person or entity.

13.18 Including. As used in this Agreement, the word "including" shall be
deemed to mean "including, without limitation" and, unless otherwise expressly
provided, shall not limit the words or terms preceding such word.

13.19 Non-Business Days. If any time period for giving notice or taking action
hereunder expires on a day that is not a Business Day, the time period shall
automatically be extended to the Business Day immediately following such day.
Any reference in this Agreement to a number of days other than Business Days
shall be deemed to be reference to such number of calendar days.

13.20 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement may be
executed by facsimile, .PDF, photo or electronic signature and such facsimile,
.PDF, photo or electronic signature shall constitute an original for all
purposes.
