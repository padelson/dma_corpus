Common Stock in the Transactions are not accredited investors (as such term is used in Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act) and that the issuance of all shares of Parent Common Stock in the Transaction validly qualify for an exemption
from the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act and the equivalent state &#147;blue-sky&#148; Legal Requirements (the &#147;<B>Share Registration Exemption</B>&#148;). </P>
