-iv- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION (the "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of December 30, 2013 by and among FireEye, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Mercury Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation and
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub I"), Mercury Merger LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub II" and, together with Merger Sub I, the "Merger Subs"), Mandiant
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and
Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability
company, solely in its capacity as stockholder representative (the
"Stockholder Representative"). All capitalized terms that are used but not
defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed thereto in Annex
A.

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the boards of directors or members, as applicable, of each of Parent,
the Merger Subs and the Company have determined that it is advisable and in
the best interests of each corporation or limited liability company and their
respective stockholders or members, as applicable, that Parent acquire the
Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law, and in furtherance thereof, have approved this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Related Agreements
(the "Transactions").

WHEREAS, Parent and the Company intend, by executing this Agreement, that the
Transactions be treated as integrated steps in a single transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and will together qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this
Agreement will be, and is, adopted as a plan of reorganization within the
meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g).

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement, (i)
each Key Employee listed on Schedule A is accepting an offer letter from
Parent (collectively, the "Key Employee Offer Letter") and (ii) certain Key
Employees have executed a Non-Competition Agreement in the form set forth as
Exhibit A (a "Key Employee Non-Competition Agreement").

 

WHEREAS, concurrent with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, as a
material inducement to Parents willingness to enter into this Agreement,
each Stockholder listed on Schedule B (each, a "Major Stockholder") has
executed and delivered to Parent a Joinder Agreement in the form set forth in
Exhibit B (a "Joinder"), and a Market Stand-off Agreement in the form set
forth in Exhibit C (a "Market Stand-off Agreement").

WHEREAS, based on investor suitability questionnaires delivered prior to the
execution of this Agreement and other information made available to Parent by
the Company, Parent reasonably believes that no more than thirty-five (35) of
the recipients of Parent Common Stock in the Transactions are not accredited
investors (as such term is used in Regulation D promulgated under the
Securities Act) and that the issuance of all shares of Parent Common Stock in
the Transaction validly qualify for an exemption from the registration and
prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act and the equivalent
state "blue-sky" Legal Requirements (the "Share Registration Exemption").

 

WHEREAS, Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements, as more fully set
forth herein, in connection with the Transactions. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and other
premises set forth herein, the mutual benefits to be gained by the
performance thereof, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

THE MERGERS

_1.1 The Mergers._

 

(a) _First Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit D-1 (the "First Merger Certificate of Merger") and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law, on the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
Merger Sub I to merge with and into the Company (the "First Merger"),
whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub I shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent. The Company, as the surviving corporation after the
First Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the "First Merger Surviving
Corporation." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto shall cause the First
Merger to be consummated by filing the First Merger Certificate of Merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law. The time of the filing and acceptance
by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such other later time
as may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub I and the Company and
specified in the First Merger Certificate of Merger, shall be referred to
herein as the "First Merger Effective Time."

 

(b) _Second Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger in substantially the form attached

the applicable provisions of Delaware Law, on the Closing Date immediately
after the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the First Merger
Surviving Corporation to merge with and into Merger Sub II (the "Second
Merger" and together with the First Merger, the "Mergers"), whereupon the
separate corporate existence of the First Merger Surviving Corporation shall
cease and Merger Sub II shall continue as the surviving entity and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub II, as the surviving entity after the
Second Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the "Second Merger Surviving
Entity." Promptly after the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Second Merger to be consummated by filing the Second Merger Certificate
of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance
with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law. The time of acceptance by the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware of such filing, or such later

the certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock and the
execution and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, a Joinder Agreement and a
Market Stand-Off Agreement in the manner provided in Section 1.8, the Per

"Merger Consideration"),  _provided_ , _however_ , that a portion of the
Merger Consideration that otherwise would be payable at the Closing (x) in
Parent Common Stock to each Stockholder shall be withheld at the Closing and

("Cancelled Shares") shall be cancelled without any consideration paid
therefor.

 

(iii) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time and with respect to which
the holder thereof has properly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with
Section 262 of Delaware Law, and who has not effectively withdrawn or lost
such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to
receive the applicable consideration for Company Capital Stock set forth
in Section 1.6(b)(i) or Section 1.6(b)(iv), as applicable, but the holder
thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as are provided by Delaware Law.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.6(b)(iii), if any holder of
Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law, then,
as of the later of the First Merger Effective Time and the occurrence of
such event, such holders shares shall automatically be converted into and
represent only the right to receive, upon surrender of the certificate
representing such shares, upon the terms set forth in this Section 1.6 and
throughout this Agreement (including the indemnification and escrow
provisions set forth in Article VII), the consideration for Company Capital
Stock set forth in Section 1.6(b)(i) or Section 1.6(b)(iv), as applicable,
without interest thereon. After the Closing, Parent shall give the
Stockholder Representative (A) prompt notice of any written demand for
appraisal received by Parent and/or any of its Affiliates (including the First
Merger Surviving Corporation) pursuant to the applicable provisions of
Delaware Law and (B) the opportunity to control all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Neither Parent nor any of its
Affiliates (including the First Merger Surviving Corporation), on the one
hand, nor the Stockholders Representative, on the other hand, shall make any
payment with respect to any such demands or offer to settle or settle any such
demands without the prior written consent of the other party, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld. After the Closing, any communication to be made
by Parent and/or any of its Affiliates (including the First Merger Surviving
Corporation), on the one hand, and the Stockholders Representative, on the
other hand, to any such demanding Stockholder with respect to such demands
shall be submitted to the other party in advance and shall not be presented to

stockholders or members thereof, each share of Company Restricted Stock that
is held, as of immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, by
a Continuing Employee shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the
right to receive a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the nearest whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, each share of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section
1.6(b)(iv) shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including vesting terms, provisions providing for accelerated
vesting upon the termination from employment of a Continuing Employee after
the Closing Date, repurchase option or obligation, risk of forfeiture, and
other conditions) set forth in the applicable Plan and any other plan or
arrangement of the Company relating thereto, as in effect immediately prior to
the First Merger Effective Time. Any restricted stock award agreements and
ancillary documents between the Company and the Continuing Employee will
remain in effect and, in conjunction with the applicable Company Plan under
which the Company Restricted Stock was issued, will continue to govern the
treatment of the Parent Common Stock issuable hereunder in respect of such
Company Restricted Stock after the Closing Date (except as may be provided in
a Key Employee Offer Letter).

(B) _Company Restricted Stock Held by Non-Employee Directors._ Effective as
of the First Merger Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without

respective stockholders or members thereof, each share of Company Restricted
Stock that is held, as of immediately prior to the First Merger Effective
Time, by a Non-Employee Director shall vest in full and all restrictions,
forfeiture conditions and repurchase rights with respect thereto shall lapse,
and each such share of Company Restricted Stock shall be converted into the

and Section 1.8(b)).

(v) _Calculation of Consideration_. For purposes of calculating the aggregate
amount of cash payable and shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to each
Stockholder pursuant to Section 1.6(b)(i) and Section 1.6(b)(iv), (x) all
shares of the Company Capital Stock held by each such Stockholder shall be
aggregated on a certificate-by-certificate basis, (y) the amount of cash (if
any) to be paid to each Stockholder for each Company share certificate held by
such Stockholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole cent, and (z) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (if any) to be issued to each
Stockholder in exchange for each Company share certificate held by such
Stockholder shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number; _provided_ ,
that any Stockholder who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fraction of
a share of Parent Common Stock shall receive, in lieu thereof, an amount of
cash equal to the product obtained by _multiplying_ (A) such fraction _by_ (B)
the Parent Trading Price, rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

 



-8- (c) _Company Options_.

 

(i) _Company Options Held by Continuing Employees_. Effective as of the First

Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each Assumed Option pursuant
to this Section 1.6(c)(i) shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same
terms and conditions (including vesting terms and any acceleration provisions,
including any "double trigger" accelerated vesting that may be triggered by
the termination of a Continuing Employees employment after the Closing) set
forth in the applicable Plan and the option agreements relating thereto, as in
effect immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time, except that (A)
such Assumed Option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of the applicable Company
Option immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time _multiplied by_
the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of
Parent Common Stock and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option shall be
equal to the quotient obtained by _dividing_ the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock at which such applicable Company Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Closing Date _by_ the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to
the nearest whole cent. It is the intention of the parties that the Company
Options assumed by Parent qualify following the First Merger Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent
that such Company Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately
prior to the First Merger Effective Time.

cancellation an amount in cash, without interest, equal to (x) the excess, if
any, of (A) the Per Non-Assumed Company Option Amount _over_ (B) the per share
exercise price of such Non-Assumed Company Option _multiplied by_ (y) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Non-
Assumed Company Option. Promptly following the Closing, Parent shall pay (or
cause to be paid) the cash payable pursuant to this Section 1.6(c)(ii) in
respect of the Non-Assumed Company Options.

 

(iii) _Unvested Company Options Held by Non-Continuing Employees_. Effective
as of the First Merger Effective Time, each Unvested Company Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the First Merger Effective Time and
held by a Non-Continuing Employee shall be cancelled without the payment of
any consideration in respect of such cancelled Unvested Company Option. 

(iv) _Notices_. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Second Merger Surviving Entity to, provide written
notice to the former holders of Company Options, which notice shall be in
compliance with the terms of the Plans and each such Company Option, that the
Company Options have been treated as set forth in this Section 1.6(c) and
setting forth (A) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
Assumed Option and (B) the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of such Assumed Option.

with the SEC, within ten (10) days after the filing of any financial
statements required pursuant to Item 9.01 of Form 8-K of the SEC in connection
with the Transactions, a registration statement on Form S-8 (if available for
use by Parent), registering that number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon the
exercise of all Company Options that are assumed by Parent pursuant to Section
1.6(c) that are eligible to be registered on Form S-8, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement for so long as such assumed Company Options remain
outstanding and will reserve a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common
Stock for issuance upon exercise thereof _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder if Parent shall
fail to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.6(c)(v) at a time when
trading of Parent Common Stock has been suspended globally under Parents then
effective registration statements (it being understood and agreed that if
Parent is unable to file such registration statement on Form S-8 due to a
global trading suspension under Parents then effective registration
statements, then Parent shall file such registration statement as soon as
practicable after trading has been restored).

 

(vi) _Listing of Shares_. Promptly following the Closing, Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock being issued in
the Mergers, or that are issuable upon the exercise of Company Options that
are assumed by Parent pursuant to Section 1.6(c), to be approved for listing
(subject to notice of issuance) on NASDAQ.

 

(d) _Treatment of Company Warrants_. At the First Merger Effective Time, each
Company Warrant that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding immediately
prior to the First Merger Effective Time shall terminate in its entirety.

_1.7 Effect of Second Merger on Capital Stock of Constituent Companies._

(a) _Company Capital Stock_. Effective as of the Second Merger Effective
Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub II, the Company or the respective stockholders thereof,
each share of capital stock of the Company that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled

(iii) At the First Merger Effective Time, Parent shall transfer the

expenses pursuant to this Agreement and the ancillary agreements. The
Stockholders and Non-Employee Directors will not receive any interest or
earnings on the Representative Escrow Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Stockholder Representative any ownership right that they may otherwise
have had in any such interest or earnings. The Stockholder Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Representative Escrow Fund
other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Stockholder Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate
funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other
corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Upon deposit of the Representative
Expense Amount with the Stockholder Representative in accordance with this
Section 1.8(b)(iii), for tax purposes Parent shall be deemed to have paid
each Stockholder (other than holders of Company Restricted Stock solely in
their capacity as holders of Company Restricted Stock) and Non-Employee
Director (solely in their capacity as holders of Company Restricted Stock )
its, his or her Pro Rata Portion of the Representative Expense Amount and
then each Stockholder and Non-Employee Director shall be deemed to have
voluntarily contributed such amount to the Representative Escrow Fund.

formerly represented thereby until the holder of record of such Company
Stock Certificate shall surrender such Company Stock Certificate and validly

-12- (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Company
Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange
Agent or Parent shall pay and/or issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Merger Consideration, if any, payable and/or
issuable in respect thereto pursuant to Section 1.6(b) upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent may, in its discretion, or as required by the Exchange Agent, and as a
condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the Stockholder who is
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to either (i) deliver
a bond in such amount as it may reasonably direct or (ii) provide an
indemnification agreement in a form and substance acceptable to Parent
against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Second Merger Surviving
Entity or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(f) _Transfers of Ownership_. If any cash amounts or stock are to be disbursed
pursuant to Section 1.6 and this Section 1.8 to a Person other than the
Person whose name is reflected on the Company Stock Certificate surrendered in
exchange therefor, it will be a condition of the issuance or delivery thereof
that the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange will
have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment of any portion of the Merger Consideration
in any name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

by Parent to the Stockholders pursuant to Section 1.6(b), and this Section
1.8 shall be placed in a restrictive class bearing the following restrictive

SECURITIES LAWS. THEY MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE ABSENCE OF
AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AS TO THE SECURITIES UNDER SAID ACT AND
ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAW OR AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION
UNDER SAID ACT. THE ISSUER OF THESE SHARES MAY REQUIRE AN OPINION OF COUNSEL
REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE ISSUER THAT SUCH OFFER, SALE OR OTHER TRANSFER
OTHERWISE COMPLIES WITH THE SECURITIES ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
LAWS.

 

(h) _Exchange Agent to Return Merger Consideration_. At any time following the
last day of the sixth month following the First Merger Effective Time, Parent
shall be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to Parent or its
designated successor or assign all cash amounts that have been deposited with
the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.8(b)(i), and any and all interest
thereon or other income or proceeds thereof, not disbursed to the holders of
Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section 1.8(d), and thereafter the
holders of Company Stock Certificates shall be entitled to look only to
Parent, the First Merger Surviving Corporation and/or the Second Merger
Surviving Entity (subject to the terms of Section 1.8(j)) only as general
creditors thereof with respect to any and all cash amounts and stock that may
be payable to such holders of Company Stock Certificates pursuant to Section
1.8(d) upon the due surrender of such Company Stock Certificates and duly
executed Exchange Documents in the manner set forth in Section 1.8(d).
No interest shall be payable for the cash amounts and stock delivered to
Parent pursuant to the provisions of this Section 1.8(h) and which are
subsequently delivered to the holders of Company Stock Certificates.

 



-13- (i) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. Following
the consummation of the Mergers, the cash amounts and stock paid in respect
of the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Capital Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the records of the First Merger Surviving
Corporation or the Second Merger Surviving Entity of shares of Company Capital
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the First Merger Effective
Time. If, after the First Merger Effective Time, Company Stock Certificates
are presented to the First Merger Surviving Corporation or the Second Merger
Surviving Entity for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article I.

(j) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of Parent, the Exchange Agent, the First Merger Surviving
Corporation, the Second Merger Surviving Entity, or any party hereto shall be
liable to a Stockholder for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(k) _Statement of Expenses_. Without limitation to any other provision of
this Agreement, in making any payment in respect of any Third Party Expenses
at the Closing and in calculating the Total Cash Consideration, Parent shall
be entitled to rely on the spreadsheet attached as Annex C (the "Statement
of Expenses"), which statement sets forth the Companys statement of all paid
and unpaid Third Party Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any
Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, or anticipated to be incurred or payable by
or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary after the Closing and wire
instructions for each payment to be made at Closing.

 

 _1.9_ _Withholding Taxes_. The Company, the Exchange Agent, the Escrow Agent,

Surviving Entity, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. Tax law or under any Legal
Requirements or applicable Orders. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld and paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity or other
Person, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement
as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have
been paid.

material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. The Company
has Made Available true, correct and complete copies of its certificate of
incorporation, as amended to date (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), and

Transactions.

rights in general, and (y) rules of law governing specific performance,

equity (clauses (x) and (y) collectively, the "Enforceability Limitations").
During the six month period preceding the date of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any of the Subsidiaries has terminated, amended or waived any
rights under (or failed to enforce by seeking an injunction or by seeking to
specifically enforce the terms of) any "standstill" agreement between the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries and any other Person.

(d) The Company and the Company Board have taken all actions necessary to

consummation of the Transactions, will not result in any violation of or
default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any
material obligation or loss of any material benefit under, or result in the
imposition of any Lien upon any material assets of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of the equity securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries under, (any such event, a "Conflict") (a) any provision of the
Charter Documents or the organizational documents of any Subsidiary, as

Requirements, and were issued, transferred and repurchased (in the case of
shares that were outstanding and repurchased by the Company or any

such Company Option to comply with or be exempt from the requirements of
Section 409A).

(g) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the Company or any
Subsidiary (i) having the right to vote on any matters on which stockholders

(as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) subject to Section
409A of the Code (or any state law equivalent) and the regulations and

compensation plan, if any, has been at all times since January 1, 2005 in
operational compliance with Section 409A and at all times since January 1,
2009 in documentary compliance with Section 409A. No nonqualified deferred

which is or has been in effect at any time prior to the First Merger Effective
Time. To the extent required, the Company and each Subsidiary has properly
reported and/or withheld and remitted on amounts deferred under any Company
nonqualified deferred compensation plan subject to Section 409A. There is no
Contract to which the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates is a party,

Company, which individually or collectively could require the Company or any
of its Affiliates to pay a Tax gross up payment to, or otherwise indemnify or

provisions of this Agreement, which, individually or collectively, could give
rise to a Parent, Company, Second Merger Surviving Entity, or Subsidiary Tax

Company, Second Merger Surviving Entity or Subsidiary reporting obligations
under Section 409A.

Company makes no representation as to the amount of, or limitations on, any
net operating losses, Tax credit carry-forwards or other Tax attributes that
the Company or any Subsidiary may have following the Closing.

_2.11 Real Property_. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns any real
property, nor has the Company or any Subsidiary ever owned any real property.
Section 2.11 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all real property
currently leased, subleased or licensed by or from the Company or any
Subsidiary or otherwise occupied by the Company or any Subsidiary
(collectively, the "Leased Real Property"). Section 2.11 of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a list of all leases, lease guaranties, subleases,
agreements for the leasing, use or occupancy of, or otherwise granting a
right in or relating to the Leased Real Property, including the name of the

Property for the operation of its business. There are no other parties
occupying, or with a right to occupy, the Leased Real Property. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary owes brokerage commissions or finders fees with
respect to any such Leased Real Property or would owe any such fees if any
existing Lease Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal options
contained in such Lease Agreements. The Company and each Subsidiary has
performed all of its obligations under any termination agreements pursuant to
which it has terminated any leases, subleases, licenses or other occupancy
agreements for real property that are no longer in effect and has no
continuing liability with respect to such terminated agreements. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the Leased Real Property is in good operating
condition and repair, free from any material structural, physical and
mechanical defects, is maintained in a manner consistent with standards
generally followed with respect to similar properties, and is structurally
sufficient and otherwise suitable for the conduct of the Companys business as
currently conducted. Neither the operation of the Company or any Subsidiary on
the Leased Real Property nor, to the Companys Knowledge, such Leased Real
Property, including the improvements thereon, violate in any material respect
any applicable building code, zoning requirement or statute relating to such
Leased Real Property or operations thereon, and any such non-violation is not
dependent on so-called non-conforming use exceptions.

title to, or, in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold
interests in, all of its material tangible properties and assets, real,

any Liens, except (a) as reflected in the Current Balance Sheet, (b) Liens
for Taxes not yet due and payable, and (c) such imperfections of title and
encumbrances, if any, which do not detract from the value or interfere with
the present use of the property subject thereto or affected thereby. The
material items of equipment owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary
(i) are adequate for the conduct of the business of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as currently conducted and as currently contemplated to be
conducted, and (ii) in good operating condition, regularly and properly
maintained, subject to normal wear and tear.

classification, tax withholding and reporting, social security contributions
withholding, prohibited discrimination, working time, employee representation,

consent decree or other agreement or order with any federal, state, or local
agency or Governmental Entity with respect to employment practices. The

Affiliates current employees inside the United States are terminable at the

or amounts under other compensation plans, that were previously earned, vested
or accrued under Company Employee Plans prior to the First Merger Effective

owed to any Employee that would result from the termination by the Company,
Parent or any Subsidiary of such Employees employment or provision
of services, other than those disclosed in Section 2.15(i). To the Knowledge

works council, employee representative or other labor organization or group
of employees to organize any Employees. There are no Actions, labor disputes
or grievances pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened relating
to any labor matters involving any Employee, including charges of unfair
labor practices. To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has engaged in any unfair labor practices within the meaning of the
National Labor Relations Act or similar Legal Requirement. Neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary is presently, nor has it been in the past, a party to, or
bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, or other agreements with any
union, works council, employee representative or other labor organization or
group of employees with respect to Employees and no such agreement is being
negotiated by the Company or any Subsidiary.

as the case may be. The Company Authorizations are in full force and effect,
and no suspension or cancellation of any such Company Authorizations is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. The Company
Authorizations constitute all Company Authorizations required to permit the
Company and the Subsidiaries to operate or conduct their respective businesses
or hold any interest in their respective properties or assets and none of the

Company has been and is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the
Company Authorizations, and (ii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has

Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate pending under any of such policies or bonds
as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed. In addition,
there is no pending claim of which its total value (inclusive of defense
expenses) would reasonably be expected to exceed the policy limits. All
premiums due and payable under all such policies and bonds have been paid,
(or if installment payments are due, will be paid if incurred prior to the
Closing Date) and the Company, any Subsidiary and its ERISA Affiliates are
otherwise in material compliance with the terms of such policies and bonds
(or other policies and bonds providing substantially similar insurance
coverage). Such policies and bonds are in full force and effect. The Company

subsection or sub-clause of each representation and warranty set forth in
this Article III ( _provided, however_ , that any information set forth in a
section, subsection or sub-clause of the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed

Documents (other than in any "risk factor" disclosure or any other forward

Subs. This Agreement and any Related Agreements to which Parent and/or Merger
Sub I or Merger Sub II is a party have been duly executed and delivered by

modification or acceleration of any material obligation or loss of any
material benefit under (a) any provision of the certificate of incorporation
or bylaws (or equivalent organizational documents) of Parent or such Merger
Sub, as amended or (b) any Legal Requirement or Order applicable to Parent or

Section 5.7.

 

 _5.8 Tax Matters_. If the Company is allowed a refund or credit of Taxes for
a Pre-Closing Tax Period actually paid by the Company (or the Indemnifying
Parties) pursuant to this Agreement as a result of an overpayment of Taxes by
the Company for such Pre-Closing Tax Period, (a) such overpayment shall be
claimed as a refund (rather than as a credit) to the extent permitted under
any applicable Legal Requirement and (b) such refund shall be for the account
of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be paid over to the Escrow Agent, for
further distribution to the Indemnifying Parties (based on their Pro Rata
Portion), within thirty (30) days of receipt of such amount _, provided,_
that no such refund shall be paid until the aggregate amount of all such
refunds due to the Indemnifying Parties under this clause (b) exceeds
$100,000, in which case the Indemnifying Parties shall be entitled to only
the refunds in excess of such $100,000. Upon written request of the
Stockholder Representative, Parent shall prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed, at the Stockholder Representatives expense (on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties), amended income Tax Returns for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period in order to obtain such refunds so long as any such amendments are
consistent with applicable Legal Requirements. Neither Parent nor any
Affiliate of Parent shall file, amend, re-file or otherwise modify any Tax
Return relating in whole or in part to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period which results in the Indemnifying Parties becoming liable for
additional Taxes, without consulting the Stockholder Representative and
considering in good faith the Stockholder Representatives reasonable
comments. Parent and any Affiliate of Parent shall prepare any such Tax
Returns relating in whole or in part to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period consistent with the past practices of the Company unless otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements. Neither Parent nor any Affiliate of
Parent shall elect to waive any carryback of the Companys net operating
losses (if any) under Section 172(b)(3) of the Code on any Tax Return of the
Company filed for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or any similar provision of
local, state or non-U.S. Law), to the extent that such net operating loss is
attributable to a period ending on or before the Closing Date. For all
purposes, including with respect to the preparation of any Tax Returns,
Parent, the Company and the Stockholder Representative agree that (i)
all Transaction Deductions shall be treated as properly allocable to the
taxable period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date and
shall be included as deductions on the Tax Returns of the Company for such
period to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, and
(ii) such Tax Returns shall be prepared for a pre-Closing short year in
accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) (and
not using the "next day" rule of Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)). "Transaction Deductions" means all items of loss,
deduction or credit resulting from or attributable to (x) the repayment at or
prior to Closing of Indebtedness of the Company and the payment at or prior
to Closing of any related fees, expenses or interest, and (y) Third Party
Expenses. The Transaction Deductions described in clause (y) shall be computed
consistent with the safe harbor for treating success-based fees pursuant to
Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 I.R.B. 746 in lieu of maintaining the
documentation required by Treas. Reg. §1.263(a)-5(f).

of this Agreement;

 

(d) by Parent or the Company if any Legal Requirement shall be in effect which

Requirement that is an Order, such Order has become final and non-appealable;

 

(e) by Parent if there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company set forth
in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 1.2(b)(ii)(A)
and Section 1.2(b)(ii)(B) would not be satisfied as of the time of such breach
or inaccuracy and such breach or inaccuracy has not been cured within ten
(10) calendar days after written notice thereof to the Company; _provided,
however_ , that no cure period shall be required (i) for a breach or
inaccuracy which by its nature cannot be cured or (ii) if any of the
conditions to Closing in Section 1.2(b) for the benefit of Parent are
incapable of being satisfied on or before the End Date; or

(f) by the Company if there has been a breach of or inaccuracy in any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Parent set forth in this

as provided in Section 6.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, the Merger
Subs or the Company, or their respective officers, directors or stockholders,
if applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that each party hereto and each
Person shall remain liable for any willful and intentional breaches of this
Agreement, Related Agreements or in any certificate or other instruments
delivered pursuant to this Agreement prior to its termination; and _provided
further_ , _however_ , that, the provisions of this Section 6.2, Sections 8.6
( _Confidentiality_ ), 8.7 ( _Public Disclosure_ ), 8.8 ( _Third Party
Expenses_ ), and Article VIII ( _General Provisions_ ) shall remain in full
force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to the
terms of this Article VI.

 

ARTICLE VII

 

POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION

 

 _7.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Related Indemnification
Claims_. The representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, and the right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof
under this Agreement, shall survive until 11:59 p.m. California time on the
one year anniversary of the Closing Date (the date of expiration of
such period, the "Expiration Date"); _provided_ , _however_ , (a) the
Specified Representations shall survive until the expiration of all applicable
statutes of limitations in respect of the matters addressed by
such representations and warranties (including all periods of extension,
whether automatic or permissive), and (b) the representations and warranties
of the Company set forth in Section 2.10 ( _Tax Matters_ ) (the
"Tax Representations"), and the right to make indemnification claims in
respect thereof under this Agreement, shall survive until thirty (30) days
after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitations in respect of
the matters addressed by such representations and warranties (including all
periods of extension, whether automatic or permissive); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that all representations and warranties of the Company, and the
right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof under this Agreement,
shall survive beyond the Expiration Date or other survival periods specified
above with respect to any inaccuracy therein or breach thereof if a claim is
timely made in accordance with the terms hereunder prior to the expiration of
the survival period for such representation and warranty, in which case such
representation and warranty, and the right to make indemnification claims in
respect thereof under this Agreement, shall survive as to such claim until
such claim has been finally resolved. The representations and warranties of
Parent and the Merger Subs set forth in this Agreement, the Related Agreements
or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall terminate at the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, it is
the intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing respective survival
periods and termination dates supersede any applicable statutes of limitations
that would otherwise apply to such representations and warranties and the
right to make indemnification claims in respect thereof under this Agreement.

 

 _7.2 Indemnification._

 

(a) From and after the consummation of the First Merger, subject to the terms
and limitations of this Article VII, the Stockholders (other than holders of
Company Restricted Stock in their capacities as such) and the Non-Employee
Directors (solely in their capacity as holders of Company Restricted Stock)
(each, an "Indemnifying Party" and collectively, the "Indemnifying Parties")
shall severally (based on such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata Portion), but not
jointly, indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its affiliates (including the
Second Merger Surviving Entity) and their respective directors, officers and
other employees, (each, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties"), from and against all losses, liabilities and damages
of any kind or nature, Taxes, awards, judgments penalties, fees, costs and
expenses, including reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys and consultants fees
and expenses and any such reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses
incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or settling any
claims that are indemnifiable hereunder (hereinafter individually a "Loss" and
collectively "Losses") paid, incurred, suffered or sustained by the
Indemnified Parties, or any of them (including the Second Merger Surviving
Entity) (regardless of whether or not such Losses relate to any third party
claims), resulting from or arising out of any of the following:

 



-59- (i) any breach of or inaccuracy in, as of the date hereof or as of the
Closing, a representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this
Agreement, without giving effect to any update of or modification to the
Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been made on or after the date
of this Agreement; _provided, however,_ that in the event of any such breach
or inaccuracy, for purposes of determining the amount of any Loss relating
thereto no effect will be given to any qualifications based on the word
"material" or similar phrases (including "Company Material Adverse Effect")
contained therein (it being agreed and understood however that such
qualifications will continue to apply, as applicable, to the determination of
whether a breach or inaccuracy of representation or warranty has occurred);

 

(ii) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any inaccuracy in any information set forth in the Payment
Spreadsheet, including any failure to properly calculate Third Party Expenses,
the Total Cash Consideration, the Per Share Consideration, the Per Share Stock
Consideration, the Per Share Cash Consideration, the Per Non-Assumed Company
Option Amount or the Aggregate Strike Price Amount;

(iii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement of the Company set forth in this Agreement which is required to be
performed prior to the Closing;

(iv) any payment in respect of any Dissenting Shares in excess of the
consideration that otherwise would have been payable in respect of such shares
in accordance with this Agreement, and any other Losses paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained in respect of any Dissenting Shares, including all out-
of-pocket attorneys and consultants fees, costs and expenses and including
any such out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending against or settling any action or proceeding in
respect of Dissenting Shares;

(v) any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary (A) attributable to any taxable
period or portion thereof that ends on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-
Closing Tax Period"), including all Transaction Payroll Taxes (it being
understood that, in the case of Taxes based upon income, sales, proceeds,
profits, receipts, wages, compensation or similar items (including for the
avoidance of doubt income includible in gross income pursuant to Section 951
of the Code), the Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined on the basis of a closing of the books as of
the close of business on the Closing Date, and the amount of any other Taxes
of the Company attributable to such Tax period shall equal the amount of such
Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period up to and including the
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the
taxable period), (B) any Taxes as a result of the Company or any
Subsidiary being (or ceasing to be) (1) a member of an affiliated or combined
group pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-6 or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law on or prior to the Closing Date or
(2) a transferee or successor by contract (other than a Contract, such as a
lease, the primary purpose of which is not related to Taxes or otherwise),
which relate to an event occurring on or before the Closing Date, (C) as a
result of an express obligation arising on or prior to Closing Date to
indemnify or otherwise assume or succeed to the Taxes of any other Person, or
(D) the Stockholders share of any Transfer Taxes as set forth in Section 5.5;
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Parties shall not indemnify the
Indemnified Parties from and against: (1) any Taxes arising as a result of any
election made by Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) after the Closing, (2) any Taxes arising as a result of any
action taken by Parent or the Surviving Corporation on the Closing Date after
the Closing outside of the ordinary course of business and (3) Parents share
of any Transfer Taxes as set forth in Section 5.5; and

 



-60- (vi) any actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation on the part of the
Company or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, the Disclosure Schedules) or the Transactions.

(b) The Indemnifying Parties shall not have any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Second Merger Surviving
Entity, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to any Loss
claimed by and/or paid to an Indemnified Party pursuant to the
indemnification provisions hereof.

(c) Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification
obligations under this Article VII will be treated as adjustments to the Total
Consideration for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for
purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by applicable Legal
Requirements.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, subject to Section
7.3(b)(iv), the indemnification rights set forth in this Article VII shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties from and after the
First Merger Effective Time for any claims arising under this Agreement,
including claims of any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) this
Section 7.2(d) shall not be deemed a waiver by any party of any right to
specific performance or injunctive relief and (ii) nothing in this Agreement
shall limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party (and this Article VII shall
not be the sole and exclusive remedy in respect of such Indemnifying Party) in
connection with a claim based on actual fraud or intentional
misrepresentation committed by such Indemnifying Party.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of any party to a Related
Agreement to pursue remedies under such Related Agreement against the other
parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained herein or in any Related Agreement shall give rise to any
right on the part of any Indemnified Party, after the consummation of the
Transactions, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

 _7.3 Limitations on Indemnification_.

 

(a) _Threshold_. Except in the case of actual fraud or intentional
misrepresentation, and for breaches of or inaccuracies in the Specified
Representations or the Tax Representations, the Indemnified Parties, as a
group, may not recover any Losses (i) pursuant to an indemnification claim
under Section 7.2(a)(i) unless and until the Indemnified Parties, as a group,
shall have paid, incurred, suffered or sustained at least $3,000,000 in Losses
in the aggregate (the "Threshold Amount"), in which case the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to recover all such Losses without regard to the
Threshold Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, the limitations set forth in
this Section 7.3(a)(i) shall not apply to indemnification claims under clauses
(ii)(vi) of Section 7.2(a), inclusive and (ii) pursuant to an
indemnification claim under Section 7.2(a)(v) unless and until the Indemnified
Parties, as a group, shall have paid, incurred, suffered or sustained at least
$100,000 in Losses under Section 7.2(a)(v), in which case the Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to recover the Losses in excess of such $100,000.

 



-61- __(b) _Maximum Liability_. __

 

(i) Except in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation, and
indemnification claims for breaches of or inaccuracies in the
Specified Representations and the Tax Representations, the Indemnified
Parties sole and exclusive source of recovery for indemnification claims
under Section 7.2(a)(i) shall be recourse against the Escrow Shares held in
the Escrow Fund (with each Escrow Share being valued at the Parent Trading
Price for purposes of satisfying any such claims). For the avoidance of doubt,
the limitations set forth in this Section 7.3(b)(i) shall not apply to any
indemnification claim under clauses (ii)(vi) of Section 7.2(a), inclusive.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except in the case of
fraud or intentional misrepresentation, in no event shall the aggregate amount
of all payments made by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties in
satisfaction of any Losses resulting from or arising out of (A) breaches of
or inaccuracies in the Tax Representations and/or (B) claims for
indemnification under Section 7.2(a)(v) exceed the Escrow Amount (it being
acknowledged and agreed that any distributions made to the Indemnified Parties
from the Escrow Fund shall reduce the liability of the Indemnifying Parties
for any Losses resulting from or arising out of (A) breaches of or
inaccuracies in the Tax Representations and/or (B) claims for indemnification
under Section 7.2(a)(v) on a dollar-for-dollar basis). For the avoidance of
doubt, the limitations set forth in this Section 7.3(b)(ii) shall not apply to
any indemnification claim under clause (i) (except indemnification claims
under clause (i) of Section 7.2(a)(i) resulting from or arising out of
breaches of or inaccuracies in the Tax Representations) or clauses (ii),
(iii), (iv) or (vi) of Section 7.2(a).

 

(iii) The Indemnified Parties first source of recovery for indemnification
claims under Section 7.2(a) shall be recourse against the Escrow Shares held
in the Escrow Fund (with each Escrow Share being valued at the Parent Trading
Price for purposes of satisfying any such claims), but if the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to satisfy any portion of a Loss for which an indemnification
claim has been made under Section 7.2(a)(i) for breaches of or inaccuracies in
the Specified Representations or Tax Representations, or for which an
indemnification claim has been made under clauses (ii)(vi) of Section
7.2(a), inclusive, the Indemnified Parties shall, subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article VII, be entitled to recover such excess portion of
such Losses in respect of such indemnification claims (the portion of any
such excess Loss for which such indemnification is not satisfied by the Escrow
Fund is referred to as an "Excess Loss") directly from the Indemnifying
Parties and each Indemnifying Party shall, subject to the limitations
set forth in this Article VII, be liable, severally and not jointly, solely
for its, his or her Pro Rata Portion of the Excess Losses in respect of such
indemnification claim.

 

(iv) The liability of each Indemnifying Party for indemnification claims under
this Agreement shall be limited, in the aggregate, to a dollar amount equal
to the aggregate portion of the Total Consideration actually received by such
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement (without regard to any
withholding, vesting or other similar limitation applicable to such
payments);  _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Article VII shall
limit the liability of an Indemnifying Party to the extent such Indemnifying
Party has committed actual fraud against the Indemnified Party.

 

(c) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy under this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any
other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any other remedy based on
any such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. Other than with
respect to any claim for fraud, no Indemnified Party shall be required to show
reliance on any representation, warranty, certificate or other agreement in
order for such Indemnified Party to be entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement hereunder.

 



-62- (d) The amount of any Losses that are subject to indemnification under this
Article VII shall be calculated net of the amount of any insurance proceeds,
indemnification payments, contribution payments or reimbursements actually
received by the Indemnified Parties in respect of such Losses or any of the
events or circumstances giving rise or otherwise related to such Losses (net
of any costs or expenses incurred in obtaining such insurance,
indemnification, contribution or reimbursement, including any increases in
insurance premiums resulting from any insurance recovery),  _provided_ , that
nothing in this Section 7.3(d) shall be construed as or give rise to an
obligation to seek any such insurance, indemnification, contribution or
reimbursement. In the event that any insurance or other recovery is made by
Parent or any Affiliate of Parent with respect to any Losses for which Parent
or any such Affiliate has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to
the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be made promptly to the
Indemnifying Parties (on a pro rata basis based on each Indemnifying Partys
Pro Rata Portion of such recovery).

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
Indemnifying Party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Indemnified
Party for any exemplary or punitive damages, or any damages measures by a
multiple of earnings, incurred, suffered or sustained by an Indemnified Party
except to the extent such exemplary or punitive damages are paid to a third
party.

(f) No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to recover Losses relating to any
matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that such
Indemnified Party has recovered Losses in respect of the same such matter
under another provision of this Agreement.

 

 _7.4 Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

 

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7.1, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under this Article VII, such
Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an "Indemnification Claim
Notice") to the Stockholder Representative (with a copy to the Escrow Agent)
(or in the event an Indemnified Party elects to pursue such indemnification
claim directly against an Indemnifying Party, to such Indemnifying Party
directly) (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid, incurred, suffered
or sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or
sustain Losses, and (ii) specifying in reasonable detail the individual items
of such Losses, the date each such item was paid, incurred, suffered or
sustained, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the nature of
the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such item is
related. Parent may update an Indemnification Claim Notice from time to time
to reflect any new information discovered with respect to the claim set forth
in such Indemnification Claim Notice. Following the delivery of an
Indemnification Claim Notice, Parent shall provide the Stockholder
Representative and its representatives and agents with such documents and
records of the Second Merger Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries as they
may reasonably require, and reasonable access to such personnel or
representatives of the Second Merger Surviving Entity (including but not
limited to the individuals responsible for the matters that are subject of
the Indemnification Claim Notice) as they may reasonably require, for the
purposes of investigating or resolving any disputes or responding to any
matters or inquiries raised in the Indemnification Claim Notice.

 



-63- (b) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person (other than a
party to this Agreement) of any Action with respect to which the Indemnifying
Parties may become obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Article VII, the Stockholder Representative shall (on behalf of the
Indemnifying Parties) have the right to participate in (at the expense of the
Indemnifying Parties), but not to determine, control or conduct, the defense
of such third party Action. In the event that the Stockholder Representative
has affirmatively consented in writing to any such settlement, the
Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to object to the
recovery by Parent of the amount of such settlement pursuant to this Article
VII. In the event that the Stockholder Representative does not consent to any
such settlement, and the Indemnified Parties wish to seek indemnification
hereunder in respect of such third party Action, then the Indemnified Parties
shall make such indemnification claims pursuant to the procedures set forth
in this Article VII.

(c) If the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
shall not object in writing within the 45-day period after receipt of an
Indemnification Claim Notice by delivery of a written notice of objection
containing a reasonably detailed description of the facts and circumstances
supporting an objection to the applicable indemnification claim (an
"Indemnification Claim Objection Notice"), such failure to so object shall be
an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties (or the applicable Indemnifying Party) that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set
forth in such Indemnification Claim Notice. In such event, the Escrow Agent
shall promptly release from the Escrow Fund a number of Escrow Shares (with
each Escrow Share being valued at the Parent Trading Price for purposes of
satisfying any such claims) equal to the Losses set forth in such
Indemnification Claim Notice.

 

(d) In the event that the Stockholder Representative shall deliver an
Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with Section 7.4(c)
within 45 days after delivery of such Indemnification Claim Notice, the
Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties) and Parent
shall attempt in good faith to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholder
Representative and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and, in the case of an
indemnification claim to be recovered from the Escrow Fund, shall be
furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on
any such memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in accordance
with the terms thereof. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly
release from the Escrow Fund the number of Escrow Shares set forth in such
memorandum (it being agreed that each Escrow Share shall be valued at the
Parent Trading Price for purposes of satisfying the amount of Losses, if
any, set forth in such memorandum). Should the amount held in the Escrow
Fund, if any, be insufficient to satisfy in whole the amount owed to an
Indemnified Party in accordance with such memorandum and this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in this Article VII), then each
Indemnifying Party shall, within 10 Business Days following the date of such
memorandum, pay to the Indemnified Party such Indemnifying Partys Pro Rata
Portion of such shortfall in cash.

 

(e) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to 45 days after delivery of an Indemnification Claim Objection Notice,
either Parent or the Stockholder Representative may demand arbitration of the
matter unless the amount of the Loss that is at issue is the subject of a
pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration shall not be
commenced until such amount is ascertained or both parties agree to
arbitration, and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by one arbitrator mutually agreeable to Parent and the
Stockholder Representative. In the event that, within 30 days after
submission of any dispute to arbitration, Parent and the Stockholder
Representative cannot mutually agree on one arbitrator, then, within 15 days
after the end of such 30-day period, Parent and the
Stockholder Representative shall each select one independent arbitrator. The
two arbitrators so selected shall select a third independent arbitrator.

 



-64- (f) Any such arbitration shall be held in Santa Clara County, California,
under the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS ("JAMS").
The arbitrator(s) shall determine how all expenses relating to the arbitration
shall be paid, including the respective expenses of each party, the fees of
each arbitrator and the administrative fee of JAMS. The arbitrator or
arbitrators, as the case may be, shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing
the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrator
or majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, to discover relevant
information from the opposing parties about the subject matter of the dispute.
The arbitrator, or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be,
shall rule upon motions to compel or limit discovery and shall have the
authority to impose sanctions, including attorneys fees and costs, to the
same extent as a competent court of law or equity, should the arbitrators or
a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, determine that
discovery was sought without substantial justification or that discovery was
refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of
the arbitrator or a majority of the three arbitrators, as the case may be, as
to the validity and amount of any claim in such Indemnification Claim Notice
shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement and
the Indemnifying Parties. Such decision shall be written and shall be
supported by written findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth
the award, judgment, decree or order awarded by the arbitrator(s), and the
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on, and make distributions from the
Escrow Fund in accordance with, the terms of such award, judgment, decree or
order as applicable (it being agreed that each Escrow Share shall be valued at
the Parent Trading Price for purposes of satisfying the amount of Losses, if
any, set forth in such award, judgment, decree or order as applicable _)_.
Within 30 days of a decision of the arbitrator(s) requiring payment by Parent
to the Indemnifying Parties or by the Indemnifying Parties to Parent, such
person(s) shall make the payment to such other person(s), including any
distributions out of the Escrow Fund, as applicable. Judgment upon any award
rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
The forgoing arbitration provision shall apply to any dispute among the
Indemnifying Parties or any Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties
under this Article VII, whether relating to claims to recover funds from the
Escrow Fund or to the other indemnification obligations set forth in this
Article VII.

_7.5 Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement, and the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Mergers by the Stockholders,
each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed to have agreed to appoint
Shareholder Representative Services LLC as its agent and attorney-in-fact, as
the Stockholder Representative for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
to give and receive notices and communications in respect of indemnification
claims under this Agreement, to authorize payment to any Indemnified Party
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of any indemnification claims hereunder
by any Indemnified Party, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate,
enter into settlements and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply
with orders of courts and awards of arbitrators with respect to any such
indemnification claims, to assert, negotiate, enter into settlements and
compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and
awards of arbitrators with respect to, any such indemnification claim by any
Indemnified Party hereunder against any Indemnifying Party or by any such
Indemnifying Party against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any
Indemnified Party and any such Indemnifying Party, in each case relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions, and to take all other actions that are
either (i) necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholder
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically
mandated or permitted by the terms of this Agreement. Such agency may be
changed by the Stockholders from time to time upon not less than 30 days
prior written notice to Parent; _provided, however_ , that the Stockholder
Representative may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds interest of
the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of the substituted
agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a resignation of the
Stockholder Representative or other vacancy in the position of Stockholder
Representative, such vacancy may be filled by the holders of a majority in
interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Stockholder
Representative. After the Closing, notices or communications to or from the
Stockholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from
the Indemnifying Parties; _provided,_ for the avoidance of doubt, it is
hereby clarified that the Stockholder Representative shall have no authority
to receive notification or agree to settlement or liability with respect to
claims made pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(vi) directly against an Indemnifying
Party.

 



-65- (b) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as Stockholder Representative while acting in good faith
and without gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnifying Parties
shall indemnify the Stockholder Representative and hold the Stockholder
Representative harmless against any and all Losses arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Stockholder
Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses
of any legal counsel retained by the Stockholder Representative and any
amounts required to be paid by the Stockholder Representative to the Escrow
Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement ("Stockholder Representative
Expenses"), in each case, as such Stockholder Representative Expense is
incurred or suffered _._ The Representative Expense Amount shall be available
to pay directly, or reimburse the Stockholder Representative for, any
Stockholder Representative Expenses. Following the Expiration Date, the
Stockholder Representative shall have the right to recover Stockholder
Representative Expenses not previously recovered from the Representative
Escrow Fund from the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the Indemnifying
Parties (provided that such funds would otherwise be released to the
Indemnifying Parties and are no longer subject to any pending indemnification
claims), and prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent
a certificate setting forth the Stockholder Representative Expenses actually
incurred and not previously recovered. For the avoidance of doubt, while this
section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the
Representative Escrow Fund and the Escrow Fund, this Section 7.5(b) shall not
limit the obligation of any Indemnifying Party to promptly pay such
Stockholder Representative Expenses as they are incurred, nor does it prevent
the Stockholder Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at
law or otherwise. In no event will the Stockholder Representative be required
to advance its own funds on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties or otherwise.
The Indemnifying Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities
in this Section 7.5(b) will survive the resignation or removal of the
Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement
(notwithstanding Section 6.2). Following the Expiration Date, the resolution
of all indemnification claims made under this Agreement and the satisfaction
of all such indemnification claims, the Stockholder Representative shall
distribute such portion of the Representative Expense Amount that has not been
used to reimburse the Stockholder Representative for Stockholder
Representative Expenses, if any, to the Escrow Agent, who will promptly
distribute such funds to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Portions. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholder Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.2 or Section 8.3, shall constitute a
decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final, conclusive and
binding upon the Indemnifying Parties; and the Escrow Agent and Parent may
rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder
Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow Agent and Parent are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholder Representative.

 

(c) Notwithstanding that the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
represented by Cooley LLP (the "Firm") in the preparation, negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the Related Agreements (collectively, the
"Transaction Agreements"), each of Parent and the Company agrees that after
the Closing the Firm may represent the Stockholder Representative, the
Indemnifying Parties and/or their Affiliates in all matters related to the
Transaction Agreements, including without limitation in respect of any
indemnification claims pursuant to the Transaction Agreements. Each of Parent
and the Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
that it has had an opportunity to ask for and has obtained information
relevant to such representation, including disclosure of the reasonably
foreseeable adverse consequences of such representation, and it hereby waives
any conflict arising out of such future representation.

 



-66- (d) Each of Parent and the Company hereby acknowledges, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, that the Firm has represented the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements. Such parties agree that any attorney-client privilege,
attorney work-product protection and expectation of client confidence
belonging to the Company and related to the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Agreements, and all information and documents covered by such
privilege or protection shall, after the Closing, belong to, be deemed the
right of, and be controlled solely by the Indemnifying Parties and may only
be waived by the Stockholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying
Parties. To the extent that Parent or the Company receives or takes physical
possession of any privileged or protected material covered by this Section
7.5(d) after the Closing, such physical possession or receipt shall not, in
any way, be deemed a waiver by the Indemnifying Parties of the privileges or
protections described in this Section 7.5.

ARTICLE VIII

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

 _8.1 Certain Interpretations_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Annex, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Annex, Schedule
or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is
made in this Agreement to an Article or a Section, such reference shall be to
an Article or a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
words "include," "includes" and "including" when used herein shall be deemed
in each case to be followed by the words "without limitation." All references
in this Agreement to "$" or dollars shall mean U.S. denominated dollars. The
table of contents and headings set forth in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by
counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction
providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be
construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. The Company
shall be responsible for compliance with this Agreement by its officers,
directors, employees and other agents (in their capacities as such). No prior
draft of this Agreement, any Related Agreement nor any course of performance
or course of dealing shall be used in the interpretation or construction of
this Agreement. No parole evidence shall be introduced in the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement unless the ambiguity or uncertainty in issue
is plainly discernible from a reading of this Agreement without consideration
of any extrinsic evidence. Although the same or similar subject matters may be
addressed in different provisions of this Agreement, the parties intend that,
except as reasonably apparent on the face of the Agreement or as expressly
provided in this Agreement, each such provision shall be read separately, be
given independent significance and not be construed as limiting any other
provision of this Agreement (whether or not more general or more specific in
scope, substance or content).

_8.2 Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by Parent and the Stockholder
Representative (and, prior to the First Merger Effective Time, the Company) at
any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the
party against whom enforcement is sought, _provided_ , that no amendment to
be effected after the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval and which
requires stockholder approval under Delaware Law shall be effective until the
receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval with respect to such amendment.
For purposes of this Section 8.2, subject to the proviso in the prior
sentence, the Stockholders are deemed to have agreed that any amendment of
this Agreement signed by the Stockholder Representative shall be binding upon
and effective against the Stockholders whether or not they have signed such
amendment.

 



-67- _8.3 Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Parent, on the one hand, and
the Company, on the other hand, may, to the extent permitted under any
applicable Legal Requirements, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties made to such party set forth herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of
the covenants, agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party set
forth herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. For purposes of this Section 8.3, the
Stockholders are deemed to have agreed that any extension or waiver signed by
the Company shall be binding upon and effective against all Stockholders
whether or not they have signed such extension or waiver.

 

 _8.4 Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise, except that Parent may assign its rights and delegate its
obligations hereunder to its Affiliates as long as Parent remains ultimately
liable for all of Parents obligations hereunder.

negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the effectuation of the
Transactions, shall be governed by the terms of the Mutual Non-
Disclosure Agreement effective as of October 25, 2013 (the "Confidential
Disclosure Agreement"), between the Company and Parent. In this regard, the
Company acknowledges that the Parent Common Stock is publicly traded and that
certain information obtained during the course of its due diligence could be
considered to be material non-public information within the meaning of federal
and state securities laws. Accordingly, the Company acknowledges and agrees
not to engage in any discussions, correspondence or transactions in the
Parent Common Stock in violation of applicable securities laws. The
Stockholder Representative acknowledges and agrees that it will continue to be
bound by the terms and conditions of that certain Nondisclosure Agreement,
dated as of December 5, 2013, by and between the Stockholder Representative
and the Company, which is intended to cover all information disclosed to the
Stockholder Representative in connection with this Agreement and the
effectuation of the Transactions and which shall survive the Closing.

_8.7 Public Disclosure_. Except as required by Legal Requirements and other
than with respect to information that is publicly disclosed, or approved for
public disclosure, by Parent, neither the Company nor any of its
Representatives shall issue any statement or communication to any third
party (other than its agents that are bound by confidentiality restrictions)
regarding the subject matter of this Agreement or the Transactions, including,
if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons therefor,
without the consent of Parent.

_8.8 Third Party Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
each party shall be responsible for its own expenses and costs that it incurs
with respect to the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the Related Agreements; _provided_ , _however_ , that all Third
Party Expenses that are incurred by the Company or any Subsidiary shall be
deducted from the Total Cash Consideration payable hereunder in respect of the
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the adjustments
contemplated by the definition of Total Cash Consideration.

 

 _8.9 Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, Annex A hereto, the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the Related Agreements, and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
referenced herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, and are not intended to confer upon any other
person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 



-69- _8.10 No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in this Agreement, except
for Section 5.7, is intended to, or shall be construed to, confer upon any
other person any rights or remedies hereunder.

 

 _8.11 Specific Performance and Other Remedies_.

 

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the other party or parties hereto, any Stockholder or
the Stockholder Representative of any covenant, obligation or other agreement
set forth in this Agreement, (i) each party shall be entitled, without any
proof of actual damages (and in addition to any other remedy that may
be available to it), to a decree or order of specific performance or mandamus
to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant, obligation or
other agreement and an injunction preventing or restraining such breach or
threatened breach, and (ii) no party hereto shall be required to provide or
post any bond or other security or collateral in connection with any such
decree, order or injunction or in connection with any related action or legal
proceeding.

 

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred herein upon a party hereto
shall, subject in all respects to the limitations set forth in Article VII
(including Section 7.2(d)), be deemed to be cumulative with, and not exclusive
of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or in equity upon such party,
and the exercise by a party hereto of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of the provisions set forth in this Agreement, including the provisions set
forth in Article VII, shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this Agreement
of any right or remedy which such party may have at law or in equity based on
any other Persons fraudulent acts or omissions or intentional
misrepresentation, nor will any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit
(i) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for actual
fraud or intentional misrepresentation, (ii) the time period during which a
claim for actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation may be brought or
(iii) the recourse which any such party may seek against another Person with
respect to a claim for actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

_8.12 Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or
the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

_8.13 Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof.

 

 _8.14 Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Subject to Sections 7.4(e) and 7.4(f), each of
the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of the state courts of the State of Delaware in connection with any
matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement and the Transactions or any
other matters contemplated herein (or, only if the state courts of the State
of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
federal court within the State of Delaware). Subject to Sections 7.4(e) and
7.4(f), each party agrees not to commence any legal proceedings related
hereto except in such state courts of the State of Delaware (or, only if the
state courts of the State of Delaware decline to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, in any federal court within the State of Delaware).
By execution and delivery of this Agreement, subject to Sections 7.4(e) and
7.4(f), each party hereto and the Stockholders irrevocably and unconditionally
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and to the
appellate courts therefrom solely for the purposes of disputes arising under
the this Agreement and not as a general submission to such jurisdiction or
with respect to any other dispute, matter or claim whatsoever. The parties
hereto and the Stockholders irrevocably consent to the service of process out
of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the
delivery of copies thereof by overnight courier to the address for such party
to which notices are deliverable hereunder. Any such service of process shall
be effective upon delivery. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve
process in any other manner permitted by applicable law. The parties hereto
and the Stockholders hereby waive any right to stay or dismiss any action or
proceeding under or in connection with this Agreement brought before the
foregoing courts on the basis of (i) any claim that it is not personally
subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any reason, or that
it or any of its property is immune from the above-described legal process,
(ii) that such action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that
venue for the action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may not
be enforced in or by such courts, or (iii) any other defense that would
hinder or delay the levy, execution or collection of any amount to which any
party hereto is entitled pursuant to any final judgment of any court having
jurisdiction.

 



-70- _8.15 Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

_8.16 Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a fully executed
Agreement (in counterparts or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF
format or by facsimile shall be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement.
