Stockholders' Representative are each sometimes referred to herein
individually as a "Party" and together as the "Parties".

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "Merger"), whereby, among other
things, (i) each issued and outstanding share of Company Capital Stock (other

to receive the consideration set forth herein; and (ii) all other securities
of the Company shall be terminated;

WHEREAS, the Company shall (i) within 24 hours after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, deliver to Parent a written consent from (a) the
holders of a majority of the outstanding Company Capital Stock (on an as-
converted to Company Common Stock basis) entitled to vote on the adoption of
this Agreement on the record date chosen for purposes of determining the
stockholders of the Company entitled to vote on the approval of this Agreement
pursuant to the Company's Governing Documents; and (b) the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock (voting on an
as-converted basis as a single class) (the Company Stockholders described in
clauses (a) and (b), the "Requisite Stockholders"), in each case adopting this
Agreement in accordance with the Act and the relevant provisions of the
Company's Governing Documents in substantially the form set forth in Exhibit A
attached hereto (such consent set forth in this clause (i), the "Written
Consent"); and (ii) comply with the notice requirements of Sections 228 and
262 of the Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after delivery to Parent

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement,

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Parent entering into this Agreement,
certain Persons, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, are entering into a restrictive covenant agreement (the

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as
follows:

 ARTICLE I

MERGER; CLOSING; MERGER CONSIDERATION

Section 1.1 The Merger.

(a)Surviving Company. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation law of the
State of Delaware, as amended (the "Act"), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue its corporate existence under
Delaware law as the surviving company in the Merger (the "Surviving Company").

(b)Effective Time; Effects of the Merger. On the Closing Date, the Company and
Merger Sub will file the Certificate of Merger with the Office of the
Secretary of State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective at such time
as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Office of the
Secretary of State of Delaware, or at such later date or time as is agreed by
Merger Sub and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger (the
"Effective Time"). From and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have
the effects specified in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of the Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in
the Surviving Company following the Merger, and all debts, liabilities,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the
Surviving Company following the Merger, subject to the terms and conditions
contained in this Agreement.

(c)Closing of the Merger. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted under applicable Laws) of each of the conditions contained in
ARTICLE VII hereof (other than conditions that by their nature are customarily
satisfied at the Closing or that can be satisfied by their terms only at the
Closing), and except as otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the
Company, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place no later
than the third Business Day after satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted under applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VII
hereof (other than conditions that by their nature are customarily satisfied
at the Closing or that can be satisfied by their terms only at the Closing).
In lieu of an in-person Closing, the Closing may instead be accomplished by
facsimile or email (in PDF format) transmission to the respective offices of
legal counsel for the Parties of the requisite documents, duly executed where
required, delivered upon actual confirmed receipt, with originals to be
delivered as promptly as practicable following the Closing. The actual date on
which the Closing takes place is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing
Date", and the Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time
on the Closing Date. All proceedings to be taken and all documents to be
executed and delivered by all parties at the Closing will be deemed to have
been taken and executed simultaneously and no proceedings will be deemed to
have been taken nor documents executed or delivered until all have been taken,
executed and delivered.

(d)Governing Documents; Directors; Officers.

(i)At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Surviving
Company shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical to the
certificate of incorporation of the Merger Sub until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(ii)At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Company until

to serve in accordance with the Governing Documents of the Surviving Company.
The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be

accordance with the Governing Documents of the Surviving Company.

Section 1.2 Paying Agent; Payment Fund; Closing Certificates.

(a)No more than seven Business Days, and no fewer than three Business Days,
prior to the anticipated Effective Time, the Company shall prepare and deliver
to Parent a schedule (the "Disbursement Schedule") in the form attached as
Exhibit C, which schedule shall be dated as of the Closing Date and shall set
forth all of the following information (in addition to the other required data
and information specified therein), as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (it being understood and agreed that in the event that Parent notifies
the Company prior to the Closing that it disputes any of the amounts set forth
therein, then Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to resolve
any such dispute as promptly as practicable, and modify the Disbursement
Schedule as appropriate to reflect any agreed adjustments thereto, provided,
that such cooperation shall not delay the Closing, it being understood and
agreed that if Parent and the Company have not resolved any such dispute as of
the Closing Date, then the amounts proposed by the Company so remaining in
dispute shall (subject to any adjustments to which Parent and the Company have
agreed in writing) prevail for purposes of the Disbursement Schedule): (i) the
names of all the Company Stockholders as of the Closing and their respective
addresses (if available) and email addresses as and to the extent reflected in
the records of the Company; (ii) the number, class and series of shares of
Company Capital Stock (with Certificate numbers) held by such Persons as of
the Closing; (iii) the amount of cash payable to each Company Stockholder
pursuant to Section 1.3(a) (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section
1.4(f), Section 1.5 and Section 1.8, as applicable); (iv) the calculation of
each Company Stockholder's Pro Rata Share; (v) the amount of cash payable to
each holder of Warrants or Options pursuant to Section 1.3(a)(i) -(ii), (vi)
the amount of Transaction Expenses (as set forth in the Transaction Expenses
Certificate) payable to each payee thereof; (vii) the amount of Funded Debt
(as set forth in the Funded Debt Payoff Certificate) payable to each payee
thereof; (viii) a schedule of the payees and accounts to which each of the
foregoing payments will be made; and (ix) a separate column that indicates
whether each Company Stockholder will be paid by the Paying Agent or through
Company payroll.

(b)No more than seven Business Days, and no fewer than three Business Days,
prior to the anticipated Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to Parent
(i) (A) a certificate (the "Funded Debt Payoff Certificate"), certified by a
duly authorized officer of the Company, setting forth the Company's good faith
estimate of all outstanding Funded Debt as of immediately prior to the
Closing, including the respective amounts with respect to each such item of
Funded Debt, and (B) the forms of pay-off letters in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent to be executed at or prior to the Closing by
providers of Funded Debt, which, if such Funded Debt is secured, shall include
an undertaking by such providers to discharge, terminate and release in full
at Closing any Encumbrance securing such Funded Debt (such letters, the
"Payoff Letters"); and (ii) a certificate (the "Transaction Expenses
Certificate") setting forth the Company's good faith estimate of all
Transaction Expenses that will be unpaid as of the Closing Date. Concurrent
with the delivery of the Funded Debt Payoff Certificate, the Company shall
have made arrangements satisfactory to Parent for the full and final release,
by each lender of Funded Debt, of all Encumbrances over the properties and
assets of the Company and its subsidiaries.

(c)Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative
shall engage the Paying Agent, pursuant to a paying agent agreement in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, the Stockholders' Representative and the
Paying Agent (the "Paying Agent Agreement"), for payment of the portion of the
Payment Fund then due to the holders of Company Capital Stock pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and the Disbursement Schedule. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, to be
further distributed to the holders of the Company Capital Stock in an account
specified by the Paying Agent to Parent (with such account so specified prior
to the Closing Date), cash in an amount equal to the Closing Payment less the
Closing Option and Warrant Consideration. All funds provided to the Paying
Agent by Parent pursuant to the terms hereof are referred to herein as the
"Payment Fund".

(d)Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments
thereof) that remains undistributed to the former holders of Company Capital
Stock one year after the end of the Earnout Period shall be delivered by the
Paying Agent to the Surviving Company upon demand. Any former holders of
Company Capital Stock who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE I
shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Company for payment of
the portion of the Payment Fund payable with respect thereto.

(e)Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, none of
Parent, the Surviving Company, the Paying Agent, nor any Party hereto, shall
be liable to any Person for any amount properly paid from the Payment Fund or
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.

(f)The Paying Agent shall hold, invest and release the Payment Fund in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement.

Section 1.3 Conversion of Shares; Closing Deliveries.

(a)At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Stockholders'
Representative, the Paying Agent or any Company Stockholder:

(i)each then-outstanding and unexercised warrant to purchase Company Common
Stock (each, a "Warrant") and each then-outstanding and unexercised option to
purchase Company Common Stock granted under the Company's 2012 Equity
Incentive Plan (the "Company Equity Plan" and each such option, an "Option"),
shall vest in full and, without any action on the part of any holder of any
such Warrant or Option, shall automatically be canceled and converted into the
right to receive from the Company an amount of cash, if any, equal to the
product of the sum of (A) and (B), where (A) is the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock then underlying such Warrant or Option multiplied by the
excess, if any, of the Closing Payment Common Stock Per Share Amount over the
exercise price per share of such Warrant or Option (such amount, in the
aggregate, the "Closing Option and Warrant Consideration"), and (B) is when,
as and if an Earnout Amount becomes payable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement under Section 1.5, the applicable per share portion of such Earnout
Amount with respect to a share of Company Common Stock for each share of
Company Common Stock underlying such Warrant or Option as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time. In the event that the exercise price of any Warrant or
Option is equal to or greater than the amount calculated pursuant to the
foregoing sentence, such Warrant or Option shall be cancelled, without any
consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or
effect. As of the Effective Time, each holder of a Warrant or Option shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
payment, if any, described herein;

(ii)each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares, Excluded Shares,
and shares that have been converted to Company Common Stock in accordance with
the Company's Governing Documents as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the Liquidation Preference of each
such share of Company Preferred Stock;

(iii)each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, including any such share of Company Common Stock
issued under the Company Equity Plan, which shall vest in full at the
Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares and Excluded Shares), shall be
automatically converted into the right to receive (A) an amount of cash
(without interest) equal to the Closing Payment Common Stock Per Share Amount
plus (B) when, as and if an Earnout Amount becomes payable pursuant to the

applicable, are delivered, at least two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, then Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent to pay such dollar amount to
such holder by wire transfer of immediately available funds on the Closing
Date. Each such Certificate so surrendered (or deemed surrendered) shall be
cancelled. Until surrendered (or deemed surrendered) as contemplated by this
Section 1.3(f), each such Certificate shall be deemed after the Effective Time
to represent only the right to receive (following such surrender or deemed
surrender) the consideration receivable pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and Section
1.5 with respect to the shares of Company Capital Stock previously represented
by such Certificate.

 (h)If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.3(f), upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and the presentation of such affidavit (and
delivery of a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and IRS Forms

following the execution and delivery of this Agreement (and in no event more
than 10 Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date), to mail or
otherwise deliver a Letter of Transmittal and IRS Form W-8 (or instructions to
access and complete such form) and IRS Form W-9 to each holder of record of
shares of Company Capital Stock. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the
cash amount payable upon the surrender (or deemed surrender) of any
Certificate for the benefit of the holder of such Certificate. If the payment
equal to the applicable cash amount is to be made to a Person other than the
Person in whose name a surrendered (or deemed surrendered) Certificate
formerly evidencing shares of Company Capital Stock is registered on the stock
transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered (or so deemed surrendered) shall be endorsed
properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment of the applicable cash amount to a Person
other than the registered holder of such Certificate, or shall have
established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Taxes either have been
paid or are not applicable.

(j)Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if
required by the Act, but only to the extent required thereby, Dissenting
Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive the consideration
described in Section 1.3(a) and Section 1.5, and holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall only be entitled to receive such rights as are provided in
accordance with the Act and any other applicable Law unless and until such
holders fail to perfect or withdraw or otherwise lose such rights under the
Act and any other applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time, any such
holder of Dissenting Shares fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
otherwise loses such right, such holder's Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be
automatically treated as if they had been converted into and have become
exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
consideration described in Section 1.3(a) and Section 1.5, without any
interest thereon (subject to the surrender of the Certificate(s) representing
such Dissenting Shares and other requirements set forth in Section 1.3(f)).
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands for dissenters'
rights and withdrawals of demands for dissenters' rights. Parent shall have
the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
dissenters' rights or settle or offer to settle any such demand.

Estimated Closing Adjustment (the "Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement"),

that if Parent and the Company have not resolved any such dispute as of the

shall (subject to any adjustments to which Parent and the Company have agreed
in writing) prevail for purposes of the Estimated Closing Adjustment
Statement. The amounts included in the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement
shall be calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles. The
Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement shall include a detailed listing of the
items and amounts included in the calculation of the Estimated Closing
Adjustment, including the Closing Net Working Capital used to calculate the
Working Capital Adjustment, and shall be prepared by the Company in good faith
and in accordance with this Agreement and the books and records of the Company
and the subsidiaries, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of the Company
stating that the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement was prepared in accordance with this Section 1.4(b)(i), and that the calculations included
therein were made in accordance with the applicable definitions included
herein and the Accounting Principles.



(ii)Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Parent will prepare and deliver to

Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail Parent's calculation of the
Closing Adjustment, which shall include a detailed listing of the items and
amounts included in the calculation of each of the items included in the

Company and the subsidiaries, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of an
officer of Parent stating that the Preliminary Statement was prepared in
accordance with this Section 1.4(b)(ii), and that the calculations included
therein were made in accordance with the definitions included herein and the
Accounting Principles. The Preliminary Statement as finally modified pursuant
to clauses (b) through (d) of this Section 1.4 to become the final statement
of the Closing Adjustment is referred to herein as the "Final Statement." All
disputes with respect to the Preliminary Statement and the Final Statement
will be resolved in accordance with clauses (b) through (d) of this Section

(iii)If the Company or any of its subsidiaries takes a physical inventory at

Parent and its representatives, the results of any such physical inventory to
reflect transactions (including transactions such as sales of goods and
services, purchases of raw materials and the conversion of inventory into
accounts receivable) after the date of such inventory or inventories, as the
case may be, through and including the day immediately prior to the Closing
Date. Such physical inventory or inventories shall include the valuation
determinations in respect of the inventory covered thereby and such
inventories (including the related valuations) shall be used for the purpose
of determining the inventory amounts for the Closing Net Working Capital. If
the Company and its subsidiaries do not take the foregoing physical
inventories within such timeframe and Parent or its representatives elect to
take such inventories on or after the Closing Date for the purpose of
preparing the Preliminary Statement and the determination of the Closing Net
Working Capital, Parent shall notify the Stockholders' Representative of the
taking of such inventory at least five Business Days prior to the taking of
such inventory and afford the Stockholders' Representative the right to
observe the taking of each such physical inventory. If Parent or its
representatives take such inventories on or after the Closing Date, Parent or
its representatives shall adjust, in consultation with the Stockholders'
Representative, the results of any such physical inventory such that
transactions (including transactions such as sales of goods and services,
purchases of raw materials and the conversion of inventory into accounts
receivable) after the Closing are not reflected in the inventories. The
valuation of the inventory or inventories shall be calculated using the
Accounting Principles for any inventories taken by either the Company or
Parent for the purposes of determining the Closing Net Working Capital. 

(c)Review of Preliminary Statement.

and its subsidiaries, including the working papers of Parent's independent
accountants (subject to the execution of customary working paper access
letters), if any.

Escrow Agent a written letter of its disagreement with the Preliminary

Parent's delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the Stockholders'
Representative, the Preliminary Statement will become the Final Statement on
the 31st day following Parent's delivery of the Preliminary Statement to the
Stockholders' Representative. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in
reasonable detail any proposed adjustment to the Preliminary Statement and the
basis for such adjustment (including a specific dollar amount and accompanied
by a reasonably detailed explanation).



(iii)If the Notice of Disagreement is delivered in accordance with Section
1.4(c)(ii), then (A) any amount set forth in the Preliminary Statement as to
which the Stockholders' Representative has not objected in the Notice of
Disagreement in accordance with Section 1.4(c)(ii) will be deemed to be
accepted and will become part of the Final Statement, and (B) the Final
Statement will become conclusive and binding on the earlier of (1) the date
that the Stockholders' Representative and Parent resolve in writing all
remaining disputed matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (2) the
date that the Independent Accounting Firm delivers to the Stockholders'
Representative and Parent a copy of the Final Statement and the Closing
Adjustment pursuant to Section 1.4(e)(iv).



(d)Meeting to Resolve Proposed Adjustments. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in no event later than 15 days, after the Stockholders' Representative's
delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative will meet and endeavor to resolve the unaccepted adjustments in
the Notice of Disagreement. If Parent and the Stockholders' Representative
reach agreement in writing on such adjustments, the Final Statement will be
the Preliminary Statement modified to reflect the adjustments accepted
pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(iii)(A) and those otherwise agreed to in writing by
the Parties pursuant to this Section 1.4(d).

(e)Resolution by Arbitration.

(i)If Parent and the Stockholders' Representative do not resolve to their
mutual satisfaction all disputed adjustments in the Notice of Disagreement
within 15 days following the meeting provided for in Section 1.4(d), any
remaining disputed adjustments that were included in the Notice of
Disagreement will be settled by Grant Thornton LLP (or, if such accounting
firm shall decline to act or is not, at the time of submission thereto,
independent of Parent or the Company, to another independent accounting firm
of national reputation mutually acceptable to Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative) (either Grant Thornton LLP or such other accounting firm being
the "Independent Accounting Firm") in accordance with the following provisions
of this Section 1.4(e). Neither Parent nor the Company (A) has, in the three-year period prior to the date of this
Agreement, engaged the Independent Accounting Firm to perform any services in
excess of $100,000 in any 12-month period for any such Person (other than
acting as an independent arbitrator in a similar capacity as the Independent
Accounting Firm) or (B) will engage the Independent Accounting Firm to perform
any service for such Person (other than acting as an independent arbitrator in
a similar capacity as the Independent Accounting Firm) prior to the
finalization of the Final Statement pursuant to this Section 1.4.



(ii)As soon as reasonably practicable following the engagement of the
Independent Accounting Firm, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative will
furnish the Independent Accounting Firm with a copy of this Agreement, the
Financial Statements, the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement, the
Preliminary Statement, the Notice of Disagreement and any other relevant
correspondence between the Parties. Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative will also give the Independent Accounting Firm:

1)position papers outlining such Party's respective arguments and supporting
documentation for such Party's position, provided, however, that Parent's
positions, arguments and computations must not be inconsistent with those set
forth in the Preliminary Statement or agreed to with the Stockholders'
Representative pursuant to Section 1.4(d) above (and the Independent
Accounting Firm will not consider any that are inconsistent), and the
Stockholders' Representative's positions, arguments and computations must not
be inconsistent with those set forth in the Notice of Disagreement or agreed
to with Parent pursuant to Section 1.4(d) above (and the Independent
Accounting Firm will not consider any that are inconsistent); and

2)access to the books and records of the Surviving Company and its
subsidiaries, including any work papers or other schedules prepared by such
Party's accountants (subject to compliance with such Party's accountants'
customary procedures for release) relating to the preparation of the
Preliminary Statement and the Notice of Disagreement, and upon reasonable
advance notice, access during normal business hours to relevant personnel of
Parent and the Surviving Company.



(iii)The Independent Accounting Firm's engagement will be limited to (A)
reviewing the Preliminary Statement and the amounts placed in dispute by the
Notice of Disagreement pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(ii); (B) determining the
amount for each individual item remaining in dispute between the Stockholders'
Representative and Parent in accordance with the Accounting Principles and
this Agreement, and (2) whether there were mathematical errors in the
Preliminary Statement; (C) preparing the Final Statement, which will include
those amounts in the Preliminary Statement accepted by the Stockholders'
Representative pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(iii)(A), those adjustments otherwise
agreed to in writing by Parent and the Stockholders' Representative pursuant
to Section 1.4(d), and those amounts determined by the Independent Accounting
Firm in accordance with the foregoing clause (B) (which shall not be more
favorable to Parent than the amount specified in the Preliminary Statement nor
more favorable to the Stockholders' Representative than the amount specified
in the Notice of Disagreement); and (D) calculating the Closing Adjustment.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the
Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders) and
Parent in inverse proportion as they may prevail on matters resolved by the
Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be
determined by the Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of the Independent Accounting Firm is rendered on the Final
Statement and the Closing Adjustment.

(iv)The Parties will instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to (A) complete
its preparation of the Final Statement and the Closing Adjustment within 25
days from the date of submission of the disputed adjustments to the
Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to Section 1.4(e)(ii), and (B) deliver
promptly thereafter a copy of the Final Statement and the Closing Adjustment
to the Stockholders' Representative, Parent and the Escrow Agent, together
with a report setting forth each disputed adjustment and the Independent
Accounting Firm's determination with respect thereto. The Independent
Accounting Firm's determination will be conclusive and binding upon the
Parties and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

(v)The Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed that, between the time
the Stockholders' Representative delivered the Notice of Disagreement to
Parent and the date of the Independent Accounting Firm's engagement, the
Stockholders' Representative and Parent may have exchanged certain proposals
relating to the disputed items that were intended solely for purposes of
facilitating settlement discussions and such proposals were confidential and
were provided solely on the condition and understanding that such proposals
would not be permitted to be disclosed in any court or arbitration hearing,
including with respect to the accounting firm engagement in the dispute. The
Independent Accounting Firm will be instructed to disregard any evidence of
such settlement proposals and negotiations in its consideration of the
disputed matter.

(f)Payment of Closing Adjustment.

(i)If the Closing Adjustment finally determined in accordance with this
Section 1.4 is greater than the Estimated Closing Adjustment:

1)Parent will pay, or cause to be paid, to the Paying Agent, for further
distribution to the Company Equityholders (as defined herein) pursuant to the
terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, an amount in cash equal to such excess
within three Business Days from the date on which the Preliminary Statement
becomes the Final Statement; and

2)Parent and the Stockholders' Representative will instruct the Escrow Agent
to pay from the Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to
the Company Equityholders pursuant to the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement,
within three Business Days from the date on which the Preliminary Statement
becomes the Final Statement; and (ii)If the Estimated Closing Adjustment is greater than the Closing Adjustment
finally determined in accordance with this Section 1.4:

1)Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to pay to Parent from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the excess of the
Estimated Closing Adjustment over the Closing Adjustment ("Parent's Aggregate
Closing Adjustment Payment"), and to make such payment (1) within three
Business Days following the date on which the Preliminary Statement becomes
the Final Statement and (2) in immediately available funds by wire transfer
pursuant to instructions provided in writing by Parent; provided, however,
that, in no event shall Parent's Aggregate Closing Adjustment Payment exceed
the Escrow Amount; and

2)in the event that the Parent's Aggregate Closing Adjustment Payment is less
than the Escrow Amount, Parent and the Stockholders' Representative will
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the remainder of the Escrow Fund to the
Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Company Equityholders pursuant
to the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, within three Business Days from
the date on which the Preliminary Statement becomes the Final Statement.

(iii)Any portion of the Escrow Fund payable with respect to former holders of
Options or Warrants shall be paid to the Company or the Surviving Company for
further payment to such former holders (1) through the Company's or the
Surviving Company's payroll (and net of applicable withholding) no later than
the first regular payroll date following such release from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with the terms hereof, with respect to any Options or Warrants
granted to the holder in the holder's capacity as, or had vesting tied to the
holder's performance of services as, an employee of the Company for applicable
employment Tax purposes or (2) through the Company's or the Surviving
Company's accounts payable with respect to all other former holders of Options
or Warrants.

(iv)If the Estimated Closing Adjustment finally determined in accordance with
this Section 1.4 is equal to the Closing Adjustment, then there will be no
adjustment to the Closing Payment pursuant to this Section 1.4 and Parent and
the Stockholders' Representative will instruct the Escrow Agent to pay the
full Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent, for further distribution to the Company
Equityholders pursuant to the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement, within
three Business Days from the date on which the Preliminary Statement becomes
the Final Statement;



(v)For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Agreement, a smaller
negative integer (i.e., closer to zero) is always "greater than" a larger
negative integer (i.e., further from zero). For example, -2 is greater than
-10.

Section 1.5 Earnout.

(a)As used herein, "EBITDA" shall mean, for any applicable period, the
following amount: (A) the net income of the Surviving Company and its
subsidiaries during the applicable period, plus (B) to the extent deducted in
determining net income during the applicable period: interest expense;
federal, state and local income taxes; depreciation of tangible assets; and
amortization of intangible assets. The components of EBITDA shall be
determined in accordance with the Accounting Principles as consistently
applied by the Company in the preparation of the audited Financial Statements
for the 2019 fiscal year and, to the extent consistent with the Accounting
Principles, using the same accounting principles, practices, procedures,
policies and methods, with consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions,
exclusions and valuation and estimation methodologies that were employed in
the preparation of the sample EBITDA calculation attached hereto as Exhibit F (the "Sample
EBITDA Calculation"). Without limiting the foregoing, for purposes of
calculating the 2020 EBITDA, there shall be no deductions for any general and
administrative expenses (GandA), IRandD expenses or any overhead related charges
of Parent or its affiliates (other than the Surviving Company) or any other
indirect costs allocations from Parent or its affiliates (other than the
Surviving Company) after the Closing.

(b)As used herein, "Revenue" shall mean revenue generated by Parent, the
Surviving Company and their respective subsidiaries, without duplication, from
(i) sales through direct sales channels of products, whether Poppin-branded or
not, including unbranded or third-party products such as Byrne electric
solutions or Humanscale monitor arms, and services arising out of or related
to direct sales (e.g., white glove installation, storage or customization
fees), but excluding non-Poppin branded, designed, sourced or produced
products sold by (A) Kimball Hospitality, Inc., an Indiana corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, (B) Parent's Hospitality business unit, or
(C) business units or Persons acquired by Parent after the date hereof, (ii)
sales through two-step distribution channels of Poppin-branded products or

deliver to the Stockholders' Representative a statement (the "First Earnout
Statement") showing (A) the Revenue for the months of May and June 2021 (only
to the extent following the Closing Date if the Closing occurs during such
months) and (B) EBITDA with respect to the period from January 1, 2021 (or the
Closing Date, if the Closing Date is later than January 1, 2021) through June
30, 2021 (such period from the Closing through June 30, 2021, the "First
Earnout Period"), calculated in a manner consistent with the definitions
thereof. If the Stockholders' Representative does not provide a reasonably
detailed written notice (an "Earnout Statement Dispute Notice") with respect
to certain disputed items (or calculations) as specified in the notice (the
"Earnout Disputed Items") to Parent within 45 calendar days of receiving the
First Earnout Statement, then the Parties hereby agree that the First Earnout
Statement shall be deemed conclusive and binding on the Parties hereto.

(ii)If the Stockholders' Representative provides an Earnout Statement Dispute
Notice to Parent within such 45-day period, Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the
dispute during the 15-day period commencing on the date Parent receives the
Earnout Statement Dispute Notice from the Stockholders' Representative. If the
Stockholders' Representative and Parent do not agree upon a final resolution
with respect to any disputed items within such 15-day period, then the
remaining items in dispute shall be submitted promptly to the Independent
Accounting Firm for determination in accordance with the procedures, and the
fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne by the
Stockholders' Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders) and
Parent in accordance with the rules, set forth in Section 1.4(e), mutatis
mutandis. The conclusive and binding First Earnout Statement, based either
upon agreement of Parent and the Stockholders' Representative, or the written
determination delivered by the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with
Section 1.4(e) and this Section 1.5, shall be deemed the "Final First Earnout
Statement". (iii)(A) If the Revenue set forth on the Final First Earnout Statement is
equal to or greater than $10,100,000; and (B) if the EBITDA set forth on the
Final First Earnout Statement is equal to or greater than negative $2,800,000

for further distribution to each Company Equityholder pursuant to the terms of
the Paying Agent Agreement, an amount equal to $5,000,000; provided, that, for
the purposes of the First Earnout Statement only, the Revenue set forth
therein shall exclude any Revenue from sales by Poppin attributable to its
wholesale business unit (as determined in the same manner in which sales were
historically allocated by the Company to its wholesale business unit). Any
amounts payable pursuant to this Section 1.5(c)(iii) (the "First Earnout
Payment") shall be made within ten Business Days following the date on which
the First Earnout Statement becomes the Final First Earnout Statement.;
provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.5(c), no First Earnout Payment will be made if the Closing has not occurred
by the end of the First Earnout Period. For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if the
Revenue set forth on the Final First Earnout Statement is less than
$10,100,000, or (y) if the EBITDA set forth on the Final First Earnout
Statement is less than negative $2,800,000 (i.e., a negative integer larger

1.5(c)(iii) (the "Second Earnout Payment") shall be made within ten Business
Days following the date on which the Second Earnout Statement becomes the

Earnout Statement, then the Parties hereby agree that the Third Earnout
Statement shall be deemed conclusive and binding on the Parties hereto.

to time upon the reasonable written request of the Stockholders'
Representative, and upon reasonable notice, Parent shall, and shall cause its
affiliates (including the Surviving Company) to, provide the Stockholders'
Representative and its representatives with reasonable access, in a manner not
disruptive to the operations of the business of Parent and its affiliates
(including the Surviving Company), during normal business hours to such of the
books and records and personnel of the Parent and its affiliates (including
the Surviving Company) as may be reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy
of the information delivered by Parent pursuant to this Section 1.5 and
whether any of the Earnout Amounts are payable; provided, that Parent shall
not be required to provide such access more than four times in any 12-month
period.

(m)Parent shall have the right to withhold and set-off against any amount
otherwise due to be paid pursuant to this Section 1.5 (i) the amount of any

Options or Warrants shall be paid to the Company or the Surviving Company for
further payment to such former holders (1) through the Company's or the
Surviving Company's payroll (and net of applicable withholding) no later than

portion of the Earnout Amount, with respect to any Options or Warrants granted
to the holder in the holder's capacity as, or had vesting tied to the holder's
performance of services as, an employee of the Company for applicable
employment Tax purposes or (2) through the Company's or the Surviving
Company's accounts payable with respect to all other former holders of Options
and Warrants. Section 1.6 Withholding. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Company
and its subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or, as
applicable, cause to be deducted and withheld) from any and all payments made
under this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld under applicable Laws. To the extent such amounts are withheld and
paid to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
to whom such amounts would have otherwise been paid.

agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company Disclosure Schedule. The powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Stockholders'
Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled with an interest and shall be
irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of
any Company Equityholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and
(ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any Company Equityholder
of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the Escrow Fund.
All actions taken by the Stockholders' Representative under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement or the Stockholders' Representative Engagement Agreement
shall be binding upon each Company Equityholder and such Company
Equityholder's successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by
such Company Equityholder, and all defenses which may be available to any
Company Equityholder to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the
Stockholders' Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Stockholders' Representative Engagement Agreement are

(b)Parent shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Stockholders'

whatsoever, upon any consent, approval or action of the Stockholders'
Representative as the consent, approval or action, as the case may be, of each
Company Equityholder individually and all Company Equityholders as a group in
all matters referred to herein, and each confirms all that the Stockholders'
Representative shall do or cause to be done by virtue of its appointment as
the Stockholders' Representative. The Stockholders' Representative shall be
entitled to: (i) rely upon the Disbursement Schedule, (ii) rely upon any
signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a
signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf of the applicable Company
Equityholder or other party. (c)Certain Company Equityholders have entered into an engagement agreement
(the "Stockholders' Representative Engagement Agreement") with the
Stockholders' Representative to provide direction to the Stockholders'
Representative in connection with its services under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Stockholders' Representative Engagement Agreement
(such Company Equityholder, including their individual representatives,
collectively hereinafter referred to as the "Advisory Group"). Neither the
Stockholders' Representative nor its members, managers, directors, officers,
contractors, agents and employees nor any member of the Advisory Group
(collectively, the "Stockholders' Representative Group"), shall be liable to
any Company Equityholder for any action or failure to act in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Stockholders' Representative's
responsibilities hereunder, under the Escrow Agreement or under the
Stockholders' Representative Engagement Agreement, unless and only to the
extent such action or failure to act constitutes gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Each Company Equityholder hereby consents and agrees to all
actions or inactions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders'
Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Stockholders'
Representative Engagement Agreement and hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and
hold harmless the Stockholders' Representative Group from and against all
damages, Losses, Liabilities, charges, penalties, costs, claims, fees,
judgments and expenses (including court costs and legal fees and expenses,
costs of other skilled professionals and in connection with seeking recovery
from insurers) (collectively, the "Stockholders' Representative Expenses")
incurred in any Proceeding between any such Person or Persons and the Company
Equityholders (or any of them) or between any such Person or Persons and any
third party or otherwise incurred or suffered as a result of or arising out of
such actions or inactions of the Stockholders' Representative under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the Stockholders' Representative Engagement
Agreement (except for actions or inactions resulting from the willful
malfeasance or gross negligence of the Stockholders' Representative). The
Stockholders' Representative shall have the right to retain legal counsel and
other advisors and to incur such fees as the Stockholders' Representative
deems reasonable and necessary in the exercise of its responsibilities
hereunder and to seek payment or reimbursement from the Company Stockholders
for such fees and expenses, including solely with respect to the internal
relationship among the Stockholders' Representative and the Company
Equityholders setting off such fees and expenses against amounts otherwise
payable to the Company Equityholders at the time such amounts are distributed.
The Company Equityholders acknowledge that the Stockholders' Representative
shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any
financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers,
rights, duties or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the
Stockholders' Representative shall not be required to take any action unless
the Stockholders' Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in its determination, are sufficient to protect the
Stockholders' Representative against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
may be incurred by the Stockholders' Representative in performing such
actions.

(d)The Stockholders' Representative may resign upon 90 days prior written
notice thereof (the "Resignation Notice") to Parent and each Company
Stockholder; provided that a successor Stockholders' Representative shall have
been duly appointed pursuant to this Section 1.7(d) prior to the retiring
Stockholders' Representative's resignation. Upon receipt of the Resignation
Notice, a majority of Company Stockholders (based on their respective Pro Rata
Share) shall appoint a successor Stockholders' Representative. If no successor
Stockholders' Representative shall have been appointed by the Company
Stockholders and shall have accepted such appointment, within 60 days after
delivery of the Resignation Notice, then the Stockholders' Representative
wishing to resign shall, on behalf of the Company Stockholders, appoint a
successor Stockholders' Representative, which shall be any Company
Equityholder. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as the Stockholders'
Representative hereunder by a successor Stockholders' Representative, such successor Stockholders'
Representative shall succeed to and become vested, effective no earlier than
90 days after delivery of the Resignation Notice, with all the rights and
duties of the retiring Stockholders' Representative, and the retiring
Stockholders' Representative shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. After the retiring Stockholders' Representative's
resignation hereunder as the Stockholders' Representative, the provisions of
this Agreement shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was the Stockholders' Representative. The
immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the resignation or
removal of the Stockholders' Representative or any member of the Advisory
Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

Section 1.8 Holdback. The Stockholders' Representative shall require that a
portion of the consideration to be received by the Company Stockholders in an
aggregate amount equal to the Holdback Amount be paid to and held by the
Stockholders' Representative on behalf of the Company Equityholders pursuant
to Section 1.3(c)(v) and used to satisfy potential future obligations of such
Company Equityholders under this Agreement, the Stockholders' Representative
Engagement Agreement and the Related Agreements and to pay any Stockholders'
Representative Expenses incurred by the Stockholders' Representative in
connection with acting as the Stockholders' Representative pursuant to the
Representative Agreements or the Stockholders' Representative Engagement
Agreements. The Stockholders' Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no responsibility or
liability for any loss of principal of the Holdback Amount other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholders'
Representative is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity
in connection with the Holdback Amount, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. The Company Equityholders will not receive any
interest on the Holdback Amount and assign to the Stockholders' Representative
any such interest. Subject to Advisory Group approval, the Stockholders'
Representative may contribute funds to the Holdback Amount from any
consideration otherwise distributable to the Company Equityholders. The
Holdback Amount shall be retained by the Stockholders' Representative for such
time as the Stockholders' Representative shall determine in its reasonable
discretion. Any remaining amounts distributed from the Holdback Amount shall
be delivered to the Paying Agent, and then distributed to each Company
Equityholder in an amount equal to such Company Equityholder's Pro Rata Share
of such remaining Holdback Amount by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by such Company Equityholder to the
Stockholders' Representative. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
Holdback Amount shall be treated as having been received and voluntarily set
aside by the Company Equityholders on the Closing Date. Any amounts required
to be withheld with respect to the deemed payment to a Company Equityholder of
its portion of the Holdback Amount shall reduce the amount of cash otherwise
payable to such Company Equityholder at Closing and shall not reduce the
Holdback Amount.

operations of the Company prior to Closing. Prior to the Closing, each of
Parent and the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and

operations.

Section 4.2 Consent. Prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company shall use
Reasonable Efforts to make or cause to be made promptly all material

consideration, expense, fee or other payment or make any other concession to
any third party from whom consent, waiver or approval is required or requested
from or by such third party in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby in order to obtain any such consent, waiver
or approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
including this Section 4.2, the parties hereto each acknowledge and agree that
delivering notices and obtaining waivers, consents, approvals and
authorizations from any third parties as contemplated in this Section 4.2 will
not be a condition to the obligation of the Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Section 4.3 Implementing Agreement; Further Assurances.

action required to fulfill its obligations hereunder and shall otherwise use
Reasonable Efforts to facilitate the consummation of the transactions

take all such other action as any Party may reasonably request from time to
time, before or after Closing and without payment of further consideration, in
order to effectuate the transactions provided for in this Agreement and the

to, on the one hand, and the Company shall, or shall cause its subsidiaries
to, on the other hand, make any and all filings which are required under the
HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall furnish to Parent, and
Parent shall, and shall cause Merger Sub to, furnish to the Company, such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is
necessary under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law. The Company shall
promptly inform Parent, and Parent shall promptly inform the Company, as to
any material communications with, and any inquiries or requests for additional
information from, the United States Federal Trade Commission and the United
States Department of Justice; to the extent practicable, Parent and the
Company shall each permit the Company or Parent (as the case may be) to review
in advance and consider in good faith the other Party's reasonable comments in
any communication given by it to any Governmental Entity, and, to the extent
there are any meetings or substantive telephone or video calls with any
Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall each permit the other to
attend such meetings or calls unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity;
provided that materials required to be provided pursuant to this Section 4.4
may be restricted to outside counsel and may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address legal
privilege concerns. Each Party shall use its respective Reasonable Efforts to
comply as promptly as possible with any such inquiry or request. Each Party
hereby covenants and agrees to use Reasonable Efforts to secure termination of
any waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law, to obtain
the approval of any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and to resolve such objections, if any, as
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
require Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective affiliates to (a) agree
to sell, divest, dispose of or hold separate any assets or businesses, or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that could limit its freedom of
action with respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of its
businesses, product lines or assets, or (b) litigate, pursue or defend against
any administrative or judicial action or proceeding (including any proceeding
seeking a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction) challenging
any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law.
Parent and the Company shall each be responsible for 50% of the filing fees
payable under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that the Company's liability for 50% of the fees as described in the
foregoing sentence shall be included as an accrued liability in the Final
Statement for purposes of determining Closing Net Working Capital to the
extent that the Company has not paid such fees prior to the Closing. (b)Prior to the Closing Date, no Party hereto shall take any action that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect or materially delay the approval of
any Governmental Entity, or the expiration or termination of any waiting
period under Antitrust Laws, including by agreeing to merge with or acquire
any other person or acquire a substantial portion of the assets of or equity
in any other person that competes with the Company. The Parties further
covenant and agree, with respect to a threatened or pending preliminary or
permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or statute, rule,
regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the ability of the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated herein, to use Reasonable
Efforts to prevent or lift the entry, enactment or promulgation thereof, as
the case may be.

Section 4.6 Parent's Inspection Rights; Data Room DVD.

(a)Upon reasonable notice, the Company shall give to Parent and its designated
employees or representatives reasonable access during regular business hours
of the Company to all facilities, properties, assets, books, documents,
Commitments, Tax Returns, Personnel and records of the Company and its
subsidiaries, and shall furnish promptly to Parent and its representatives any
information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries as Parent may
reasonably request; provided, however, that such access does not unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall not be required to disclose any
information to Parent, Merger Sub or their respective representatives, to the
extent doing so would (A) violate any applicable Law to which the Company is
subject, (B) result in the waiver of the attorney-client privilege or similar
legal privilege or attorney work product protection of the Company with
respect to such information, or (C) require the disclosure of communications
regarding the identity of other Persons that, prior to the date of this
Agreement, expressed an interest in acquiring the Company and the terms of
such proposals, in each case during the sale process resulting in this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Closing Date, Parent shall and shall cause its affiliates (including the
Surviving Company) to use Reasonable Efforts to preserve and keep all books
and records of the Company in its or their possession as applicable, in
compliance with the bona fide records retention policies of Parent; provided,
however, that Parent or its affiliates (as applicable) may destroy or permit
to be destroyed any such books and records prior to the seventh anniversary of
the Closing Date if, prior to doing so, Parent so advises the Stockholders'
Representative in writing and gives the Stockholders' Representative a
reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof. Subject to the foregoing
proviso, from and after the Closing Date until the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date, upon reasonable advance notice and subject to any procedures or
restrictions determined by Parent in good faith to be appropriate to ensure
compliance with any applicable Law or confidentiality obligation, or in order
to preserve the attorney-client privilege or similar legal privilege or
attorney work product protection, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to
furnish to the Stockholders' Representative (at the Company Equityholders'
sole expense) copies of such documents and records of, and other information
regarding, the Company as the Stockholders' Representative may reasonably
request to the extent such records, documents and other information are
required by the Company Stockholders in order to comply with applicable Law,
subpoena or other valid legal process.

following the Closing a Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) or comparable medium
reasonably acceptable to Parent that contains a true and complete electronic
copy of the Data Room. Section 4.7 Public Announcements. No Party shall make, or shall permit any of
its affiliates or representatives to make, any public announcement of the
transactions provided for in or contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
Related Agreements unless the form and substance of the announcement are
mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Stockholders' Representative, which
agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (but
after having received such approval, a Party may thereafter disclose freely
any information contained in such approved release or public statement without
any need for further approval), or unless public disclosure is necessary to
comply with Laws or the rules of any applicable stock exchange. The Parties
hereby agree that, as of the Closing, the Mutual Confidential Information
Agreement, dated August 7, 2020, by and between Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement") shall be terminated in its entirety and shall be
without further force and effect, and no party thereto (nor any of their
respective successors in interest) shall have any further rights, duties,
liabilities or obligations of any nature whatsoever with respect to, in
connection with or otherwise arising under the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 4.8 Employee Benefit Plans. For a period of one year following the
Closing Date, Parent shall provide employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries with employee benefits that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to those provided by the Company and its subsidiaries under their

provided, however, that for purposes of this Section 4.8, such employee
benefits to be provided by Parent (a) shall include only benefits provided
under plans that are (i) welfare benefit plans described under Section 3(1) of
ERISA, or (ii) retirement plans that are described in Section 3(2) of ERISA
and intended to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of the

be expected to result in a material default under such Lease or the
termination of such Lease, (iii) amend, supplement or otherwise modify any

maintain the existing insurance policies for all Leased Real Property in full
force and effect. Section 4.11 No Solicitation. From the date hereof through the Closing, the
Company shall not, nor will any affiliate of the Company or any Personnel of
the Company or any of its affiliates, and the Company will cause any
investment banker or other representative retained by the Company or any of
its affiliates not to (a) directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage or participate in any way (including by way of furnishing
information) in any discussion or negotiations with any Person or other entity
or group (other than Parent or an affiliate of Parent) concerning any merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, sale of Equity Securities, recapitalization,
restructuring, reorganization or any other similar transaction or business
combination relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, an

considering an Acquisition Proposal any confidential information concerning
the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or (c) enter into any understanding,
agreement or commitment with any third party concerning any merger,

transaction relating to the Company or any of its subsidiaries. As promptly as
practicable after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any request for
nonpublic information or inquiry that the Company reasonably believes would
lead to an Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide Parent with written
notice of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal,
request or inquiry, and the identity of the Person or group making any such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

(a)The Company will furnish Parent with management-prepared financial
statements for the Company and its subsidiaries, as prepared in the ordinary
course of business by management of the Company on a monthly basis, for each

available, and in any event, not later than 20 days after the end of each
applicable month.

(b)If the Closing has not occurred on or prior to February 15, 2021, the
Company will, no later than April 1, 2021, furnish Parent with an audited
consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries as of December

financial statements (i) on a basis consistent with the Historical Financial
Statements and (ii) in compliance with the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 2.4(b) with respect to the Historical Financial Statements.

Section 4.13 Termination of Related Party Arrangements. Prior to the Closing,
the Company shall terminate, settle or extinguish all Intercompany Liabilities
(including all Company Notes), other than those listed in Section 4.13 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, such that immediately prior to the Closing there
will be no Intercompany Liabilities outstanding and none of the Company
Stockholders, their affiliates, the Company or its subsidiaries shall have any
further rights or obligations of any kind in respect thereof, other than (a)
pursuant to the Commitments and arrangements set forth in Section 4.13 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule and (b) this Agreement and the Related Agreements.
Any such termination, settlement or extinguishment of any Company Notes shall
be treated as compensation for services for U.S. income tax purposes. Any
amounts required to be withheld with respect to the deemed payment of a
Company Note Payor resulting from termination, settlement or extinguishment of
Company Notes issued to a Company Note Payor shall reduce the amount of cash
otherwise payable at Closing to such Company Note Payor for the shares of
Company Capital Stock held by such Company Note Payor. Section 4.14 Section 280G Matters. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall (a) use its Reasonable Efforts to obtain from each Person who is, with
respect to the Company, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code) as determined under Section 280G of the Code (each,
a "Disqualified Individual"), and who otherwise would receive any "parachute
payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code), a waiver of such
Disqualified Individual's rights to all such payments and/or benefits
applicable to such Disqualified Individuals (such waived payments, the "Waived
Parachute Payments") solely to the extent required to avoid imposition of any
excise Taxes by operation of Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Code and, in
substitution therefor, the right to receive such payments only if approved by
equityholders of the Company in a manner that complies with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, (b) promptly deliver to Parent copies of all
executed waivers so obtained, and (c) submit to the Company's equityholders
for approval by such number of equityholders, in a manner that meets the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (the "280G Approval"), the
Waived Parachute Payments such that, following the 280G Approval, such
payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be "parachute payments" under
Section 280G of the Code. The Company shall provide Parent with (i) copies of
all documents prepared pursuant to this Section 4.14, (ii) a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such documents before such documents are
finalized, which comments the Company shall consider in good faith
incorporating into such documents, and (iii) the results of the vote of
equityholders described in this Section 4.14. All costs and expenses of
obtaining the waivers and soliciting the vote under this Section 4.14 shall be
paid by the Company prior to the Closing Date or included as a Transaction
Expense. Prior to soliciting the 280G Approval, Parent shall provide in
writing to the Company the relevant details of all payments, benefits and
arrangements, if any, to be entered into with or otherwise provided to any
Disqualified Individual by Parent or any affiliate or subsidiary of Parent, in
each case, that could reasonably be expected to be taken into account in
determining whether any payments and benefits constitute "parachute payment"
pursuant to Section 280G of the Code with respect to any such Person in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.15 RandW Policy. Parent has caused the RandW Binder in the form made
available to the Company prior to the date of this Agreement to be issued by
the RandW Insurer effective as of the date hereof and will not amend any
material term of the RandW Binder or the RandW Insurance Policy (before or after
Closing) in any respect that would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the Company Stockholders hereunder or otherwise without the
prior written consent of the Stockholders' Representative.

Section 4.16 Tail Insurance.

(a)From and for a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Parent
shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its subsidiaries not to,
amend, repeal or modify any provision in the Governing Documents of the
Surviving Company and its subsidiaries relating to the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses of any individuals who served as a
director, manager or officer of any member of the Company (or any predecessor-
in-interest thereof) at any time prior to the Closing (each, a "DandO
Indemnified Person") in a manner that would reasonably be expected to affect
materially and adversely affect the right of any DandO Indemnified Person to be
indemnified, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
Governing Documents of the Company, or as otherwise agreed by contract with
such DandO Indemnified Person as they existed prior to the Closing and set forth
on the Company Disclosure Schedule, against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and expenses of investigation,
defense and ongoing monitoring), judgments, penalties, fines, losses, charges,
demands, actions, suits, proceedings, settlements, assessments, deficiencies,
Taxes, interest, obligations, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in
settlement incurred in connection with any claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring
at or prior to the Closing to the extent relating to the fact that the DandO
Indemnified Person was a manager or officer of the Company, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Closing.

(b)Prior to, but effective as of, the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain
at its expense a prepaid six-year non-cancellable run-off insurance policy
with respect to the Company's existing directors' and officers' liability
insurance coverage (collectively the "Run-Off Policies"), in each case
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company, to provide insurance
coverage for events, acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing for all
Company DandO Indemnified Persons and which shall have a scope substantially
similar to the existing coverage under, and have other terms not less
favorable to the insured persons than the terms of, the directors' and
officers' liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company.
The Run-Off Policies shall cover the Company and its subsidiaries for any
claims made before, on or after the Closing Date with respect to any events or
claims occurring or arising prior to or on the Closing Date, the cost of which
shall be borne by the Company and, to the extent not paid prior to the Closing
Date, included as a Transaction Expense. Parent shall not, and shall cause the
Surviving Company not to, take any action to eliminate such Run-Off Policies.

(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations
under this Section 4.16 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner
as to adversely affect any Parent Indemnified Party to whom this Section 4.16
applies without the consent of such affected Parent Indemnified Party, it
being understood and agreed that the Parent Indemnified Parties are intended
to have rights of enforcement under this Agreement.

Section 4.17 Stockholder Approval. As promptly as practicable after the date
hereof, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby from all
of the Company Stockholders. The Company shall ensure that the Company
Stockholders, prior to approval of this Agreement by such Company
Stockholders, shall have received from the Company all material information
necessary to make an informed decision with respect thereto.

Consent to Parent within 24 hours after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and (ii) comply with the notice requirements of Sections 228 and

of the Written Consent (it being understood that the information statement and
notice of appraisal rights delivered pursuant to such Sections shall be in a
form reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company).

Section 4.19 PPP Escrow.

(a)PPP Loan Forgiveness. On October 8, 2020, the Company submitted an
application for forgiveness of the PPP Loan to Silicon Valley Bank. Following
the Closing and until the PPP Escrow Expiration Date, Parent shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Company to (i) use their respective Reasonable
Efforts to obtain forgiveness for the outstanding principal amount under the
PPP Loan as promptly as practicable after the Closing, including by submitting
on a timely and complete basis any documents related to the discharge of the
PPP Loan that may be requested by Silicon Valley Bank or the SBA and (ii)
reasonably cooperate in the event of any audit or inspection by a Governmental
Entity in connection with the application for forgiveness of the PPP Loan.
Following the Closing and until the PPP Escrow Expiration Date, Parent shall,
and Parent shall cause its subsidiaries (including the Surviving Company) to,
(i) comply with the terms of the PPP Loan and (ii) not take any action that
could reasonably be expected to result in non-forgiveness of the PPP Loan or a
determination of the Company's ineligibility for the PPP Loan. (b)Distribution of the PPP Escrow Fund. On or prior to the date that is five
(5) Business Days after the PPP Escrow Expiration Date, Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative shall deliver to the PPP Escrow Agent a joint
written instruction to release the PPP Escrow Fund as follows:

(i)In the event of a final determination that the PPP Loan will be forgiven in
whole pursuant to Section 1106 of the CARES Act, then Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative shall deliver to the PPP Escrow Agent a joint
written instruction to release from the PPP Escrow Fund all then-remaining
amounts in the PPP Escrow Fund to the Paying Agent for further payment to the
Company Equityholders pursuant to the terms of the Paying Agent Agreement; or

(ii)In the event that (A) a final determination is made that the PPP Loan
either will be forgiven in part or will not be forgiven pursuant to Section
1106 of the CARES Act or (B) no final determination is made whether the PPP
Loan will be forgiven, then Parent and the Stockholders' Representative shall
deliver to the PPP Escrow Agent a joint written instruction to release from
the PPP Escrow Fund (x) such unforgiven amount, together with interest accrued
thereon through the PPP Escrow Expiration Date (the "PPP Loan Repayment
Amount"), to the PPP Escrow Agent as consideration for the repayment of such
amounts (for the avoidance of doubt, only up to the amount of cash then
remaining in the PPP Escrow Fund) and (y) following the release of the PPP
Loan Repayment Amount pursuant to the foregoing clause (x), all then-remaining
amounts in the PPP Escrow Fund (if any) to the Paying Agent for further
payment to the Company Equityholders pursuant to the terms of the Paying Agent
Agreement.

(iii)Any portion of the PPP Escrow Fund payable with respect to former holders
of Options or Warrants shall be paid to the Company or the Surviving Company
for further payment to such former holders (1) through the Company's or the
Surviving Company's payroll (and net of applicable withholding) no later than
the first regular payroll date following any such release from the PPP Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms hereof, with respect to any Options or
Warrants granted to the holder in the holder's capacity as, or had vesting
tied to the holder's performance of services as, an employee of the Company
for applicable employment Tax purposes or (2) through the Company's or the
Surviving Company's accounts payable with respect to all other former holders
of Options and Warrants.

Section 4.20 Resignations of Directors and Officers. Prior to Closing, the
Company shall use its Reasonable Efforts to cause each of the directors and
officers of the Company and its subsidiaries (except to the extent otherwise
requested by Parent) to provide written resignations, effective as of the
Closing Date, from all directorships and offices with the Company and its
subsidiaries, respectively.



ARTICLE V

TAXES

Section 5.1 Filing Responsibility. From and after the Closing Date, Parent
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, timely prepare and file all Tax
Returns of the Company and its subsidiaries attributable to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period. For any such Tax Return of the Company and its subsidiaries,
Parent shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, (i) prepare and file timely
the Tax Return in accordance with the most recent past practice of such entity
(except as otherwise required by applicable Law), (ii) if such Tax Return is
an income or other material Tax Return, deliver a draft of such Tax Return to
the Stockholders' Representative, for the Stockholders' Representative's
review, a reasonable period of time before the due date (after giving effect
to any applicable extensions of time for filing) so that the Stockholders'
Representative has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on such
draft, and (iii) negotiate in good faith with the Stockholders' Representative
with respect to any comment provided in writing by the Stockholders'
Representative to Parent with respect to such Tax Return. If the Stockholders' Representative consents to such Tax Returns (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall, or shall
cause its Affiliates to, execute and file such Tax Returns as prepared by
Parent. In the event of any disagreement between Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative regarding any Tax Return relating to any Pre-Closing Period
that cannot be resolved by the tenth day prior to the due date for such Tax
Return, such disagreement shall be resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm
mutatis mutandis in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in Section 1.4(e), and any such determination by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final. The fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders). If the Independent
Accounting Firm does not resolve any differences between Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative with respect to such Tax Return at least five
days prior to the due date therefor, such Tax Return shall be prepared and
filed consistent with past practices of the Company and its subsidiaries and
in accordance with Parent's instructions and such Tax Return shall be amended
to reflect the Independent Accounting Firm's resolution.

Section 5.2 Straddle Period and other Conventions. In the case of any taxable
period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income or receipts
of the Company and its subsidiaries for the Straddle Period shall be
determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (provided, that exemptions, allowances or
deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions), other than with respect to property placed in
service after the Closing, shall be allocated on a per-diem basis), and (b)
the amount of other Taxes of the Company and its subsidiaries for a Straddle
Period that relate to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period. Pre-Closing Taxes shall be calculated by (1) for the purpose
of computing any income described in Sections 951(a)(1) or 951A(a) of the
Code, treating the Closing Date as the last day of the taxable year of the
Company's subsidiaries that are "controlled foreign corporations" (under
Section 957 of the Code), (2) treating all Transaction Deductions as deducted
on Tax Returns for the taxable period that ends (or is deemed to end) as of
the end of the day on the Closing Date to the extent permitted by applicable
Law on a "should" basis, (3) assuming that the Company makes a timely election
under Revenue Procedure 2011-29, 2011-18 I.R.B. 746, by applying the seventy
percent (70%) safe-harbor to any Transaction Deductions that are "success
based fees" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.263(a)-5(f), and (4)
applying any net operating losses of the Company arising in taxable periods
ending (or deemed to end) on or prior to the Closing Date against income
arising in Pre-Closing Tax Periods to the extent permitted by applicable Law
(including, if permitted by applicable law, pursuant to a carryback that would
not require the filing of an amended Tax Return by the Company or its
subsidiaries for Tax years ending after the Closing Date or by Parent or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Company or its subsidiaries).

Section 5.3 Contests. Parent will have the right to control, at its own
expense, any audit, examination, contest, litigation or other proceeding by or
against any taxing authority (a "Tax Proceeding") in respect of the Company
and its subsidiaries for any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing
Date and for any Straddle Period, and will defend such Tax Proceeding
diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in
connection with such Tax Proceeding; provided, however, that Parent (a) will
consult with the Stockholders' Representative before taking any significant
action in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (b) will consult with the
Stockholders' Representative and offer the Stockholders' Representative an
opportunity to comment before submitting any written materials prepared or
furnished in connection with such Tax Proceeding, (c) will provide the
Stockholders' Representative with the opportunity to participate, at the expense of the Company
Stockholders, in any such Tax Proceeding and (d) will not settle or compromise
any such Tax Proceeding, to the extent that it could increase the Tax
liability of the Company Equityholders in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax
Period (including as a result of an indemnification claim pursuant to this
Agreement), without the prior written consent of the Stockholders'
Representative (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 5.4 Cooperation. After the Closing, Parent and the Stockholders'
Representative shall promptly make available or cause to be made available to
the other, as reasonably requested, and to any taxing authority, all
information, records or documents relating to Tax Liabilities and potential
Tax Liabilities relating to the Company and its subsidiaries for all periods
prior to or including the Closing Date, including workpapers used to prepare
Tax Returns, and shall preserve all such information, records and documents
until seven years following the Closing Date. Thereafter, Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative may dispose of any such information, records or
documents after offering the other Party reasonable notice and opportunity to
take possession of such Tax Returns and other documents, provided that any
such notice must in any event be made in writing at least 60 days prior to
such disposition. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Stockholders' Representative shall have no obligation to prepare or file
any Tax Returns on behalf of the Company or its subsidiaries.

Section 5.5 Post-Closing Actions. In each case if such action could have the
effect of reducing any Tax asset of the Company or its subsidiaries or
increasing the Tax liability of the Company, its subsidiaries or the Company
Equityholders or their affiliates in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including as result of an indemnification claim pursuant to this Agreement),
(a) without the prior written consent of the Stockholders' Representative (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall not, and
shall not cause or permit any of its affiliates to, amend any Tax Return of
the Company or its subsidiaries with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period or participate in any amnesty or similar program with respect
to Taxes of the Company or its subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a
Straddle Period, and (b) Parent shall provide written notice to, and consult
in good faith with, the Stockholders' Representative prior to initiating any
voluntary contracts with any Tax authority regarding, or taking, any voluntary
self-corrective action with respect to Taxes of the Companies or its
subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period.

Section 5.6 Refunds. Parent shall pay any refunds of Taxes of the Company
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period to the Paying Agent (for further
distribution to the Company Stockholders) promptly following actual receipt
thereof.

Section 5.7 Transfer Taxes. Transfer Taxes, if any, shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by the Company Stockholders and (50%) by Parent, and any Tax
Returns with respect thereto shall be prepared and filed by the party required
by applicable Law to do so.



ARTICLE VI

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 6.1 Indemnification.

(a)Indemnification by Company Equityholders. Subject to the limits set forth
in Section 6.1(e), from and after the Closing, the Company Equityholders,
severally but not jointly, will indemnify, defend and hold Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective officers, directors and affiliates, as well as, after the
Closing, the Surviving Company, its subsidiaries, and their respective
officers, directors and affiliates (other than the Company Stockholders) (all
of such persons are collectively referred to herein as the "Parent Indemnified Parties") harmless from and in respect of
any and all Losses that any of them incur to the extent arising out of or in
connection with:

(i)any inaccuracy or breach of:

1)any representation or warranty made by to the Company contained in ARTICLE
II of this Agreement or in any agreement or the certificate delivered pursuant
to Section 7.1(f)(i); or

2)any covenant, undertaking or other agreement of the Company contained in
this Agreement;

(ii)any Specified Tax Liabilities;

(iii)any inaccuracy contained in the Disbursement Schedule;

(iv)any failure to timely (1) file IRS Form 1094-C or IRS Form 1095-C, or (2)
distribute an IRS Form 1095-C to each employee of the Company, in each case
with respect to the Company's 2019 fiscal year; or

(v)any claims or threatened claims by a Company Stockholder (i) alleging a
breach of any fiduciary duty of any Person (including aiding and abetting a
breach of fiduciary duty) relating to or arising out of any action taken (or
failed to be taken) in connection with this Agreement or the negotiation,
approval or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) with
respect to or otherwise relating to the proceeds payable to such Company
Stockholder in connection herewith.



For the avoidance of doubt, if any claim for indemnification made pursuant to
Section 6.1(a)(i)2) through Section 6.1(a)(v) above (each, a "Special
Indemnity Claim") also could be made or brought under or pursuant to Section
6.1(a)(i)1) above, Parent and the other Parent Indemnified Parties need not
bring such Special Indemnity Claim under Section 6.1(a)(i)2) through Section
6.1(a)(v) above, and the Company Equityholders and the Stockholders'
Representative shall not assert as a defense thereto or otherwise that such
Special Indemnity Claim should instead be brought under or pursuant to Section
6.1(a)(i)1) above.

(b)Indemnification by Parent and Merger Sub. Subject to the limits set forth
in Section 6.1(e), Parent and Merger Sub agree to jointly and severally
indemnify, defend and hold the Company Stockholders, their subsidiaries,
officers, directors and affiliates and their respective heirs, successors and
permitted assigns (the "Stockholder Indemnified Parties") harmless from and in
respect of any and all Losses that the Stockholder Indemnified Parties incur
to the extent arising out of, in connection with any inaccuracy or breach of:

(i)any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub contained in ARTICLE
III of this Agreement or the certificate delivered pursuant to Section
7.2(f)(i); or

(ii)any covenant, undertaking or other agreement of Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement.

(c)Materiality Qualifiers. The Parties acknowledge and agree that certain
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and certificates
and agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement, and certain defined terms
used or included therein, are qualified by references to "material,"
"materiality," "material respects" and the like (including by reference to a
dollar threshold), or by matters having or not having a "Company Material
Adverse Effect" (all of the foregoing, "Materiality Qualifiers").
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for purposes of (i)
determining whether a representation or warranty in this Agreement or any
certificate or agreement delivered pursuant to this Agreement has been
breached or is inaccurate, and (ii) determining and calculating the amount of a claim and any related Loss resulting from such a
breach or inaccuracy, all such Materiality Qualifiers in such representations
and warranties (and defined terms used or referenced therein other than the
use of the word "material" as part of any defined term) shall be ignored and
disregarded and the representations and warranties (and defined terms used or
referenced therein) shall be construed without regard to any such Materiality
Qualifiers therein contained, except that notwithstanding the foregoing, the
reference to Company Material Adverse Effect in the first sentence of Section
2.6 shall not be so ignored or disregarded.

(d)Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The representations,
warranties and covenants of the Parties contained in this Agreement or the
certificates delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(f)(i) or Section 7.2(f)(i) will
survive the Closing Date and will remain in full force and effect (i) in the
case of the Fundamental Representations, until six years following the Closing
Date; (ii) in the case of all other representations and warranties, until the
date that is 12 months following the Closing Date; (iii) in the case of all
covenants and agreements that are to be performed on or prior to the Closing
Date, until the date that is 12 months following the Closing Date; and (iv) in
the case of the covenants and agreements that by their terms are to be
performed after the Closing Date, for the respective terms specified therein
or, if no term is specified, until fully discharged; provided, however, that,
in each case, such representations, warranties and covenants shall survive
beyond their respective periods with respect to any inaccuracy therein or
breach thereof, notice of which shall have been duly given within such
applicable period in accordance with Section 6.1(f) hereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, claims related to Fraud with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall survive until 90 days after the
expiration of the date on which the statute of limitations otherwise
applicable to such claims has expired.

(e)Limitations on Indemnification Obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein:

(i)(A) With respect to the indemnification obligations of the Company
Equityholders pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i)1), the Company Equityholders shall
not be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Parties under Section
6.1(a)(i)1) unless the aggregate of all Losses for which the Company
Equityholders would, but for this clause (i)(A), be liable under Section
6.1(a)(i)1) exceeds on a cumulative basis $550,000 (the "Deductible"), at
which point, subject to any other applicable limitations contained in this
Section 6.1(e), the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to all
indemnification amounts under Section 6.1(a)(i)1) from the Company
Equityholders in excess of the Deductible up to an amount equal to $1,100,000
(the "Retention"); and (B) with respect to the indemnification obligations of
the Company Equityholders pursuant to Section 6.1(a), the Company
Equityholders shall not be obligated to indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties
under Section 6.1(a) for any Losses for which the Company Equityholders would,
but for this clause (B), be obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Parties under Section 6.1(a) in excess of an amount equal to the Closing
Payment plus the Earnout Amount that is actually paid pursuant to this
Agreement (or would be paid but for an offset against such Earnout Amount in
accordance with this Agreement); provided, however, that the limitations in
Section 6.1(e)(i)(A) shall not apply (x) to any indemnification obligations
arising from the Fundamental Representations, or (y) in the case of Fraud with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The amount
equal to the Retention minus the Deductible is defined herein as the
"Stockholder Retention Amount".

 (ii)With respect to the indemnification obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(i), Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to
indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified Parties under Section 6.1(b)(i) unless
the aggregate of all Losses for which Parent and Merger Sub would, but for
this clause (ii), be liable under this Agreement exceeds on a cumulative basis
the Deductible, at which point the Stockholder Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to all indemnification amounts under Section 6.1(b)(i) in excess of
the Deductible, provided, however, that the limitations in this Section
6.1(e)(ii) shall not apply (A) to any indemnification obligations arising from
the Fundamental Representations, or (B) in the case of Fraud with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(iii)With respect to the indemnification obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
pursuant to Section 6.1(b), Parent and Merger Sub shall not be obligated to
indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified Parties under Section 6.1(b) for any
Losses for which Parent or Merger Sub would, but for this clause (iii), be
obligated to indemnify the Stockholder Indemnified Parties under Section
6.1(b) in excess of an amount equal to the Closing Payment plus the Earnout
Amount; provided, however, that the limitations in this clause (iv) shall not
apply (A) to any indemnification obligations arising from the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.2 or Section 3.7, or (B) in the case of
Fraud with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(iv)The Company or the Stockholders' Representative shall not be entitled to
contribution or any other payments from the Company or any of its subsidiaries
for any Losses for which the Company or the Stockholders' Representative (on
behalf of the Company Equityholders) is obligated to make any payment to any
Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement (including ARTICLE VI).



(f)Indemnification Notice; Litigation Notice. If a party believes that it is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 6.1(a) or Section 6.1(b) (the
"Claimant"), it shall so notify the Party which the Claimant believes has an
obligation to indemnify (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly in writing
describing such indemnification obligation and any Loss related thereto in
reasonable detail and the amount thereof, if known, all with reasonable
particularity (the "Indemnification Notice"); provided that any
Indemnification Notice originating from Parent or Merger Sub only need to be
delivered to the Stockholders' Representative. If any Proceeding is instituted
by or against a third party with respect to which the Claimant intends to
claim any Liability or expense as a Loss under this ARTICLE VI, it shall
promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Proceeding
describing such Loss, the amount thereof, if known, and the method of
computation of such Loss, all with reasonable particularity (the "Litigation
Notice") in lieu of an Indemnification Notice; provided that any Litigation
Notice originating from Parent or Merger Sub only need to be delivered to the
Stockholders' Representative. No failure or delay by the Claimant with respect
to an Indemnification Notice or a Litigation Notice in the performance of the
foregoing shall reduce or otherwise affect the indemnification or
reimbursement obligations hereunder, except and only to the extent that such
failure or delay shall have adversely affected the Indemnifying Party's
ability to defend against, settle or satisfy any Loss for which the
indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or reimbursement hereunder.

(g)Defense of Third Person Claims.

(i)The Indemnifying Party shall have the right after receipt of the Litigation
Notice to promptly notify the Claimant that it elects to undertake, conduct
and assume control (through counsel of Indemnifying Party's choice reasonably
acceptable to Claimant) any Proceeding instituted by a third party with
respect to an identifiable claim (the "Election Notice"); provided, that as a
condition precedent to the Indemnifying Party's right to assume control of
such defense, the Indemnifying Party must first demonstrate to Claimant in writing reasonable evidence of the
Indemnifying Party's financial ability to assume control of such defense of
such third party claim; provided, further, that the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to assume control of such defense and shall pay the fees
and expenses of counsel retained by the Claimant (to the extent required
herein), if (1) the third party claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief,
or relief for other than money damages against the Claimant that the Claimant
reasonably determines, after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be
separated from any related claim for money damages, (2) the third party claim
involves criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation
that could reasonably be expected to involve incarceration of Claimant, any of
its affiliates or any of their respective Personnel, (3) the parties to any
such third party claim or threatened third party claim (including any
impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying Party and the Claimant and
the Indemnifying Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel for the
Claimant that there exists legal conflicts of interest pursuant to applicable
rules of professional conduct between the Indemnifying Party and the Claimant,
(4) the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to use Reasonable Efforts to
diligently prosecute or defend such third party claim, or (5) the RandW Insurer
has exercised a right to defend the third party claim under the RandW Policy.

(ii)If the Indemnifying Party timely gives the foregoing Election Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, subject to the provisos contained in
the first sentence of Section 6.1(g)(i), to undertake, conduct and assume
control, at the Indemnifying Party's sole expense, the conduct and settlement
of such Proceeding, and the Claimant shall reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party in such Proceeding, including providing reasonable access
to the Indemnifying Party to records and Personnel of the Company, as
applicable; provided, however, (A) the Indemnifying Party shall conduct such
Proceeding diligently and in good faith, (B) the Indemnifying Party shall
permit the Claimant to participate in such Proceeding through legal counsel
chosen by the Claimant, but the fees and expenses of such legal counsel shall
be borne solely by the Claimant (unless a conflict of interest exists between
the Indemnifying Party and the Claimant, in which case the expense of one firm
of Claimant's legal counsel shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party), (C)
upon a final determination of such Proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall
promptly reimburse the Claimant, to the extent required under this ARTICLE VI,
for the full amount of any Loss incurred by the Claimant, except fees and
expenses of legal counsel to be borne by the Claimant pursuant to clause (B)
above, and (D) the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to pay or settle
any such Proceeding provided the Claimant has no Liability with respect to
such settlement and the settlement does not impose injunctive or other
equitable relief against the Claimant or encumber any of Claimant's assets.

(iii)The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable out-of-pocket
fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Claimant for any period during
which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed (or is not entitled to assume)
the defense of a Proceeding with respect to which an Indemnification Notice or
a Litigation Notice has been issued by or on behalf of the Claimant.



(h)Calculation of Losses. The amount of any Loss will be determined net of any
Tax benefits actually realized in connection with (and in the same year as the
payment or incurrence of) such Loss, and any amounts actually recovered by the
Parent Indemnified Parties under insurance policies (including the RandW Policy)
or other collateral sources (such as contractual indemnities of any Person
which are contained outside of this Agreement) with respect to such Loss (in
each case, net of (A) any increase in future or retroactive premiums directly
and solely resulting from such Loss, (B) any deductibles incurred in obtaining
such amounts and any self-insurance retention amounts, and (C) costs of
collection or other cost incurred in connection with the receipt of such
proceeds). Parent shall use Reasonable Efforts to make any insurance claims
under applicable insurance policies then in effect that reasonably relate to and provide coverage with respect to any Loss for which
any Parent Indemnified Party has been indemnified under this ARTICLE VI.

(i)Effect of RandW Policy. With respect to all claims for Losses made pursuant
to this ARTICLE VI for which coverage is available and sought under the RandW
Policy, to the extent the procedures in this ARTICLE VI are inconsistent with
the procedures, requirements, terms, conditions or other provisions of the RandW
Policy with regard to matters such as notice, retention of counsel, settlement
or defense of claims or any other matter addressed in this ARTICLE VI, the
procedures in the RandW Policy shall control, it being understood that such
inconsistency shall not relieve the Claimant from its obligations to give
notice to the Indemnifying Party if such claim involves any matter for which
indemnification may be required to be made by the Company Stockholders (and
not exclusively under the RandW Policy).

(j)Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. The Parties agree to treat any
indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the
consideration payable to Company Equityholders pursuant to ARTICLE I of this
Agreement for all Tax purposes, and the Parties agree to file their Tax
Returns accordingly.

(k)No Double Counting. To the extent that a Loss for which the Parent
Indemnified Parties would otherwise be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 6.1(a) with respect to a breach of a representation or warranty (but
not a breach of a covenant) consists of or includes a liability that is
expressly reflected as a current liability in the Closing Net Working Capital,
or as Funded Debt, Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses in the Final
Statement, then the Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be indemnified for
such Loss under this ARTICLE VI to the extent and by the amount of such
liability included in the Closing Net Working Capital, Indebtedness or
Transaction Expenses as reflected in the Final Statement.

(l)Exclusive Remedy and Release. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of this ARTICLE VI
shall be the sole and exclusive remedies for any Losses (including any Losses
from claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including
negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict
liability, or otherwise) that Parent or Merger Sub may at any time suffer or
incur, or become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any breach of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement, or any failure to perform or
comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to have been
performed, or complied with, under this Agreement; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply to claims against any Party of Fraud by such Party;
and provided, further, that the foregoing shall not apply to the Parties'
rights to seek specific performance as contemplated by Section 9.13.

(m)Mitigation. Each of the Parties agrees to use its Reasonable Efforts to
mitigate its respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable under this ARTICLE VI.

(n)Payment of Claims.

(i)Subject to the other limitations contained in this ARTICLE VI, any amounts
owing to any Parent Indemnified Party shall be paid solely as follows:

(A)pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i)1) (other than with respect to a Fundamental
Representation) shall be paid (x) first, with respect to any Losses included
in the Stockholder Retention Amount, via offset against any portion of the
Earnout Amount payable pursuant to Section 1.5, and (y) second, with respect
to amounts above the Retention, under and in accordance with the terms of the
RandW Policy; (B)pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i)1) with respect to any Fundamental
Representation, or pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(ii) with respect to any
Specified Tax Liabilities, shall be paid as follows: (w) first, with respect
to any Losses included in the Stockholder Retention Amount, via offset against
any portion of the Earnout Amount payable pursuant to Section 1.5, (x) second,
from the RandW Policy, if and to the extent that all or any part of such claim
is actually recovered, under and in accordance with the terms of the RandW
Policy, (y) third, via offset against any portion of the Earnout Amount
payable pursuant to Section 1.5, and (z) fourth, to the extent any such
amounts are not recovered under clauses (w), (x) or (y), from the Company
Equityholders; provided, that, the right provided for under the foregoing
clause (z) shall (i) be available only with respect to any Indemnification
Notice properly delivered in accordance with this ARTICLE VI during the
duration of the Earnout Period, except in the case of Fraud, and (ii) not
apply in the case of claims pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i)2) in respect of any
covenant, undertaking or other agreement that is by its terms to be performed
on or prior to the Closing Date; and

(C)pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(i)2), Section 6.1(a)(iii), Section 6.1(a)(iv)
shall be as follows: (x) first, via offset against any portion of the Earnout
Amount payable pursuant to Section 1.5, and (y) then, to the extent any such
amounts are not recovered under clause (x), from the Company Equityholders;
provided, that, the right provided for under the foregoing clause (y) shall
(i) be available only with respect to any Indemnification Notice delivered in
accordance with this ARTICLE VI during the duration of the Earnout Period,
except in the case of Fraud, and (ii) not apply in the case of claims pursuant
to Section 6.1(a)(i)2) in respect of any covenant, undertaking or other
agreement that is by its terms to be performed on or prior to the Closing
Date.

(ii)Claims for indemnification made pursuant to this Agreement that are not
covered by the RandW Policy shall be paid, or deemed to be offset from the
Earnout Amount, if applicable, within five days of a final written settlement
among the Indemnifying Parties and the Indemnified Parties or upon a final
adjudication determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that an
indemnification obligation is owing by the Indemnifying Party to the
Indemnified Party.

Section 9.4 Counterparts; Delivery. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
original, PDF or facsimile counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, and all of which taken together shall be considered one and the same
agreement. Each executed signature page to this Agreement and to each
agreement and certificate delivered by a Party pursuant to this Agreement may
be delivered by any of the methods described in Section 9.2 hereof, including
via facsimile or e-mail, provided that such delivery is effected in accordance
with the notice information provided for in Section 9.2 hereof. In the event
that any signature to this Agreement or any agreement or certificate delivered
pursuant hereto, or any amendment thereof, is delivered by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, such
signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing
(or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect
as if such facsimile or ".pdf" signature page were an original thereof. No
Party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a
".pdf" format data file to deliver any such signature page or the fact that
such signature was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile
machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of a contract and each Party forever waives any
such defense.

Section 9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Schedule), the Confidentiality Agreement and the Related Agreements constitute
the entire agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the Parties (including the non-binding indication
of interest by and between the Company and Parent, dated September 16, 2020)
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Related
Agreements; provided that no concession is made that any prior agreement or
understanding (oral or otherwise) exists, other than such indication of
interest.

Section 9.6 Parties in Interest. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of each of the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns and nothing in this Agreement is intended to confer any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement on any Person other
than Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Company Stockholders, the
Stockholders' Representative and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

Section 9.7 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
of this Agreement shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of any
other provision of this Agreement. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under Law.
In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
provision or provisions shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would
be unreasonable.

Section 9.8 Governing Law. All issues and questions concerning the
construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement and
the Schedules and Exhibits hereto shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to
any choice of law or conflict of law rules or provisions (whether of the State
of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware. In furtherance of the foregoing, the
internal law of the State of Delaware shall control the interpretation and
construction of this Agreement (and all Schedules and Exhibits hereto), even
though under that jurisdiction's choice of law or conflict of law analysis,
the substantive law of some other jurisdiction would ordinarily apply.

Section 9.9 Dispute Resolution for Direct Claims. In the event of a Dispute
(provided that for the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.9 shall not be
applicable with respect to any claim for indemnification for which a
Litigation Notice was provided) and the Indemnifying Party disputes all or any
part of the Indemnification Notice relating to such Dispute, Parent and the
Stockholders' Representative shall first attempt to resolve such Dispute
through direct negotiations. Any Party may initiate this process by making a
written demand for direct negotiation that describes the Dispute to be
negotiated in reasonable detail. At either Party's option, such direct
negotiations may be held telephonically or in person. No settlement reached in
such negotiations under this Section 9.9 shall be binding until reduced to a
writing signed by the applicable Parties. If the Dispute is not resolved
within 20 Business Days after the date of the demand for direct negotiation,
then the Stockholders' Representative and/or Parent may petition to any court
of competent jurisdiction in accordance with and pursuant to Section 9.10 to
resolve such Dispute. Nothing in this Section 9.9 shall prevent any party from
seeking injunctive relief under Section 9.10 (which injunctive relief, for the
avoidance of doubt, may be sought prior to complying with this Section 9.9).

Section 9.10 Court Proceedings; Jurisdiction. For the purpose of any
Proceeding permitted by the terms of this Agreement to be filed in a court
(which shall not include disputes relating to the Closing Adjustment or the
Earnout Amount pursuant to Section 1.4 and Section 1.5 hereof (except for the
enforcement of any ruling of the Independent Accounting Firm thereunder)),
which Proceeding is brought to enforce, challenge or construe the terms or
making of this Agreement, and any Proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement, each of the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of
Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state
or federal court sitting in Delaware), in any such Proceeding, agrees that all
claims in respect of any such Proceeding may be heard and determined in any
such court and agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating thereto in any other court. Each of the Parties waives any defense of
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such Proceeding so brought and
waives any bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other
Party with respect thereto.

Section 9.11 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, WHICH CANNOT BE WAIVED, FOR ANY PROCEEDING WHICH IS PERMITTED UNDER THIS
AGREEMENT TO BE FILED IN A COURT, EACH PARTY HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN SUCH PROCEEDING, INCLUDING THOSE
PROCEEDINGS TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR UNDER ANY
AMENDMENT, CONSENT, WAIVER, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT OR AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR
WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF THEM OR ARISING
FROM ANY RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
AGREES THAT IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, THE MATTERS SHALL BE TRIED TO A COURT AND
NOT TO A JURY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
SUCH PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY
MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS Section 9.11.

Section 9.12 Service of Process. Each Party irrevocably consents to the
service of summons and complaint and any other process outside the territorial
jurisdiction of the courts referred to in Section 9.10 hereof in any
Proceeding by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the Party to be
served at the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the giving
of notices in Section 9.2 hereof (except that email shall not be a permitted
delivery means pursuant to this Section 9.12). Nothing herein shall affect the
right of any Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 9.13 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
other Party or Parties would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached or violated. Accordingly, each Party
agrees, subject to Section 8.2, that, without posting bond or other
undertaking, the other Party or Parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the provisions of this Agreement in any
Proceeding from, by or before any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over
the parties and the matter in addition to any other remedy to which it may be
entitled, at law or in equity. Each Party further agrees that, in the event of
any such action for specific performance in respect of such breach or
violation, it will not assert the defense that a remedy at law would be
adequate or that the consideration reflected in this Agreement was inadequate
or that the terms of this Agreement were not just and reasonable.

Section 9.14 Assignment. No Party to this Agreement shall have the right to
assign or delegate his, her or its rights or duties hereunder, in whole or in
part, without the prior written consent of the other parties to this Agreement
in their sole discretion; provided, however, that Parent or Merger Sub may
assign any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to (a) one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries (in which case
Parent and/or Merger Sub nonetheless shall remain responsible for the
performance of all of its obligations under this Agreement), (b) any
subsequent purchaser of Parent or any of its subsidiaries or all or any part
of the business or assets of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (whether such
sale is structured as a sale of stock, a sale of assets, a merger or
otherwise), or (c) any lender of Parent or Merger Sub as security for
obligations to such lender in respect of any financing arrangements entered
into by Parent or Merger Sub, and any refinancings, extensions, refundings or
renewals thereof. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and
their respective permitted successors and assigns. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Section 9.14 shall be void.

Section 9.15 Expenses. Except as set forth in this Agreement, all costs and
expenses (including all legal, accounting, broker, finder or investment banker
fees) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are to be paid by the party incurring the expenses.

Section 9.16 Headings. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement, the Table of Contents, the Index of Exhibits, the Exhibits, the
Index of Schedules, the Schedules, the Index of Defined Terms, and the
schedules included in the Company Disclosure Schedule, are for convenience of
the Parties only, and shall be given no substantive or interpretative effect
whatsoever.

Section 9.17 Cumulative Remedies; No Waiver. Except as specifically set forth
herein, the rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. No failure or delay on the part of any Party in exercising any right, power or remedy under
this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of such right, power or remedy, and
no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or remedy or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy. To the maximum extent permitted
by Law: (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement can be discharged
by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or
right unless in writing signed by the Party or Parties against whom the waiver
is to be effective; provided, however, that the Stockholders' Representative
may provide such a waiver for each Company Equityholders; (b) no waiver that
may be given by a Party shall be applicable except in the specific instance
for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one Party shall be
deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that Party or of the right of the
Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or
demand as provided in this Agreement.



Section 9.18 Schedules, Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits. The Schedules
hereto, the Disclosure Schedule and the Exhibits hereto are hereby
incorporated by reference into, and made a part of, this Agreement. The
disclosure of any matter on a Section of the Disclosure Schedule shall be
deemed to be a disclosure for each representation and warranty to which it is
reasonably apparent on its face from the disclosure that such matters relate.
Any capitalized and undefined term used in any Section of the Disclosure
Schedule shall have the same meaning that is assigned to such term in this
Agreement.
