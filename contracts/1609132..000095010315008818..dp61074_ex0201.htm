Section 1.06. _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, Buyer shall consider or be advised that any further deeds, documents,
assignments or assurances in Law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Company, Company Bank and
their respective Subsidiaries shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer and
Buyer Bank, and each or any of them, an irrevocable power of attorney to

without any conversion thereof, and no payment shall be made with
respect thereto.

  



  

(c)  Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than treasury stock and shares described
in Section 2.01(b) above) shall automatically and without any further action
on the part of the holder thereof be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (and cash in lieu of shares of Buyer Common Stock as set
forth in Section 2.03) in accordance with this Article 2.

  



  

Section 2.02. _Rights as Shareholders; Stock Transfers_. At the
Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock, when converted in
accordance with Section 2.01(c) above, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each Certificate or Book-Entry Share previously evidencing such shares shall
thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such share of Company
Common Stock, the Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of shares of
Buyer Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.03) in accordance with this
Article 2. At the Effective Time, holders of Company Common Stock shall cease
to be, and shall have no rights as, shareholders of Company, other than the
right to receive the Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of shares of
Buyer Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.03) in accordance with this
Article 2. After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of Company of shares of Company Common

(a)  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no fractional shares of
Buyer Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence
of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger. In lieu thereof, Buyer
shall pay or cause to be paid to each holder of a fractional share of Buyer
Common Stock, rounded to the nearest one hundredth of a share, an amount of
cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by
multiplying the fractional share interest in Buyer Common

Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by the Buyer Average
Stock Price.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
a holder who will receive aggregate Merger Consideration consisting of less
than ten (10) whole shares of Buyer Common Stock shall instead receive an
amount of cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent)
determined by multiplying the Buyer Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled (including any fraction thereof as if Section 2.03(a)
was not applicable) by the Buyer Average Stock Price.

  



  

Section 2.04. _Plan of Reorganization_. It is intended that the Merger
shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and that this
Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" as that term is used in
Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. The business purpose of the Merger and the
Bank Merger is to combine two financial institutions to create a strong
community-based commercial banking franchise. From and after the date of this
Agreement and until the Closing, each party hereto shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

Section 2.05. _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after
the Effective Time but in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
Closing Date, and provided that Company has delivered, or caused to be
delivered, to the Exchange Agent all information that is reasonably
required under the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, the Exchange Agent
shall mail or otherwise cause to be delivered to each holder of record of
shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time
("Holder") appropriate and customary transmittal materials in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Company and the Exchange Agent, which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss and/or bonds in such amounts as may be
required in each case by Buyer or the Exchange Agent in lieu of such
Certificate(s)) or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent, as well as
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of
shares of Buyer Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.03) in accordance with
this Article 2 as provided for in this Agreement (the "Letter of
Transmittal"). Buyer and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
the stock transfer books of Company to establish the identity of the Holders
of shares of Company Common Stock, which books shall be conclusive with
respect thereto.

  



  

Section 2.06. _Deposit of Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a)  At or before the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit, or shall cause
to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent stock certificates representing the
number of shares of Buyer Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate
Merger Consideration payable under the terms hereof (together with, to the
extent then determinable any cash payable in lieu of shares of Buyer Common
Stock as set forth in Section 2.03) in

   

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

accordance with this Article 2 (collectively, the "Exchange Fund"),
and Buyer shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely pay such consideration
in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Company for one (1) year after the Effective Time (as well as
any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by
the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any shareholders of Company who have not
theretofore complied with this Section 2.06 and Section 2.07(a) shall
thereafter look only to Buyer for the Merger Consideration (and any cash in
lieu of shares of Buyer Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.03) in
accordance with this Article 2 deliverable in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock such shareholder held as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case
without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for shares of Company Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for
them is not claimed prior to the date on which such shares of Buyer Common
Stock or cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the
extent permitted by the law of abandoned property and any other applicable
Law, become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession
shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor
any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any Holder represented by any
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for any Merger Consideration (or any
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  



  

Section 2.07. _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a)  Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-
Entry Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed Letter of Transmittal
timely delivered to the Exchange Agent, a Holder will be entitled to receive
as promptly as practicable thereafter the aggregate Merger Consideration (and
any cash in lieu of shares of Buyer Common Stock as set forth in
Section 2.03) in accordance with this Article 2 to be issued or paid in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Holder's
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The Exchange Agent and Buyer, as the case
may be, shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or shares of Buyer Common
Stock to a Holder to which such Holder would otherwise be entitled as a
result of the Merger until such Holder surrenders the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares representing the shares of Company Common Stock for exchange as
provided in this Article 2, or, an appropriate affidavit of loss and
indemnity agreement and/or a bond in such amount as may be reasonably required
in each case by Buyer or the Exchange Agent.

  



  

(b)  In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares for Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer
records of Company, the Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of shares
of Buyer Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.03) in accordance with this
Article 2 shall be issued or paid in exchange therefor to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered
is registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share

   

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

formerly representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such
payment or issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by
reason of the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer that the tax has been paid or is not applicable, and
the person requesting payment for such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
shall have complied with the provisions of the Letter of Transmittal. In the
event of a dispute with respect to ownership of any shares of Company Common
Stock represented by any Certificate or Book-Entry Share, Buyer and Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of any court of competent
jurisdiction any Merger Consideration (and any cash in lieu of shares of Buyer
Common Stock as set forth in Section 2.03) represented by such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share and file legal proceedings interpleading all parties to such
dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

  



  

(c)  All shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Buyer in respect of the Buyer
Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time,
that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of
all shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the Buyer Common Stock shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
until such Certificate (or affidavit of loss and/or a bond in such amount as
may be required in each case by Buyer or the Exchange Agent in lieu of such
Certificate) or Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance
with this Article 2. Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavit of loss and/or a bond in such
amount as may be required in each case by Buyer or the Exchange Agent in lieu
of such Certificate(s)) or Book-Entry Share, there shall be issued and/or
paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Buyer
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time
of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole
shares of Buyer Common Stock and not paid and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole
shares of Buyer Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but
with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

  



  

(d)  Buyer (through the Exchange Agent, if applicable) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Holder such amounts as Buyer is required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Buyer or the Exchange Agent, as applicable.

  



  

Section 2.08. _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event that on or after
the first trading day used in determining the Buyer Average Stock Price and
before the Effective Time (i) Buyer changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of, or

   

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

provides for the exchange of, shares of Buyer Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
reclassification, exchange or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Buyer Common Stock, or (ii) in the event that during the
Measurement Period Buyer declares or pays a special dividend on the
outstanding Buyer Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably
adjusted; _provided_ , that in the case of clause (ii) such adjustment shall
be made only in the event and to the extent that the closing prices of
Buyer Common Stock used in determining the Buyer Average Stock Price do not
reflect or take into account the effect on such closing prices of any such
special dividend; _provided further_ , that for the avoidance of doubt, no
such adjustment under clause (i) above shall be made with regard to the Buyer
Common Stock if (x) Buyer issues additional shares of Buyer Common Stock
and receives consideration for such shares in a bona fide third party
transaction, or (y) Buyer issues employee or director stock options,
restricted stock awards, grants or similar equity awards or Buyer issues Buyer
Common Stock upon exercise or vesting of any such options, grants or awards.
For purposes of this Section 2.08, the term "special dividend" shall mean
any dividend paid or payable in cash or other property that is in excess of
the regular quarterly dividend payable on Buyer Common Stock by more than a
_de minimis_ amount, in the ordinary course of Buyer's business, consistent
with past practice.

subsequent filing or, in the case of filings under the Securities Act, at the

events) result in any payment (whether change-of-control, severance pay or
otherwise) becoming due from Company, Company Bank, the Surviving Entity, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries to any officer, director or employee
thereof, or which would otherwise provide for a payment to such person upon a
change-of-control; (iv) the benefits of which will be increased, or the
vesting of benefits of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the
benefits of which will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions

right of first offer or similar right with respect to any material assets or
properties of Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (vi) related to the
borrowing by Company or any of its Subsidiaries of money other than those
entered into in the Ordinary Course of Business or between the Company and any

management or control of any material partnership or joint venture with any
third parties or which limits payments of dividends; (ix) which relates to
capital expenditures and involves future payments by Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in excess of $50,000 individually or $100,000 in the aggregate,

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries) to own, operate, sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of
any material assets or business; (xiii) pursuant to which Company or any of
its Subsidiaries may become obligated to invest in or contribute capital to
any entity; or (xiv) that transfers any Intellectual Property rights (other
than non-exclusive licenses to generally available commercial software),
by way of assignment, license, sublicense, agreement or other permission, to
or from Company or any of its Subsidiaries and that is material (for the
avoidance of doubt, any Patents shall be deemed material). Each contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this
Section 3.13(a), is set forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.13(a)_, and
is referred to herein as a "Company Material Contract." Company has
previously made available to Buyer true, complete and correct copies of each
such Company Material Contract, including any and all amendments and
modifications thereto.

  



  

(b)  (i) Each Company Material Contract is valid and binding on Company and
any of its Subsidiaries to the extent such Subsidiary is a party thereto, as
applicable, and to the Knowledge of Company, each other party thereto, and is
in full force and effect and enforceable in accordance with its terms, except
to the extent that validity and enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general
principles of equity or by principles of public policy and except where the
failure to be valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had a Material Adverse Effect on
Company or Company Bank; and (ii) neither Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in default under any Company Material Contract or other material
agreement, commitment, arrangement, Lease, Insurance Policy or other
instrument to which it is a party, by which its assets, business,
or operations may be bound or affected, or under which its assets, business,
or operations receives benefits, and there has not occurred any event that,
with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such
a default, except to the extent that such default or event of default has not
had, and is not reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect on
Company or Company Bank. No material power of attorney or similar
authorization

   

 | 18| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

given directly or indirectly by Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
currently outstanding.

  



  

(c)  Company Disclosure Schedule 3.13(c) sets forth a true and
complete list of all Company Material Contracts pursuant to which consents,
waivers or notices are or may be required to be given thereunder, in each
case, prior to the consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.14_ , neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or

understanding with, or is a party to any commitment letter or similar
undertaking to, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory
letter from, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has adopted any
board resolutions at the request of any Governmental Authority (each, whether
or not set forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.14_ , a "Company Regulatory
Agreement") that, in any such case, (a) currently restricts in any material
respect the conduct of Company's or any of its Subsidiaries' business or in
any material manner relates to their capital adequacy, their ability to pay
dividends, their credit, risk management or compliance policies, their
internal controls, their management or their business, other than those of
general application, or (b) would reasonably be expected to, individually or
in aggregate, materially and adversely impact or interfere with Company's or
Company Bank's operations, and, to the Knowledge of Company, since January 1,
2012, Company has not been advised by any Governmental Authority that it is
considering issuing, initiating, ordering or requesting any of the foregoing,
other than those of general application. To Company's Knowledge, there are no
investigations relating to any regulatory matters pending before any
Governmental Authority with respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 3.15. _Brokers; Fairness Opinion_. Neither Company, Company
Bank nor any of its officers, directors or any of its Subsidiaries has
employed any broker or finder or incurred, nor will it incur, any liability
for any broker's fees, commissions or finder's fees in connection with any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except that Company has
engaged, and will pay a fee or commission to Sandler O'Neill and Partners, L.P.
("Company Financial Advisor"), in accordance with the terms of a
letter agreement between Company Financial Advisor and Company, a true,
complete and correct copy of which has been previously delivered by Company
to Buyer. Company has received the opinion of the Company Financial Advisor
(and, when it is delivered in writing, a copy of such opinion will be
promptly provided to Buyer) to the effect that, as of the date of this
Agreement and based upon and subject to the qualifications and assumptions
set forth therein, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, and, as of
the date of this Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or
modified.

arrangements (i) covering current or former employees of Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of Company's related organizations described in Code
Sections 414(b), (c) or (m) ("Controlled Group Members") (such current and
former employees collectively, the "Company Employees"), (ii)
covering current or former directors of Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or
Controlled Group Members or (iii) with respect to which Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Controlled Group Members has any liability or contingent
liability (including liability arising from affiliation under Section 414 of
the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA) including, but not limited to, "employee
benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA, health/welfare,
change-of-control, fringe benefit, deferred compensation, defined benefit
plan, defined contribution plan, stock option, stock purchase, stock
appreciation rights, stock based, incentive, bonus plans, retirement plans
and other policies, plans or arrangements whether or not subject to ERISA (all
such plans, contracts, policies or arrangements in (i)-(iii) hereof are
collectively referred to as the "Company Benefit Plans"), are identified and
described in _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(a)_. Neither Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members has any stated plan, intention
or commitment to establish any new company benefit plan or to materially
modify any Company Benefit Plan (except to the extent required by Law).

  



  

(b)  Company has provided Buyer with true and complete copies of all Company
Benefit Plans including, but not limited to, any trust instruments and
insurance contracts forming a part of any Company Benefit Plans and all
amendments thereto, summary plan descriptions and summary of material
modifications, IRS Form 5500 (for the most recently completed plan year) and
the most recent IRS determination, opinion, notification and advisory
letters, with respect thereto. In addition, any annual and periodic
accounting and employee and participant disclosures pertaining to the Company
Benefit Plans have been made available to Buyer.

  



  

(c)  Each Company Benefit Plan is in compliance in all material respects
with its terms and in operation with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and
the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code ("Company 401(a) Plan"), has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS, and neither Company nor Company
Bank has Knowledge of any circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
result in revocation of any such favorable determination or opinion letter or
the loss of the qualification of such Company 401(a) Plan under Section 401(a)
of the Code, and, to Company's Knowledge, nothing has occurred that would be
expected to result in the Company 401(a) Plan ceasing to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code. In all material respects, all Company Benefits
Plans have been administered in accordance with their terms. There is no
pending or, to Company's Knowledge, threatened litigation or regulatory
action relating to the Company Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for
benefits or matters that are not material). Neither Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or any Controlled Group Member has engaged in a transaction with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan, including a Company 401(a) Plan that
could subject Company, any of its Subsidiaries or

   

 | 20| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

any Controlled Group Member to a material tax or material penalty under any
Law including, but not limited to, Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i)
of ERISA. No Company 401(a) Plan has been submitted under or been the subject
of an IRS voluntary compliance program submission. There are no material
audits, investigations, inquiries or proceedings pending or, to Company's
Knowledge, threatened by the IRS or the Department of Labor with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan.

  



  

(d)  No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled
Group Members with respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single
employer plan," within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently
or formerly maintained by Company, any of its Subsidiaries, Controlled Group
Members or any entity which is considered one employer with Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). Neither Company, Company Bank
nor any ERISA Affiliate (or their predecessor) has ever maintained a plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. None of
Company, Company Bank, or any ERISA Affiliate has contributed to (or been
obligated to contribute to) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA at any time and neither Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members has incurred, and does not expect to
incur, any withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions
of an ERISA Affiliate). No notice of a "reportable event," within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA has been required to be filed for any Company Benefit
Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate or will be required to be filed in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e)  All contributions required to be made with respect to all Company
Benefit Plans have been timely made or have been reflected on the
consolidated financial statements of Company to the extent required to be
reflected under applicable accounting principles.

  



  

(f)  Except as set forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(f_), no
Company Benefit Plan provides and neither Company nor Company Bank has
proposed or promised any arrangement that provides for any liability to
provide life insurance, medical or other employee welfare benefits to any
Company Employee, or any of their affiliates, upon his or her retirement or
termination of employment for any reason, except as may be required by Law
(including the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended).

  



  

(g)  All Company Benefit Plans that are group health plans have been
operated in compliance in all material respects with the group health plan
continuation requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and all other
applicable sections of ERISA and the Code. Company may amend or terminate any
such Company Benefit Plan at any time without incurring any material liability
thereunder for future benefits coverage at any time after such termination.

(h)  Except as set forth in _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(h)_ or
otherwise provided for in this Agreement, neither the execution of this
Agreement, shareholder approval of this Agreement or consummation of any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (i) entitle any Company
Employee to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of employment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting
(except as required by Law) or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any of
the Company Benefit Plans, (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any of the Company Benefit Plans, (iv) result in any payment
that would be an excess "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" as
those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code, without regard to
whether such payment is reasonable compensation for personal services
performed or to be performed in the future, (v) limit or restrict the right
of Company or Company Bank or, after the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, to merge,
amend or terminate any of the Company Benefit Plans, or (vi) result in
payments under any of the Company Benefit Plans for which a deduction would be
disallowed by reason of Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

(i)  Each Company Benefit Plan that is a deferred compensation plan or
arrangement is in material compliance with, and has been operated in material
compliance with, Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable. Neither
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members has agreed to
reimburse or indemnify any participant in a Company Benefit Plan for any of
the interest and the penalties specified in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code
that may be currently due or triggered in the future.

  



  

(j)   _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.16(j)_ contains a schedule
showing the monetary amounts payable as of the date specified in such
schedule, whether individually or in the aggregate (including good faith
estimates of all amounts not subject to precise quantification as of the date
of this Agreement, such as tax indemnification payments in respect of income
or excise taxes), under any employment, change-in-control, severance or
similar contract, plan or arrangement with or which covers any present or
former director, officer, employee or consultant of Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members who may be entitled to any such
amount and identifying the types and estimated amounts of the in-
kind benefits due under any Company Benefit Plans (other than a plan
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code) for each such person, specifying
the assumptions in such schedule and providing estimates of other required
contributions to any trusts for any related fees or expenses.

  



  

(k)  Except for failures that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Company, Company and its
Subsidiaries have correctly classified all individuals who directly or
indirectly perform services for Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
Controlled Group Members for purposes of each Company Benefit Plan, ERISA, the
Code, unemployment compensation Laws, workers' compensation Laws and all
other applicable Laws.

Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any collective bargaining agreement,
contract or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor
organization, nor is there any proceeding pending or, to Company's
Knowledge threatened, asserting that Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
committed an unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor
Relations Act) or seeking to compel Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment,
nor is there any strike or other labor dispute involving it pending or, to
Company's Knowledge, threatened, nor is Company or Company Bank aware of any
activity involving Company Employees seeking to certify a

or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, by contract, or otherwise.

  



  

(g)  The unpaid Taxes of Company (i) did not, as of December 31, 2014,

(j)  Neither the execution of this Agreement, Company shareholder approval
of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated

compliance with applicable Laws, and shall, as promptly as practicable
following execution of this Agreement, prepare and deliver drafts of such
information to Buyer to review. Each of Buyer and Company agree to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
filed with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, and to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the filing thereof. Buyer also agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any necessary state securities Law or "blue sky"
permits and approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Company agrees to cooperate with Buyer and Buyer's
counsel and accountants in requesting and obtaining appropriate opinions,
consents and letters from Company's independent auditors in connection with
the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus. After the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act,
Company, at its own expense, shall promptly mail or cause to be mailed the
Proxy Statement-Prospectus to its shareholders.

  



  

(b)  The Proxy Statement-Prospectus and the Registration Statement shall
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder. Buyer will advise Company, promptly after Buyer receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order
or the suspension of the qualification of Buyer Common Stock for offering or
sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for
any such purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or
supplement of the Registration Statement or upon the receipt of any comments
(whether written or oral) from the SEC or its staff. Buyer will provide
Company and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and,
except to the extent such response is submitted under confidential cover, all
responses to requests for additional information by and replies to comments of
the SEC (and reasonable good faith consideration shall be given to any
comments made by Company and its counsel) prior to filing such with, or
sending such to, the SEC, and Buyer will provide Company and its counsel with
a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. If at any time prior to the
Company Meeting there shall occur any event that should be disclosed in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the
Registration Statement, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly prepare and file such amendment or supplement with the SEC (if
required under applicable Law) and cooperate with Company to mail such
amendment or supplement to Company shareholders (if required under applicable
Law).

  



  

(c)  Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to be
approved for listing on NASDAQ, subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Effective Time.

Section 5.06. _Regulatory Filings; Consents_.

  



  

(a)  Each of Buyer and Company and their respective Subsidiaries shall
cooperate and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts (i) to
prepare all documentation (including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus), to
effect all filings, to obtain all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including without
limitation, the Regulatory Approvals and all other consents and approvals
of a Governmental Authority required to consummate the Merger in the manner
contemplated herein, (ii) to comply with the terms and conditions of such
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations and (iii) to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as
expeditiously as practicable; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall
Buyer be required to agree to any prohibition, limitation, or other
requirement which would prohibit or materially limit the ownership or
operation by Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or by Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries, of all or any material portion of the business or assets
of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or its Subsidiaries, or compel
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to dispose of all or any material portion of
the business or assets of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries or continue any portion of any Company Regulatory
Agreement against Buyer after the Merger (together, the "Burdensome
Conditions"). Subject to applicable Laws, (A) Buyer and Company will furnish
each other and each other's counsel with all information concerning
themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, trustees, officers and shareholders
and such other matters as may be necessary or advisable in connection with
any application, or petition made by or on behalf of Buyer or Company to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (B) each party hereto shall have the right to review and
approve in advance all characterizations of the information relating to such
party and any of its Subsidiaries that appear in any filing made in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any
Governmental Authority, (C) Buyer and Company shall each furnish to the other
for review a copy of each such filing made solely in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement with any Governmental Authority
prior to its filing and (D) Buyer will notify Company promptly and shall
promptly furnish Company with copies of any communication from any
Governmental Authority received by Buyer with respect to the
regulatory applications filed solely in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from Buyer or its
representatives); provided, that in no event shall Buyer or Buyer Bank be
obligated to provide or otherwise disclose to Company confidential
information regarding Buyer, Buyer Bank or any affiliates or any pending
merger transaction, other than the Merger.

  



  

(b)  Company will use commercially reasonable efforts, and Buyer shall
reasonably cooperate with Company at Company's request, to obtain all
consents, approvals, authorizations, waivers or similar affirmations described
on Company _Disclosure Schedule 3.13(c)_; provided that neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries will be required to make any payment to or grant any
concessions to any third party in connection therewith. Each party will, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, notify the other party promptly and
shall promptly furnish the other party with copies of notices

   

 | 54| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

or other communications received by such party or any of its Subsidiaries of
any communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
(or another Person) is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (and the response thereto from such party, its
Subsidiaries or its representatives). Company will reasonably consult with
Buyer and its representatives so as to permit Company and Buyer and their
respective representatives to cooperate to take appropriate measures to
obtain such consents and avoid or mitigate any adverse consequences that may
result from the foregoing.

  



  

Section 5.07. _Publicity_. Buyer and Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other
party, which shall not be unreasonably delayed or withheld; provided,
however, that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but
after such consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances),
issue such press release or make such public statements as may upon the
advice of counsel be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any stock
exchanges. It is understood that Buyer shall assume primary responsibility
for the preparation of joint press releases relating to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 5.08. _Access; Current Information_.

  



  

(a)  For the purposes of verifying the representations and warranties of
the other and preparing for the Merger and the other matters contemplated by
this Agreement, upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws, Company
agrees to afford Buyer and its officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives such access during normal business hours at
any time and from time to time throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time to Company's and Company's Subsidiaries' books, records (including,
without limitation, Tax Returns and, subject to the consent of the independent
auditors, work papers of independent auditors), information technology
systems, properties and personnel and to such other information relating to
them as Buyer may reasonably request and Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide any appropriate notices to employees and/or
customers in accordance with applicable Law and Company's privacy policy and,
during such period, Company shall furnish to Buyer, upon Buyer's reasonable
request, all such other information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of Company and its Subsidiaries that is substantially similar in
scope to the information provided to Buyer in connection with its diligence
review prior to the date of this Agreement.

  



  

(b)  As soon as reasonably practicable after they become available, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, Company will furnish to Buyer copies of
the board packages distributed to the Company Board or board of directors of
Company Bank, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, and minutes from the
meetings thereof, copies of any internal management financial control
reports showing actual financial performance against plan and previous
period, and copies of any reports provided to the Company

   

 | 55| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

Board or any committee thereof relating to the financial performance and risk
management of Company.

  



  

(c)  During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, each of Company and Buyer will cause one or more of its designated
representatives to confer on a regular basis with representatives of the other
party and to report the general status of the ongoing operations of Company
and its Subsidiaries and Buyer and its Subsidiaries, respectively. Without
limiting the foregoing, Company agrees to provide to Buyer, (i) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, a copy of each report filed by Company or any of
its Subsidiaries with a Governmental Authority reasonably promptly following
the filing thereof, (ii) a copy of Company's monthly loan trial balance
within five (5) Business Days of the end of the month, and (iii) a copy of
Company's monthly statement of condition and profit and loss statement within
fifteen (15) calendar days of the end of the month and, if requested by
Buyer, a copy of Company's daily statement of condition and daily profit and
loss statement, which shall be provided within two (2) Business Days of such
request.

  



  

(d)  No investigation by Buyer or its representatives shall be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
Company or Company Bank set forth in this Agreement, or the conditions to the
respective obligations of Buyer and Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. Any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.08, Section
5.13 and Section 5.18 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of business of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.08(e) to the
contrary, Company shall not be required to provide Buyer with any documents
that disclose confidential discussions or information relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or any other matter that
Company's or Company Bank's board of directors has been advised by counsel
that such distribution of which to Buyer may violate a confidentiality
obligation or fiduciary duty or any Law or regulation, or may result in a
waiver of Company's attorney-client privilege. In the event any of the
restrictions in this Section 5.08(e) shall apply, Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide appropriate consents, waivers,
decrees and approvals necessary to satisfy any confidentiality issues
relating to documents prepared or held by third parties (including work
papers), the parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to make
appropriate alternate disclosure arrangements, including adopting additional
specific procedures to protect the confidentiality of sensitive material and
to ensure compliance with applicable Laws.

  



  

Section 5.09. _No Solicitation by Company; Superior Proposals_.

  



  

(a)  Subject to Section 5.09(b), Company shall not, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors and
employees not to, and will not authorize any investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants, affiliates or other agents of
Company or any of Company's Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company
Representatives") to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,

   

 | 56| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

solicit, knowingly induce or encourage, or knowingly take any action to
facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes,
or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than,
for the avoidance of doubt, its officers, directors, employees and advisors or
Buyer) regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford
access, to any Person (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, its
officers, directors, employees and advisors or Buyer) any non-public
information or data with respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any Person from, waive
any provisions of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement or
standstill agreement to which Company is a party except if the Company Board
reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with and having
considered the advice of outside legal counsel that the failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
or (iv) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of
intent relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any of the Company Representatives, whether or not such
Company Representative is so authorized and whether or not such
Company Representative is purporting to act on behalf of Company or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
Company. Company and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the
Company Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications with any
Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any
inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Buyer), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction.

  



  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (A) any
transaction or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving Company or Company Bank that, in any such case, results
in any Person (or, in the case of a direct merger between such third
party and Company, Company Bank or any other Subsidiary of Company, the
shareholders of such third party) acquiring 20% or more of any class of
equity of Company or Company Bank; (B) any transaction pursuant to which any
third party or group acquires or would acquire (whether through sale, lease
or other disposition), directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the consolidated
assets of Company or Company Bank; (C) any issuance, sale or other
disposition of (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange
or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to
purchase or securities convertible into, such securities) representing 20% or
more of the votes attached to the outstanding securities of Company or Company
Bank; (D) any tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would
result in any third party or group beneficially owning 20% or more of any
class of equity securities of Company or Company Bank; or (E) any transaction
which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing
transactions, or any combination of the foregoing.

  



   

 | 57| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  

For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona fide,
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (i) that if consummated would result in a
third party (or, in the case of a direct merger between such third party and
Company, Company Bank or any other Subsidiary of Company, the shareholders of
such third party) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the
outstanding Company Common Stock or more than 50% of the assets of Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities and (ii) that Company Board reasonably determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside
legal counsel, (A) is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into
account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal,
including all conditions contained therein and the person making such
Acquisition Proposal, and (B) taking into account any changes to this
Agreement proposed by Buyer in response to such Acquisition Proposal, as
contemplated by paragraph (c) of this Section 5.09, and all financial, legal,
regulatory and other aspects of such takeover proposal, including all
conditions contained therein and the person making such proposal, is more
favorable to the shareholders of Company from a financial point of view than
the Merger.

  



  

(b)  Notwithstanding Section 5.09(a) or any other provision of this
Agreement, prior to the date of the Company Meeting, Company may take any of
the actions described in Section 5.09(a) if, but only if, (A) Company has
received a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of this Section 5.09; (B) the Company Board reasonably
determines in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of its outside financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that (1)
such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal and (2) the failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and (C) prior to
furnishing or affording access to any information or data with respect to
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, Company receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with
terms no less favorable to Company than those contained in the
confidentiality agreement with Buyer (it being understood that nothing therein
shall have the effect of a standstill provision). Company shall promptly
provide to Buyer any non-public information regarding Company or its
Subsidiaries provided to any other Person which was not previously provided
to Buyer, such additional information to be provided no later than the date of
provision of such information to such other party.

  



  

(c)  Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Buyer
in writing if any proposals or offers are received by, any information is
requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated
or continued with, Company or the Company Representatives, in each case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the
name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such
proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to
such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion,
providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic
communications) except to the extent that such materials constitute
confidential information of the party making such offer or proposal under an
effective confidentiality agreement). Company agrees that it shall keep Buyer
informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and terms of any

   

 | 58| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions
(including any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or
request).

  



  

(d)  Subject to Section 5.09(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, or
publicly propose to withdraw, change, qualify, amend or modify, in a manner
adverse in any respect to the interest of Buyer, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), or take
any other action or make any other public statement inconsistent with, the
Company Recommendation, fail to reaffirm the Company Recommendation within
five (5) Business Days following a request by Buyer, or make any public
statement, filing or release, in connection with the Company Meeting or
otherwise, inconsistent with the Company Recommendation (it being understood
that taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal shall be considered an adverse modification of the Company
Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) resolve to take, or
publicly announce an intention to take, any of the foregoing actions (each of
(i), (ii) or (iii) a "Company Subsequent Determination"); or (iv) enter into
(or cause Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other agreement (A)
related to any Acquisition Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement
entered into in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.09(b)) or (B)
requiring Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(e)  Notwithstanding Section 5.09(d), prior to the date of the Company
Meeting, the Company Board may make a Company Subsequent Determination after
the fifth (5th) Business Day following Buyer's receipt of a notice (the
"Notice of Superior Proposal") from Company advising Buyer that the Company
Board has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
that it received (that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.09)
constitutes a Superior Proposal if, but only if, (i) the Company Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with and having considered the
advice of outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to
take such actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law (it being understood that the initial determination under this
clause (i) will not be considered a Company Subsequent Determination), (ii)
during the five (5) Business Day period after receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal by Buyer (the "Notice Period"), Company and the Company
Board shall have cooperated and negotiated in good faith with Buyer to make
such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as would enable Company to proceed with the Company
Recommendation without a Company Subsequent Determination;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall not have any obligation to propose any
adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and (iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into account
any such adjusted, modified or amended terms, if any, as may have been
proposed by Buyer since its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal,
the Company Board has again in good faith made the determination (A) in
clause (i) of this _Section 5.09(e)_ and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions
to the Superior Proposal, Company shall

   

 | 59| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal to Buyer and again
comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.09(e)_ , except that the
Notice Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days.

  



  

(f)  Notwithstanding any Company Subsequent Determination, this Agreement
shall be submitted to Company's shareholders at the Company Meeting for the
purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and nothing contained herein shall
be deemed to relieve Company of such obligation; _provided_ , _however_
, that if the Company Board shall have made a Company Subsequent
Determination with respect to a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board may
recommend approval of such Superior Proposal by the shareholders of Company
and may submit this Agreement to Company's shareholders without
recommendation, in which event the Company Board shall communicate the basis
for its recommendation of such Superior Proposal and the basis for its lack
of a recommendation with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby to Company's shareholders in the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto.

  



  

(g)  Nothing contained in this Section 5.09 shall prohibit Company or the
Company Board from complying with Company's obligations required under Rule
14d-5 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such disclosure relating to an Acquisition Proposal
(other than issuing a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed a
change in the Company Recommendation unless the Company Board reaffirms the
Company Recommendation in such disclosure, in which case, for the avoidance
of doubt, such disclosure will not be considered a Company Subsequent
Determination.

  



  

Section 5.10. _Indemnification_.

  



  

(a)  For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, and
in any event subject to the provisions of _Section 5.10(b)(iii)_ , Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless the present and former directors and
officers of Company and Company Bank (the "Indemnified Parties"), against all
costs or expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, or liabilities incurred in connection with any actual
or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative arising out of actions or
omissions of such persons in the course of performing their duties for
Company or Company Bank or any of their respective subsidiaries occurring at
or before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) (each a "Claim"), to the same extent as such persons have the
right to be indemnified pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of Company in effect on the date of this Agreement, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and in connection with any such Claim promptly
advance expenses from time to time as incurred, to the same extent as such
persons have the right to expense advancement pursuant to the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Company in effect on the date of this Agreement,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, _provided_ , the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides a reasonable and

   

 | 60| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

customary undertaking (which shall not include posting of any collateral) to
repay such advances, if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification.

  



  

(b)  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 5.10 shall promptly notify Buyer upon learning of any Claim,
_provided_ that, failure to so notify shall not affect the obligation of
Buyer under this Section 5.10, unless, and only to the extent that, Buyer is
materially prejudiced in the defense of such Claim as a consequence. In the
event of any such Claim (whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time), (i) (A) Buyer shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof and Buyer shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses or other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, unless such
Indemnified Party is advised in writing by counsel that the defense of such
Indemnified Party by Buyer would create an actual or potential conflict of
interest (in which case, Buyer shall not be obligated to reimburse or
indemnify any Indemnified Party for the expenses of more than one such
separate counsel for all Indemnified Parties, in addition to one local
counsel in the jurisdiction where defense of any Claim has been or is to be
asserted), and (B) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of
any such matter, (ii) Buyer shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent and Buyer shall not settle any Claim without
such Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (iii) Buyer shall have no
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if such indemnification would
be in violation of any applicable federal or state banking Laws or
regulations, or in the event that a federal or state banking agency or a court
of competent jurisdiction shall determine that indemnification of an
Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Laws and regulations, whether or not related to banking Laws.

  



  

(c)  For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Buyer will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to purchase and provide director's
and officer's liability insurance (herein, "DandO Insurance") that serves to
reimburse the present and former officers and directors of Company or its
Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from acts and omissions occurring
before the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby),
which insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and
contain terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties,
as that coverage currently provided by Company, _provided that_ , if Buyer is
unable to maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this _Section 5.10_ ,
Buyer will provide as much comparable insurance as is reasonably available
(subject to the limitations described below in this _Section 5.10(c))_ ; and
_provided, further,_ that officers and directors of Company or its
Subsidiaries may be required to make application and provide customary
representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO Insurance for the
purpose of obtaining such insurance. In no event shall Buyer be required to
expend for such tail insurance a premium amount in excess of an amount equal
to 200% of the annual premium paid by Company for DandO Insurance in effect as
of the date of this Agreement (the "Maximum DandO Tail Premium"). If the
aggregate cost of such tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium,
Buyer shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate tail insurance
policy with the greatest coverage available for an

   

 | 61| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

aggregate cost not exceeding the Maximum DandO Tail Premium for, in the case of
a tail insurance policy, the aggregate Maximum DandO Tail Premium for the
6-year period). At the option of Company, prior to the Effective Time and in
lieu of the foregoing insurance coverage, Company may, purchase a tail policy
for directors' and officers' liability insurance on the terms described in
this Section 5.10(c) (including subject to the aggregate Maximum DandO
Tail Premium, except if one or more directors elects to pay for any excess
over such amount) and fully pay for such 6-year policy prior to the Effective
Time, in which event Buyer's obligations under this Section 5.10(c) shall be
fully satisfied. If such prepaid tail policy has been obtained by Company
prior to the Effective Time, Buyer will not, and will not permit any of its
Affiliates to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to result in
the cancellation or modification of such policy.

  



  

(d)  If Buyer or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate
with or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and assets to
any individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer
and its Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
5.10.

  



  

(e)  These rights shall survive consummation of the Merger and are intended
to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party. After the
Effective Time, the obligations of Buyer under this Section 5.10 shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party unless the affected Indemnified Party shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification. If any Indemnified Party
makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses under this
Section 5.10 that is denied by Buyer, and a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such indemnification or
advancement of expense, in whole or in part, then Buyer or the Surviving
Entity shall pay such Indemnified Party's costs and expenses, including legal
fees and expenses, incurred in connection with enforcing such claim against
Buyer.

  



  

(f)  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and officers'
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective
directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that
the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.10 is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  



  

Section 5.11. _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

  



  

(a)  Employees of Company and Company Bank shall be retained as "at will"
employees after the Effective Time as employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank. In
addition, Company and Company Bank agree, upon Buyer's reasonable request, to
facilitate discussions between Buyer and Company Employees a reasonable time
in advance of the Closing Date regarding employment, consulting or other
arrangements to be effective prior to or following the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, any interaction

   

 | 62| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

between Buyer and Company Employees shall be coordinated by Company or
Company Bank.

  



  

(b)  Company Employees (other than those listed in Company Disclosure
Schedule 5.11 who are parties to an employment, change-of-control or other
type of agreement which provides for severance) as of the date of the
Agreement who remain employed by Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Controlled Group Members as of the Effective Time, who become employees of
Buyer Bank at the Effective Time and whose employment is terminated by Buyer
or Buyer Bank (absent termination for cause as determined by the employer)
within one hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall receive
severance pay in accordance with Buyer's standard practices (which may
include a severance agreement and general release of claims to be provided by
the terminated employee) equal to one (1) week of base weekly pay for each
completed year of employment service commencing with any such employee's most
recent hire date with Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group
Members and ending with such employee's termination date with Buyer, with a
minimum payment equal to four (4) weeks of base pay and a maximum payment
equal to twelve (12) weeks of base pay (unless otherwise agreed in a separate
written agreement between such employee and Buyer Bank). Subject to the terms
and execution of the severance agreement and general release of claims
by such employee, such severance payment will be made in accordance with the
terms stated in the severance document and such severance payments will be in
lieu of any severance pay plans that may be in effect at Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members prior to the Effective Time. No
officer or employee of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group
Members is, or shall be, entitled to receive duplicative severance payments
and benefits under (i) an employment or severance agreement; (ii) a severance
or change-of-control plan; (iii) this Section 5.11; or (iv) any other program
or arrangement.

  



  

(c)  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, not later than ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Company shall take all action
required to (i) cause any Company Benefit Plan that has liabilities in respect
of its participants, to be fully funded to the extent required under
applicable Law; (ii) terminate all such plans effective immediately prior to
Closing (unless directed otherwise by Buyer or Buyer Bank); and (iii)
commence the process to pay out any vested benefits thereunder
to participating and eligible Company Employees in such form or forms as
Company or Company Bank elects and as permitted or required under applicable
Law. Distributions of benefits under any profit sharing plan of Company or
Company Bank shall occur in accordance with such plan's terms, and a
participant in such plan will be allowed to take, at the participant's option:
(x) a direct distribution from such plan, (y) a rollover to an Individual
Retirement Account, or (z) a rollover to a tax qualified retirement plan of
Buyer or Buyer Bank to the extent the plan sponsored by Buyer or Buyer Bank
accepts rollover contributions, if such participant is employed by Buyer or
Buyer Bank.

  



  

(d)  For any Company Benefit Plan terminated for which there is a comparable
Buyer Benefit Plan of general applicability, Company Employees who are
retained by Buyer or Buyer Bank shall be entitled to participate in Buyer
Benefit Plans to the same extent as similarly-situated employees of Buyer or
Buyer Bank (it being understood that

   

 | 63| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

inclusion of Company Employees in the Buyer Benefit Plans may occur at
different times with respect to different plans). To the extent
allowable under any of such plans, Company Employees shall be given credit
for prior service or employment with Company or Company Bank (as well as
service with any predecessor employer) for all purposes, including for
purposes of determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits,
vesting and benefit plan accruals (other than benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan); _provided _ that the foregoing shall not apply to the
extent that it would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period
of service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer may amend or terminate any
Buyer Benefit Plan at any time in its sole discretion.

  



  

(e)  Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such
plan to (i) waive any pre-existing condition limitations to the extent such
conditions are covered under the applicable medical, health, or dental plans
of Buyer or Buyer Bank, (ii) subject to approval from Buyer's insurance
carrier, if required, provide full credit under such plans for any deductible
incurred by the employees and their beneficiaries during the portion of the
calendar year prior to such participation, and (iii) waive any waiting period
limitation or evidence of insurability requirement which would otherwise be
applicable to such employee on or after the Effective Time, in each case to
the extent such employee had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous plan prior to the Effective Time for the plan year in
which the Effective Time occurs.

  



  

(f)  Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in this
Section 5.11, Buyer shall honor, and Buyer shall be obligated to perform, all
employment, severance, deferred compensation, retirement or "change-in-
control" agreements, plans or policies of Company or Company Bank, but only if
such obligations, rights, agreements, plans or policies are set forth in
_Company Disclosure Schedule 5.11(f)_. Buyer acknowledges that the
consummation of the Merger and Bank Merger will constitute a "change-in-
control" of Company and Company Bank for purposes of any benefit plans,
agreements and arrangements of Company and Company Bank. Nothing herein
shall limit the ability of Buyer or Buyer Bank to amend or terminate any of
the Company Benefit Plans or Buyer Benefit Plans in accordance with their
terms at any time, subject to vested rights of employees and directors that
may not be terminated pursuant to the terms of such Company Benefit Plans.

  



  

(g)  Nothing in this Section 5.11, expressed or implied, is intended to
confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Section 5.11. Without limiting the foregoing, no
provision of this Section 5.11 will create any third party beneficiary rights
in any current or former employee, director or consultant of Company or
its Subsidiaries or Controlled Group Members, any beneficiary or dependent
thereof, or any collective bargaining representative thereof, in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment), compensation, terms and
conditions of employment and/or benefits or any other matter. Nothing in this
Section 5.11 is intended (i) to amend any Company Benefit Plan or any Buyer
Benefit Plan, (ii) interfere with Buyer's right from and after the Closing
Date to amend or terminate any Company Benefit Plan that is not terminated
prior to the Effective Time or Buyer Benefit Plan, (iii) interfere with
Buyer's right from and after the Effective Time to terminate the

   

 | 64| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

employment or provision of services by any director, employee, independent
contractor or consultant or (iv) interfere with Buyer's indemnification
obligations set forth in Section 5.10.

  



  

Section 5.12. _Notification of Certain Changes_. Buyer and Company
shall promptly advise the other party of any change or event having, or which
could reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect or which it
believes would, or which could reasonably be expected to, cause or constitute
a material breach of any of its or its respective Subsidiaries'
representations, warranties or covenants contained herein, which
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate,
to the failure of a condition in Article 6 to be satisfied on the Closing
Date, _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance with the
foregoing with respect to any change or event shall not be deemed to
constitute a violation of this Section 5.12, or otherwise constitute a breach
of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case
unless the underlying change or event would independently result in a failure
of any of the conditions set forth in Section 6.02 or Section 6.03 to be
satisfied on the Closing Date.

  



  

Section 5.13. _Transition; Informational Systems Conversion_. From and
after the date hereof, Buyer and Company shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to facilitate the integration of Company with the business
of Buyer following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan for the conversion of the
data processing and related electronic informational systems of Company and
each of its Subsidiaries (the "Informational Systems Conversion") to those
used by Buyer after the Closing Date, which planning shall include, but not
be limited to, (a) discussion of third-party service provider arrangements of
Company and each of its Subsidiaries; (b) non-renewal or changeover, after the
Effective Time, of personal property leases and software licenses used by
Company and each of its Subsidiaries in connection with the systems
operations; (c) retention of outside consultants and additional employees to
assist with the conversion; (d) outsourcing, as appropriate after the
Effective Time, of proprietary or self-provided system services; and (e) any
other actions necessary and appropriate to facilitate the conversion, as soon
as practicable following the Effective Time. Buyer shall promptly reimburse
Company on request for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees,
expenses or charges that Company may incur as a result of taking, at the
request of Buyer, any action prior to the Effective Time to facilitate the
Informational Systems Conversion. Company shall have no obligation to
take any action under this Section 5.13 that, after consultation with Buyer
regarding Company's concerns in the matter, would reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely impact it if the Effective Time does not occur.

  



  

Section 5.14. _No Control of Other Party 's Business_. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the
right to control or direct the operations of Company or its Subsidiaries
prior to the Effective Time, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall
give Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of Buyer or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time. Prior to
the Effective Time, each of Company and Buyer shall exercise, consistent with

and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

(a)  No later than forty-five (45) Business Days after the date hereof,
Company shall cooperate with and grant access to an environmental consulting
firm selected and paid for by Company and reasonably acceptable to Buyer (the
"Environmental Consultant"), during normal business hours (or at such other
times as may be agreed to by Company), to any owned property set forth in
_Company Disclosure Schedule 3.31(a)_, for the purpose of conducting an ASTM
Phase I and an asbestos and lead base paint survey as it relates to providing
an environmental site assessment to determine whether any such property may
be impacted by a "recognized environmental condition," as that term is defined
by ASTM;  _provided_ , that with respect to commercial OREO property, Company
shall be obligated to obtain a Phase I only as may be specifically requested
by Buyer after Buyer shall have had an opportunity to perform reasonable
diligence with respect to such commercial OREO property. Each Phase I
(including the asbestos and lead base paint surveys) shall be delivered in
counterpart copies to Buyer and Company, and will include customary language
allowing both Buyer and Company to rely upon its findings and conclusions.
The Environmental Consultant will provide a draft of any Phase I to Company
and Buyer for review and comment prior to the finalization of such report. If
Company or Company Bank has ASTM Phase I reports for any property set forth in
_Company Disclosure Schedule 3.31(a)_ that are dated as of a date that is
within one (1) year before the date of this Agreement, then Company or
Company Bank may deliver such reports to Buyer in lieu of the obligations set
forth in this Section 5.15(a) with respect to that property.

  



  

(b)  To the extent the final version of any Phase I identifies any
"recognized environmental condition," Company shall cooperate with and grant
access to the Environmental Consultant, during normal business hours (or at
such other times as may be agreed by Company), to the property covered by
such Phase I for the purpose of conducting a Phase II limited site
assessment, including subsurface investigation of soil, soil vapor, and
groundwater, designed to further investigate and evaluate any
"recognized environmental condition" identified in the Phase I, the cost of
which shall be shared equally between Buyer and Company.

  



  

(c) Where any Phase I, asbestos or lead base paint survey identifies the
presence or potential presence of radon, asbestos containing materials, mold,
microbial matter, or polychlorinated biphenyls ("Non-scope Issues"), Company
shall cooperate with and grant access to the Environmental Consultant, during
normal business hours (or at such other times as may be agreed by Company) to
the property covered by such Phase I, for the purpose of conducting surveys
and sampling of indoor air and building materials designed to investigate
such identified Non-scope Issue, paid for by Company.

  



  

(d)  Any work conducted by the Environmental Consultant pursuant to
subsections (b) and (c) ("Additional Environmental Assessment") will be
pursuant to a scope of work prepared by the Environmental Consultant and
reasonably acceptable to Company and Buyer. The reports of any Additional
Environmental Assessment will be given directly to Buyer and to Company
by the Environmental Consultant.

  



   

 | 66| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

  

(e)  To the extent that Buyer identified any past or present events,
conditions or circumstances that would require further investigation,
remedial or cleanup action under Environmental Laws, Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to take and complete any such reporting,
remediation or other response actions prior to Closing; provided, however,
that, to the extent any such response actions have not been completed prior
to Closing ("Unresolved Response Action"), Company shall include the amount
of the costs expected to be incurred by the Surviving Entity on or after the
Closing Date, as determined by an independent third party with recognized
expertise in environmental clean-up matters, to fully complete all Unresolved
Response Actions in determining its Closing Consolidated Net Book Value.

orally and in writing of any actual or threatened shareholder litigation
against Company and/or the members of the Company Board related to this
Agreement or the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

and consider in good faith the views of Buyer in connection with, any
proposed written or oral response to such shareholder litigation; (ii) furnish
Buyer's outside legal counsel with all non-privileged information and
documents which outside counsel may reasonably request in connection with such
shareholder litigation; (iii) consult with Buyer regarding the defense or
settlement of any such shareholder litigation, shall give due
consideration to Buyer's advice with respect to such shareholder litigation
and shall not settle any such litigation prior to such consultation and
consideration; provided, however, that Company shall not settle any such
shareholder litigation if such settlement requires the payment of money
damages, without the written consent of Buyer (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless the payment of any such damages by
Company is reasonably expected by Company, following consultation with outside
counsel, to be fully covered (disregarding any deductible to be paid by
Company) under Company's existing director and officer insurance policies,
including any tail policy.

  



  

Section 5.17. _Director Resignations_. Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to Buyer resignations of all the

Buyer and Buyer Bank, respectively. Without limiting the foregoing, senior
officers of Company and Buyer shall meet from time to time as Buyer may
reasonably request, and in any event not less frequently than monthly, to
review the financial and operational affairs of Company and its Subsidiaries,

with the understanding that, notwithstanding any other provision contained in
this Agreement, neither Buyer nor Buyer Bank shall under any circumstance be
permitted to exercise control of Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to
the Effective Time. Company shall permit representatives of Buyer Bank to be

estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and
levels of reserves) so as to be applied, on a basis that is consistent with
that of Buyer. In order to promote a more efficient and orderly integration
of operation of Company Bank with Buyer Bank, Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause Company Bank, or any of its Subsidiaries, to sell
or otherwise divest itself of such Company Investment Securities and loans as
are identified by Buyer and agreed to in writing between Company and Buyer
from time to time prior to the Closing Date, such identification to include a
statement as to Buyer's business reasons for such divestitures, if requested.

necessary to cause any such amendments, modifications or terminations to
become effective prior to, or immediately upon, the Closing, and shall
cooperate with Buyer and use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate specific provisions that may be requested by Buyer in connection
with any such amendment, modification or termination.

  



  

(e)  Subject to _Section 5.18(b)_ , Buyer and Company shall cooperate (i)
to minimize any potential adverse impact to Buyer under Financial Accounting

Combinations), and (ii) to maximize potential benefits to Buyer and its
Subsidiaries under Code Section 382 in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each case consistent with GAAP, the rules
and regulations of the SEC and applicable banking Laws and regulations.

  



  

(f)  From and after the date hereof, Company shall, upon Buyer's reasonable
request, introduce Buyer and its representatives to suppliers of Company and

that it expects to materially exceed its budget for Company Expenses.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.19, Company shall
not incur any investment banking, brokerage, finders or other similar
financial advisory fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement other than those expressly set forth in _Company Disclosure

reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization within

Section 7.02. _Termination Fee; Liquidated Damages_.

  



  

(a)  In recognition of the efforts, expenses and other opportunities
foregone by Buyer while structuring and pursuing the Merger, Company shall
pay to Buyer a termination fee equal to $10.0 million ("Termination Fee"), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified by Buyer
in the event of any of the following: (i) in the event Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(g), Company shall pay Buyer
the Termination Fee within two (2) Business Days after receipt of Buyer's
notification of such termination; and (ii) in the event that after the date
of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, an
Acquisition Proposal shall have been made known to senior management of
Company or has been made directly to its shareholders generally (and not
withdrawn) or any Person shall have publicly announced (and not withdrawn) an
Acquisition Proposal with respect to Company and (A) thereafter this
Agreement is terminated by either Buyer or Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(c) or Section 7.01(f) (without the Requisite Company Shareholder
Approval having been obtained) or if this Agreement is terminated by Buyer
pursuant to Section 7.01(d) or Section 7.01(e), and (B) prior to the date
that is twelve (12) months

   

 | 75| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

after the date of such termination, Company enters into any agreement to
consummate, or consummates an Acquisition Transaction (whether or not the
Acquisition Transaction relates to the same Acquisition Proposal as that
referred to above), then Company shall, on the earlier of the date it enters
into such agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay
Buyer the Termination Fee, _provided_ , that for purposes of this Section
7.02(a)(ii), all references in the definition of Acquisition Transaction to
"20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

  



  

(b)  The parties hereto agree and acknowledge that if Buyer terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(d) or Section 7.01(e) by reason of
Company's or Company Bank's material breach of the provisions of this
Agreement contemplated by Section 7.01(d) or Section 7.01(e) that is not
timely cured as provided in such sections, the actual damages sustained by
Buyer, including the expenses incurred by Buyer preparatory to entering into
this Agreement and in connection with the performance of its obligations
under this Agreement, would be significant and difficult to ascertain, gauged
by the circumstances existing at the time this Agreement is executed, and that
in lieu of Buyer being required to pursue its damage claims in costly
litigation proceedings in such event, the parties agree that Company shall pay
a reasonable estimate of the amount of such damages, which the parties agree
is the sum of $1,000,000 (the "Liquidated Damages Payment"), as liquidated
damages to Buyer, which payment is not intended as a penalty, within two (2)
Business Days after Buyer's notification of such termination. Any payment
made under this Section 7.02(b) shall reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis any
payment that may be due under Section 7.02(a).

  



  

(c)  Company and Buyer each agree that the agreements contained in this
Section 7.02 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Buyer would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if Company fails promptly to pay any amounts due
under this Section 7.02, Company shall pay interest on such amounts from the
date payment of such amounts were due to the date of actual payment at the
rate of interest equal to the sum of (i) the rate of interest published from
time to time in _The Wall Street Journal_ ,  _Eastern Edition_ (or any
successor publication thereto), designated therein as the prime rate on the
date such payment was due, plus (ii) 200 basis points, together with the
costs and expenses of Buyer (including reasonable legal fees and
expenses) reasonably incurred in connection with such suit.

  



  

(d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the parties agree that if Company pays or causes to be paid to Buyer or to
Buyer Bank the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 7.02(a), or, if
applicable, the Liquidated Damages Payment in accordance with
Section 7.02(b), neither Company nor Company Bank (nor any successor in
interest, Affiliate, shareholder, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of Company or Company Bank) will have any further
obligations or liabilities to Buyer or Buyer Bank with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the payment
of such amounts shall be Buyer's sole and exclusive remedy against Company,
Company Bank and their respective Affiliates, Representatives or
successors in interest. For the avoidance of

  



    

 | 76| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

doubt, the parties agree that the fee payable under Section 7.02(a) shall not
be required to be paid more than once.

  



  

Section 7.03. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 7.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any party (or any shareholder, director, officer,
employee, agent, consultant or representative of such party or any of its
Affiliates) to the other party hereto, except as provided in Section 7.02(d);
provided that nothing contained in this Agreement shall limit either party's
rights to recover any liabilities or damages arising out of the other party's
willful breach of any provision of this Agreement. The provisions of this
Section 7.03 and Sections 5.20, 7.02, 9.03 and 9.04 shall survive
any termination hereof pursuant to Section 7.01.

of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. Signatures delivered by facsimile
or by electronic data file shall have the same effect as originals.

  



  

Section 9.12. _Disclosure Schedules_. The parties hereto agree that any
reference in a particular Section of either the Company Disclosure Schedule or
the Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to (or,
as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) the representations
and warranties or covenants, as applicable, of the relevant party that are
contained in the corresponding Section of this Agreement and any other
representations, warranties or covenants of such party that are contained in
this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception
to (or a disclosure for purposes of) such representations, warranties and
covenants would be readily apparent to a reasonable person who has read that
reference and such representations, warranties or covenants without any
independent knowledge on the part of the reader regarding the matter(s) so
disclosed. The mere inclusion of an item in either the Company Disclosure
Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation,
warranty or covenant shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

Exhibit A

  



  

FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT

  



  

THIS VOTING AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is dated as of November 9, 2015,
by and between the undersigned holder (" _Shareholder_ ") of common stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of C1 Financial, Inc., a Florida corporation ("
_Company_ "), and Bank of the Ozarks, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ("
_Buyer_ "). All capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement (defined below).

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer, Buyer's
wholly owned bank subsidiary, Bank of the Ozarks, an Arkansas state banking
corporation (" _Buyer Bank_ "), Company and Company's wholly owned bank
subsidiary, C1 Bank (" _Company Bank_ "), a Florida state bank, are entering
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as such agreement may be subsequently
amended or modified in accordance with the terms thereof, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, and on the terms and conditions set forth
therein, (i) Company will merge with and into Buyer, with Buyer as the
surviving entity (the " _Merger_ ") and (ii) Company Bank will merge with and
into Buyer Bank, with Buyer Bank as the surviving entity, and at the
Effective Time each outstanding share of Company Common Stock (except as
provided in Section 2.01(c) of the Merger Agreement) will be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article 2 of
the Merger Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, Shareholder beneficially owns and/or has, directly or indirectly,
[the sole voting power with respect to] the number of shares of Company
Common Stock as indicated on the signature page of this Agreement under the
heading "Total Number of Shares of Company Common Stock Subject to this
Agreement" (such shares, together with any additional shares of Company Common
Stock subsequently acquired by Shareholder during the term of this Agreement,
including through the exercise of any stock option or other equity award,
warrant or similar instrument, being referred to collectively as the "
_Shares_ "); and

  



  

WHEREAS, it is a material inducement to the willingness of Buyer to enter
into the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of, and as a material inducement to, Buyer
entering into the Merger Agreement and proceeding with the transactions
contemplated thereby, and in consideration of the expenses incurred and to be
incurred by Buyer in connection therewith, Shareholder and Buyer agree as
follows:

  



  

 _Section 1_. _Agreement to Vote Shares_. Shareholder agrees that, while
this Agreement is in effect, at any meeting of shareholders of Company,
however called, or at any adjournment thereof, or in any other circumstances
in which Shareholder is entitled to vote, consent or give any other approval
relating to the Merger, except as otherwise agreed to in writing in advance by
Buyer, Shareholder shall:

  



    

A-1

 



     | (a)| appear  at each such meeting in person or by proxy, or
otherwise cause the Shares to be counted  as present thereat for purposes of
calculating a quorum; and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| vote  (or cause to be voted), in person or by proxy, all the
Shares, (i) in favor of adoption  and approval of the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby (including  any amendments or
modifications of the terms thereof approved by the board of directors  of
Company and adopted in accordance with the terms thereof and hereof); (ii) in
favor  of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such meeting, if necessary, to
solicit additional  proxies to approve the Merger Agreement; (iii) in favor
of any proposal relating to an  advisory vote on executive compensation, as
may be required under Rule 14a-21(c) under  the Exchange Act; (iv) against
any action or agreement that would result in a material  breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement  of
Company contained in the Merger Agreement or of Shareholder contained in this
Agreement;  and (v) against any Acquisition Proposal or any other action,
agreement or transaction  that is intended, or could reasonably be expected,
to impede, interfere or be inconsistent  with, delay, postpone, discourage or
materially and adversely affect consummation of  the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement or this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Shareholder further agrees not to vote or execute any written consent to
rescind or amend in any manner any prior vote or written consent, as a
shareholder of Company, to approve or adopt the Merger Agreement unless this
Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

  



  

 _Section 2_.  _No Transfers_. While this Agreement is in effect,
Shareholder agrees not to, directly or indirectly, sell, transfer, pledge,
assign or otherwise dispose of, or enter into any contract option, commitment
or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer,
pledge, assignment or other disposition of, any of the Shares, except the
following transfers shall be permitted: (a) transfers by will, intestacy or
operation of Law (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement), in which
case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (b) transfers pursuant to any
pledge agreement, subject to the pledgee agreeing in writing, prior to such
transfer, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, (c) transfers
in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including transfers to
relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to each transferee
agreeing in writing, prior to such transfer, to be bound by the terms of this
Agreement, and (d) such transfers as Buyer may otherwise permit in its sole
discretion. Any transfer or other disposition in violation of the terms
of this Section 2 shall be null and void.

  



  

 _Section 3_. _Representations and Warranties of Shareholder_.
Shareholder represents and warrants to and agrees with Buyer as follows:

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



     | (a)| Shareholder  has all requisite capacity and authority to
enter into and perform his, her or its obligations  under this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| This  Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
Shareholder, and assuming the due authorization,  execution and delivery by
Buyer, constitutes the valid and legally binding obligation  of Shareholder
enforceable against Shareholder in accordance with its terms, subject  to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar  laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
rights and to  general equity principles. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (c)| The  execution and delivery of this Agreement by Shareholder
does not, and the performance  by Shareholder of his, her or its obligations
hereunder and the consummation by Shareholder  of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, violate or conflict with, or constitute  a
default under, any agreement, instrument, contract or other obligation of
Shareholder  or any order, arbitration award, judgment or decree to which
Shareholder is a party or  by which Shareholder is bound, or any statute,
rule or regulation to which Shareholder  is subject or, in the event that
Shareholder is a corporation, partnership, trust or  other entity, any
charter, bylaw or other organizational document of Shareholder. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (d)| Shareholder  is the record and beneficial owner of (or is the
trustee that is the record holder of  Shares in a trust whose beneficiaries
are the beneficial owners of such Shares), and  has good title to all of the
Shares, [and except as previously disclosed to Buyer] the  Shares are owned
free and clear of any liens, security interests, charges or other
encumbrances.  The Shares do not include shares over which Shareholder
exercises control in a fiduciary  capacity for any other person or entity
that is not an Affiliate of Shareholder, and  no representation by
Shareholder is made with respect thereto. Shareholder has the right  to vote
the Shares, and none of the Shares is subject to any voting trust or other
agreement,  arrangement or restriction with respect to the voting of the
Shares, except as contemplated  by this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

 _Section 4_.  _No Solicitation_. From and after the date hereof until
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7_ hereof,
Shareholder, in his, her or its capacity as a shareholder of Company, shall
not, nor shall such Shareholder in such capacity authorize any partner,
officer, director, advisor or representative of, such Shareholder or any
of his, her or its affiliates to, (a) initiate, solicit, knowingly induce or
encourage, or knowingly take any action to facilitate the making of, any
inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than, for the avoidance of doubt,
Company's officers, directors, employees and advisers or Buyer) regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any person
(other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Company's officers, directors,
employees and advisers or Buyer) any non-public information or data with
respect to Company or in

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

connection with an Acquisition Proposal, (c) enter into any agreement,
agreement in principle, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or
similar arrangement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (d) solicit
proxies with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or otherwise knowingly
encourage or assist any party in taking or planning any action that would
compete with, restrain or otherwise serve to interfere with or inhibit the
timely consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger
Agreement, or (e) initiate a shareholders' vote or action by consent of
Company's shareholders with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall restrict any action by Company or
Company's Board of Directors permitted under Section 5.09 of the Merger
Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 5_. _Proxy_. Shareholder hereby revokes any proxy previously
granted by Shareholder with respect to the Shares. Subject to the last
sentence of this Section 5, by execution of this Agreement, Shareholder hereby
grants, or agrees to cause the applicable record holder to grant, a revocable
proxy appointing Buyer with full power of substitution, as the Shareholder's
attorney-in-fact and proxy, for and in the Shareholder's name, to be counted
as present, vote, express consent or dissent with respect to the Shares in
the manner contemplated by Section 1 as such proxy or its proxies
or substitutes shall, in their sole discretion, deem proper with respect to
the Shares. The proxy granted by the Shareholder pursuant to this Section 5
is granted in consideration of Buyer entering into this Agreement and the
Merger Agreement and incurring the obligations therein. If the Shareholder
fails for any reason to be counted as present, consent or vote the Shares in
accordance with the requirements of Section 1 (or anticipatorily breaches
such section), then Buyer shall have the right to cause to be
present, consent or vote the Shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holder of such proxy shall not
exercise such proxy on any matter other than as set forth in Section 1. This
proxy shall automatically terminate upon the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms.

  



  

 _Section 6_.  _Specific Performance; Remedies; Attorneys ' Fees_.
Shareholder acknowledges that it is a condition to the willingness of Buyer
to enter into the Merger Agreement that Shareholder execute and deliver this
Agreement and that it will be impossible to measure in money the damage to
Buyer if Shareholder fails to comply with the obligations imposed by
this Agreement and that, in the event of any such failure, Buyer will not
have an adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Shareholder agrees that
injunctive relief or other equitable remedy is the appropriate remedy for any
such failure and will not oppose the granting of such relief on the basis
that Buyer has an adequate remedy at law. Shareholder further agrees that
Shareholder will not seek, and agrees to waive any requirement for, the
securing or posting of a bond in connection with Buyer's seeking or obtaining
such equitable relief. In addition, after discussing the matter with
Shareholder, Buyer shall have the right to inform any third party that Buyer
reasonably believes to be, or to be contemplating, participating with
Shareholder or receiving from Shareholder assistance in violation of this
Agreement, of the terms of this Agreement and of the rights of Buyer
hereunder, and that participation by any such persons with Shareholder in
activities in violation of Shareholder's agreement with Buyer set forth in
this Agreement may give rise to claims by Buyer against such third party.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

 _Section 7_.  _Term of Agreement; Termination_. The term of this
Agreement shall commence on the date hereof. This Agreement may be terminated
at any time prior to consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement by the mutual written agreement of the parties hereto, and
shall be automatically terminated upon the earlier to occur of (i) the
Effective Time, (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement or (iii) the
amendment of the Merger Agreement in any manner materially adverse to
Shareholder. Upon such termination, no party shall have any further
obligations or liabilities hereunder; _provided, however_ , that such
termination shall not relieve any party from liability for any willful and
intentional breach of this Agreement prior to such termination and the
provisions of this Section 7 and Section 12 and 13 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 8_. _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement supersedes
all prior agreements, written or oral, among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement among
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may not
be amended, supplemented or modified, and no provisions hereof may be modified
or waived, except by an instrument in writing signed by each party hereto. No
waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of
any other provision hereof by any such party, nor shall any such waiver be
deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

  



  

 _Section 9_. _Severability_. In the event that any one or more
provisions of this Agreement shall for any reason be held invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any
other provisions of this Agreement and the parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to substitute a valid, legal and enforceable
provision which, insofar as practical, implements the purposes and intents of
this Agreement.

  



  

 _Section 10_. _Capacity as Shareholder_. If Shareholder is an
individual, this Agreement shall apply to Shareholder solely in his or her
capacity as a shareholder of Company and it shall not apply in any manner to
Shareholder in his or her capacity, if any, as a director or officer of
Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or
limit in any manner, the Shareholder's actions in his or her capacity, if
any, as a director or officer of Company.

  



  

 _Section 11_.  _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware (except for mandatory effects of Florida or Arkansas law relating to
the Merger or the Bank Merger, as applicable), without regard to the
conflicts of law rules of such state.

  



  

Section 12. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES
AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH
SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF THE
PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF
THIS AGREEMENT. Each of the parties hereto certifies and acknowledges that
(i) no representative, agent or other party has represented, expressly or
otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek
to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each party understands and has
considered the implications of this waiver, (iii) each of the parties makes
this waiver voluntarily and (iv) each of the parties has been induced to
enter into this agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section
12_.

  



  

 _Section 13_. _Waiver of Appraisal Rights; Further Assurances_.
Provided that the Merger is consummated in compliance with the terms of the
Merger Agreement, that the consideration offered pursuant to the Merger is
not less than that specified in the Merger Agreement executed on or about the
date hereof, and that this Agreement has not been terminated in accordance
with its terms, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Shareholder hereby
waives any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the Merger or demand
fair value for his or her Shares in connection with the Merger, in each case,
that Shareholder may have under applicable law. From time to time prior to
the termination of this Agreement, at Buyer's request and without further
consideration, Shareholder shall execute and deliver such additional
documents and take all such further action as may be reasonably necessary or
desirable to effect the actions and consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement to be taken by Shareholder. Shareholder further agrees not
to commence or participate in, and to take all actions necessary to opt out of
any class in any class action with respect to, any claim, derivative or
otherwise, against Buyer, Buyer Bank, Company, Company Bank or any of their
respective successors relating to the negotiation, execution or delivery of
this Agreement or the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.

  



  

 _Section 14_. _Disclosure_. Shareholder hereby authorizes Company and
Buyer to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required by
the Securities and Exchange Commission and in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus
such Shareholder's identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of
Shareholder's obligations under this Agreement.

Exhibit B

  



  

RETENTION AND NON-COMPETE AGREEMENT

  



  

This Retention and Non-Compete Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into as of November 9, 2015 by and between Bank of the Ozarks (the
"Bank"), an Arkansas state banking corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
Bank of the Ozarks, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ("Ozarks"), and Trevor R.
Burgess (the "Executive").

  



  

WHEREAS, Ozarks has agreed to acquire C1 Financial, Inc., a Florida
corporation ("C1"), pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger
being entered concurrently among Ozarks, the Bank, C1, and C1 Bank, a Florida
state bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of C1 (such agreement, as may be
amended from time to time in accordance with its terms, but not taking into
account for purposes hereof any amendment that would adversely affect the
rights or obligations of the Executive hereunder, the "Merger Agreement", and
such acquisition, the "Transaction").

  



  

WHEREAS, the Executive currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer,
President and Director of C1; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Bank desires to employ the Executive and the Executive desires
to render his services to the Bank after the acquisition;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Bank desires to protect its confidential and trade secret
information and to prevent unfair competition; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the Bank and the Executive desire to enter into a retention and non-
compete arrangement the terms and conditions of which are set forth herein.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual terms and
conditions hereof, the Bank and the Executive hereby agree as follows:

  



  

1. _Effectiveness; Employment_. This Agreement shall become effective upon the closing of the Transaction (the day of such closing, the "Effective Date"); provided, that this Agreement shall be null and void ab initio and of no force and effect in the event the Transaction is not consummated for any reason. Effective as of the Effective Date, the Bank (or a subsidiary thereof) shall employ the Executive and the Executive shall accept employment with the Bank (or such subsidiary) upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

  



  

2. _Duties_. During the Retention Period (as defined below in Section 3), the Executive shall be employed as an employee of the Bank to serve as Chief Innovation Officer of Ozarks and the Bank and Florida Market President of the Bank and will have the duties, responsibilities, functions and authority commensurate with those positions. During the Retention Period, the Executive shall render his services in St. Petersburg, Florida.

  



    

B-1

 



    

3. _Service Payment_. The Bank shall pay the Executive $5,700,000 (the "Service Payment") as consideration for the Executive's (i) employment by the Bank for the one-year period following the Transaction (the "Retention Period") and (ii) compliance with the restrictive covenants set forth in Sections 5 and 6 of the Agreement for the three-year period commencing upon the Executive's termination of employment on the earlier of (x) the expiration of the Retention Period and (y) if the employment of the Executive terminates for any reason during the Retention Period, other than by the Bank for Cause (as defined in Section 8(b)) or by the Executive without Good Reason (as defined in Section 8(c)), the effective date of such termination of employment (the "Non-Competition Period" and, together with the Retention Period, the "Relevant Period"). Subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants set forth in Sections 5 and 6(a), the Service Payment shall vest and be paid in quarterly installments commencing on the three-month anniversary of the Effective Date and ending on the four-year anniversary thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, the Service Payment shall be in addition to any payments made to the Executive by C1 pursuant to the Change of Control Agreement entered into between the Executive and C1, dated as of November 9, 2015.

  



  

4. _Reimbursement of Expenses_. Subject to such rules and procedures as from time to time are specified by the Bank, the Bank shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable and customary business expenses, including, but not limited to, travel, cellular phone, professional dues and fees that are approved in advance, and other business expenses reasonably incurred in the performance of his duties under this Agreement.

  



  

5. _Confidentiality/Trade Secrets_. The Executive acknowledges his position with the Bank will be one of the highest trust and confidence both by reason of his position and by reason of his access to and contact with the trade secrets and confidential and proprietary business information, including, but not limited to, data, plans, budgets and customer lists, of the Bank. Both during the Retention Period and thereafter (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not before the Effective Date), the Executive therefore covenants and agrees as follows:

  



  

(a) He shall use his best efforts and exercise utmost diligence to protect
and to safeguard the trade secrets and/or confidential and proprietary
information of the Bank, including, but not limited to, the identity of its
current or prospective customers, suppliers and licensors, its arrangements
with its customers, suppliers and licensors, and its technical, financial and
marketing data, records, compilations of information, processes, programs,
methods, techniques and specifications relating to its customers,
suppliers, licensors, products and services;

  



  

(b) He shall not disclose any of such trade secrets and/or confidential
and proprietary information, except as may be required in the course of his
employment with the Bank or by law; and

  



  

(c) He shall not use, directly or indirectly, for his own benefit or for
the benefit of another, any of such trade secrets and/or confidential and
proprietary information.

  



    

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

All files, records, documents, drawings, specifications, memoranda, notes or
other documents relating to the business of the Bank, whether prepared by the
Executive or otherwise coming into his possession, shall be the exclusive
property of the Bank and shall be delivered to the Bank and not reproduced
and/or retained by the Executive upon termination of his employment for any
reason whatsoever or at any other time upon request of the Bank.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing stated herein or otherwise
prohibits the Executive from reporting a possible violation of law to a
governmental entity or law enforcement, making a disclosure that is protected
under the whistleblower protections of applicable law and/or participating in
a governmental investigation.

  



  

6. _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation and Non-Disparagement_.

  



  

(a) The Executive agrees that, during the Non-Competition Period, the
Executive will not, within the state of Florida, in one or a series of
transactions, own, manage, operate, control, invest or acquire an interest in,
or otherwise engage or participate in the business of commercial banking,
within the state of Florida, in any commercial banking business or other
venture which competes, directly or indirectly, with the Bank, Ozarks or
their affiliates; provided, however, that the Executive may, directly or
indirectly, in one or a series of transactions, own, invest or acquire an
interest in up to five percent (5%) of the capital stock of a company whose
capital stock is traded publicly. For purposes of this Agreement, "commercial
banking" means the business of taking deposits, making secured or unsecured
loans or engaging in any substantial activities in support of or related to
such business.

  



  

(b) The Executive agrees that during the Non-Competition Period he will
not, directly or indirectly, solicit, induce or attempt to induce, or cause
any individual who, on the date of this Agreement or any time thereafter, is
an officer, manager or employee of the Bank or C1 to leave the employ of the
Bank or C1, or in any way materially interfere with the relationship between
the Bank or C1, on the one hand, and any such officer, manager or employee,
on the other hand. In addition, during the Non-Competition Period, the
Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any
customer, supplier, licensee or other business relation of C1, or of the
Bank, to cease doing business with the Bank, or in any way interfere with the
relationship between any such customer, supplier, licensee or business
relation and the Bank.

  



  

(c) The Executive agrees that during the Non-Competition Period he will
not make any false, defamatory or disparaging statements about the Bank,
Ozarks or any of their respective affiliates or the banking business of the
Bank. The Bank agrees to, and will cause its affiliates to, instruct,
promptly after the execution of this Agreement, its directors and officers not
to make any disparaging statements or communications about the Executive.

  



  

7. _Remedies for Breach of Covenants of the Executive_.

  



  

(a) The Bank and the Executive specifically acknowledge and agree that the
foregoing covenants of the Executive in Sections 5 and 6 are reasonable in
content and scope and are given by the Executive and the Bank knowingly,
willingly and voluntarily

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

and for adequate consideration. The Bank and the Executive further
acknowledge and agree that, if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
appropriate authority shall disagree with the parties' foregoing agreement as
to reasonableness, then such court or other authority shall reform or
otherwise modify the foregoing covenants only so far as necessary to be
enforceable.

  



  

(b) The covenants set forth in Sections 5 and 6 shall continue to be
binding upon the Executive and the Bank, notwithstanding the termination of
his employment with the Bank for any reason whatsoever. Such covenants shall
be deemed and construed as separate agreements independent of any other
provisions of this Agreement and any other agreement between the Bank and the
Executive. The existence of any claim or cause of action by the Executive
against the Bank, unless predicated on this Agreement, shall not constitute
a defense to the enforcement by the Bank of any or all such covenants. It is
expressly agreed that the remedy at law for the breach of any such covenant
is inadequate, injunctive relief and specific performance shall be available
to prevent the breach or any threatened breach thereof and that the party
bringing the claim shall not be required to post bond in pursuit of such
claim. For any such claim, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover
its or his attorneys' fees and costs incurred in pursuit of such claim to the
extent permitted by law.

  



  

8. _Termination_. This Agreement (other than Sections 5 and 6, which shall survive any termination hereof for any reason) may be terminated as follows:

  



  

(a) The Bank may terminate this Agreement and the Executive's employment
hereunder at any time, with or without Cause, and if without Cause, upon at
least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Executive. The Executive
may terminate this Agreement and his employment hereunder at any time, for
Good Reason or no reason, upon at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice
to the Bank.

  



  

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean (i) the Executive's
willful and repeated refusal to perform his duties or responsibilities
following written notice from the Bank; it being understood that the failure
to achieve specified results or generally poor Bank performance will not
constitute Cause; (ii) commission by the Executive of embezzlement or
actual fraud in the performance of his duties to the Bank; or (iii) the
Executive's indictment for, conviction of, guilty plea or plea of nolo
contendere to, a felony or any other criminal charge involving moral
turpitude. Whether "Cause" exists shall be determined in the sole and good
faith discretion of the board of directors of the Bank (the
"Board"); provided that any such determination (other than as relating to the
conduct described in clause (iii) above) shall be made pursuant to a
resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of
the members of the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for such
purpose (after reasonable notice is provided to the Executive and the
Executive is given an opportunity, together with counsel, to be heard before
the Board), finding that, in the good faith opinion of the Board, the
Executive is guilty of the conduct that constitutes "Cause", and specifying
the particulars thereof in detail.

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean (i) the Bank
breaches this Agreement in any material respect and fails to cure such breach
within thirty (30) days after Executive delivers written notice and a written
description of such breach to the Bank; (ii) the Bank reduces the Executive's
base annual salary; (iii) the Bank materially diminishes the Executive's
authority, duties, or responsibilities; or (iv) the Executive is transferred
to an office greater than fifteen (15) miles from the current location of the
Executive's office. The Executive shall not be deemed to have resigned for
Good Reason unless and until there is delivered to the Bank's Director of
Human Resources written notice of the Executive's ground for resignation
fully explaining his contention that Good Reason exists for his resignation
and the Director of Human Resources has been provided at least thirty (30)
days following the receipt of this written notice to respond to the
Executive's stated concerns and attempt to cure the same (the "Cure Period").
In the event that the Bank fails to remedy the condition constituting Good
Reason during the applicable Cure Period, the Executive's "separation from
service" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended from time to time, and the rules, regulations and guidance
thereunder (the "Code")) must occur, if at all, within sixty (60) days
following such Cure Period in order for such termination as a result of such
condition to constitute a termination for Good Reason. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, a temporary suspension of the
Executive's duties, authorities, employment or other roles hereunder not in
excess of thirty (30) days by the Board based upon the Board's good faith
judgment that such suspension is warranted pending investigation of any
material allegations relating to the conduct of the Executive or the conduct
of the Bank, which may implicate the Executive, shall not give rise to Good
Reason.

  



  

(d) In the event that the Bank terminates the Executive's employment with
Cause or the Executive voluntarily terminates his employment without Good
Reason, the Bank shall pay the Executive the Service Payment (subject to
Section 8(f)), all accrued and unpaid base annual salary up to the date of
termination, and shall reimburse the Executive for all unreimbursed but
reimbursable expenses incurred by the Executive up to the date of
termination, in accordance with the Bank's reimbursement policy on expense
reimbursement for its officers similarly situated to the Executive, and the
Executive shall not be eligible for or entitled to any further
compensation or benefits from the Bank except for any post-employment
continuation of COBRA benefits elected to be received by the Executive solely
at his own expense.

  



  

(e) In the event that the Bank terminates the Executive's employment
without Cause or the Executive terminates his employment for Good Reason, in
either case during the Retention Period, the Bank shall pay the Executive (i)
the Service Payment (subject to Section 8(f)) and (ii) solely in exchange for
Executive's execution and delivery of the Bank's then standard
separation agreement, which includes, among other obligations, a full release
of claims against the Bank and related entities and persons, within the time
period specified therein, and upon such agreement becoming effective by its
terms, an amount equal to his accrued vacation, all accrued but unpaid base
annual salary and the base annual salary for the remaining period of the
Retention Period in one lump sum as soon as administratively feasible after
the termination. In addition, the Bank shall pay the Executive
all unreimbursed but reimbursable expenses incurred by the

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

Executive up to the date of termination, in accordance with the Bank's
reimbursement policy on expense reimbursement for its officers similarly
situated to the Executive. The Executive shall not be eligible for or entitled
to any further compensation or benefits from the Bank except for any post-
employment continuation of COBRA benefits elected to be received by the
Executive solely at his own expense.

  



  

(f) If a termination of Executive's employment with the Bank occurs for
any reason (including, for the avoidance of doubt, due to (i) the Executive's
death or permanent disability, (ii) a termination by the Bank with or without
Cause or (iii) a termination by the Executive for Good Reason or without Good
Reason) during the Retention Period, the Bank will pay the Executive the
remainder of the Service Payment pursuant to the vesting schedule described
in Section 3 and in consideration of the Executive's fulfillment of his
obligations under Sections 5 and 6; provided that, upon the Executive's
material violation of his obligations under Sections 5 or 6(a) at any time
during the Relevant Period, the Executive shall reimburse all previously paid
amounts of the Service Payment and shall not be entitled to receive any of
the remaining amounts of the Service Payment.

  



  

9. _Section 280G of the Code_.

  



  

(a) If any payment or benefit received by Executive pursuant to this
Agreement (or any payments that the Executive would receive from the Bank or
otherwise in connection with the Transaction) is subject to the excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), then the Executive
shall be entitled to receive an additional payment (a "Gross-Up Payment") in
an amount such that after payment by the Executive of all taxes (including any
interest or penalties imposed with respect to such taxes), including, without
limitation, any income taxes (and any interest and penalties imposed with
respect thereto) and the Excise Tax imposed upon the Gross-Up Payment, the
Executive retains an amount of the Gross-Up Payment equal to the Excise Tax
imposed upon the payments.

  



  

(b) It is possible that, after the determinations and selections made
pursuant to this Section 9, the Executive will receive payments and benefits
(including a Gross-Up Payment) that are, in the aggregate, either more or less
than the limitations provided in Section 9(a) (hereafter referred to as an
"Excess Payment" or "Underpayment", respectively). If it is established,
pursuant to a final determination of a court or an Internal Revenue Service
proceeding that has been finally and conclusively resolved, that an Excess
Payment has been made, then the Executive shall refund the Excess Payment to
the Bank promptly on demand, together with an additional payment in an amount
equal to the product obtained by multiplying the Excess Payment times the
applicable annual federal rate (as determined in and under Section 1274(d) of
the Code) times a fraction whose numerator is the number of days elapsed from
the date of the Executive's receipt of such Excess Payment through the date of
such refund and whose denominator is 365. In the event that it is determined
(x) by a court of competent jurisdiction or (y) by the Accounting Firm (as
defined in Section 9(c) below) upon request by the Executive or the Bank, that
an Underpayment has occurred, the Bank shall pay an amount equal to the
Underpayment to the Executive within ten (10) days of such determination
together with

  



    

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

an additional payment in an amount equal to the product obtained by
multiplying the Underpayment times the applicable annual federal rate (as
determined in and under Section 1274(d) of the Code) times a fraction whose
numerator is the number of days elapsed from the date of the Underpayment
through the date of such payment and whose denominator is 365.

  



  

(c) For purposes of making all determinations required to be made under
this Section 9, (i) the value of any noncash benefits or any deferred payment
or benefit shall be determined by accounting firm or tax counsel selected by
the Bank and reasonably acceptable to the Executive (the "Accounting Firm")
in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G(d)(3) and (4) of the
Code and applicable guidance under Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1, and
U.S. Treasury Department rulings and releases; and (ii) for purposes of
determining the amount of any Gross-Up Payment, the Executive shall be deemed
to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rates applicable to
individuals in the calendar year in which any such Gross-Up Payment is to be
made and deemed to pay state and local income taxes at the highest effective
rates applicable to individuals in the state or locality of the
Executive's residence or place of employment in the calendar year in which
any such Gross-Up Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in
federal income taxes that can be obtained from deduction of such state and
local taxes, taking into account limitations applicable to individuals
subject to federal income tax at the highest marginal rates. All
determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section 9 shall be
final and binding on the Bank and its successors. All fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne solely by the Bank.

  



  

10. _Notices. _ Any notices to be given hereunder by either party to the other may be effected either by personal delivery in writing or by mail, registered or certified, postage prepaid, with return receipt requested. Mailed notices shall be addressed as follows:

severable, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, and the remaining provisions hereof shall remain in full force and
effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom. Furthermore, in lieu of such

exception under Section 409A of the Code shall be paid under the applicable
exception. For purposes of the limitations on nonqualified deferred
compensation under Section 409A of the Code, each payment of
compensation under this Agreement shall be treated as a separate payment of
compensation.

  



  

(d) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement sets forth the entire
understanding of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements or
understandings between the Bank, its predecessors and the Executive, whether
written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Executive has

representatives, successors and assigns. This Agreement may not be assigned by
the Executive, but may be assigned by the Bank to any person or entity that
succeeds to the ownership or operation of the business in which the Executive
is primarily employed by the Bank.

  



    

 | 8| 
---|---|--- 

 



    

(f) _Waiver_. The waiver by either party hereto of a breach of any term
or provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver
of a subsequent breach of the same provision by any party or of the breach of
any other term or provision of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) _Titles_. Titles of the paragraphs herein are used solely for
convenience and shall not be used for interpretation or construing any
