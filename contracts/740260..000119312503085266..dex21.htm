Section 1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware Limited Liability
Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ ") and Title 8 of the Corporations and Associations
Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland (" _Title 8_ " and, together with
the DLLCA, " _Corporate Law_ "), at the Effective Time (as defined below), Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving
entity (the " _Surviving Entity_ ") and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.
Sub and the Company are collectively referred to as the " _Constituent
Entities_."



Section 1.2. Closing. The closing of the Merger (" _Closing_ ") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m. on the first Business Day after satisfaction of the
latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing), unless
another date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the " _Closing
Date_ "); provided, however, that even if all of such conditions have been
satisfied, Parent shall have the right to delay the Closing Date for such
period of time as will allow the Company to set a record date with regard
to a 338 Dividend or REIT Dividend and make payment thereof immediately prior
to the Effective Time, as contemplated by _Section 6.8_ hereof, in compliance
with requirements of Law, rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the

another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. " _Business Day_
" shall mean any day, other than a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday on which

Section 1.3. Effective Time. As soon as practicable following the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ , Sub and the Company
shall file the Certificate of Merger in accordance with Corporate Law, and
shall make all other filings and recordings required under Corporate Law. The
Merger shall become effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") on the date and at
such time as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (or on the date
the Certificate of Merger is accepted for record in accordance with Corporate
Law if not set forth  



 

\- 2 -  therein). The Merger shall have the effects specified in this Agreement, the
Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of Corporate Law.
Unless otherwise agreed, the parties shall cause the Effective Time to occur
on the Closing Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, all of the
property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Sub
shall vest in the Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the

in effect at the Effective Time shall be the constituent documents of the
Surviving Entity.



Section 1.5. Directors and Officers.



(a) The officers of Sub at the Effective Time shall become the initial

accordance with the constituent documents of the Surviving Entity until their

(b) The Company and Parent shall cause T. Richard Riney (or some other person
designated by Parent) to be the initial trustee of the Surviving Entity as of
the Effective Time, to hold office in accordance with the constituent
documents of the Surviving Entity until his or her successor is duly elected

Consideration_ "). If (x) from and after the date hereof, the Company declares
or pays a dividend or distribution to its shareholders (including any 338
Dividend or REIT Dividend), but excluding those dividends and distributions
permitted by clause (ii) of _Section 6.8_ (all such dividends or
distributions, " _Excess Distributions_ "), the Merger Consideration per share
of Company Common Stock shall be reduced by the amount equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing the aggregate amount of Excess Distributions by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (y) the Closing shall not have occurred by May 31, 2004,
the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock shall be increased
by an amount equal to the product of (a) $.72 divided by 365, multiplied by
(b) the number of days that have elapsed from and including June 1, 2004
through but not including the Closing Date.



(ii) As of the Effective Time all such shares of Company Common Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior
to the Effective Time evidenced any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except
the right to receive the Merger Consideration upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with _Section 2.2_. The right of any holder of any
share of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
subject to and reduced by the amount of any withholding that is required under
applicable tax law.



(d) _Rights_. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references herein
to shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to include any accompanying
Rights (as defined herein).



Section 2.2. Exchange of Certificates. __



(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
(the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of Merger Consideration upon
surrender of certificates evidencing Company Common Stock. At the Effective
Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause the Surviving Entity to deposit, with
the Paying Agent amounts in immediately  



 

\- 4 -  available funds sufficient in the aggregate to provide cash necessary to pay
for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "), upon surrender of
Certificates, it being understood that any and all interest earned on funds
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be paid
to Parent.



(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
evidenced outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.1_ , (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor (by mail or made available for collection by
hand if so elected by the surrendering shareholder) the amount of cash
payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore evidenced
by such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , and the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than
the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive upon such
surrender Merger Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of
any Certificate.



(c) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance with
this _Article II_ ; provided, however, that Parent or the Paying Agent may
require the delivery of a reasonable indemnity or bond against any claim that
may be made against the Surviving Entity with respect to such Certificate or
ownership thereof.



(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this  _Article II_ upon
conversion of any  



 

\- 5 - shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
subject, however, to the Surviving Entitys obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time
that may have been declared by the Company on such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date
hereof and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the transfer
books of the Surviving Entity of shares of Company Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any certificates formerly evidencing shares of Company Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.



(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for nine months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this
_Article II_ shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim
for Merger Consideration; provided, however, that Parent may cause the
Surviving Entity to pay such claim for Merger Consideration.



(f) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate has not been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective
Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which Merger Consideration
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Agency),
any such cash in respect of such Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Entity, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.



(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent.



(h) _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts as Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent may be required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the
Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the
shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent.



 

\- 6 - Section 2.3. Stock Plans.



(a) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that, at the
Effective Time, (i) each then outstanding option to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ "), whether granted under any of
the Companys stock option plans referred to in _Section 3.14_ , each as
amended (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ "), or otherwise, and whether or
not then exercisable or vested, shall be canceled and (ii) the Surviving
Entity shall pay to such holders of Company Options an amount in cash with
respect to each such Company Option equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (A) the amount, if any, by which the Merger Consideration exceeds
the exercise price relating to such Company Option, by (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject thereto (such payment to be net of
applicable withholding taxes). The aggregate amount to be paid pursuant to
clause (ii) with respect to all Company Options (assuming that the Merger
Consideration is $12.50) is $1,132,774. Prior to the Effective Time and
contingent upon the consummation of the Merger, the Company shall notify each
holder of a Company Option that (i) all outstanding Company Options that have
not become fully vested prior to the Effective Time shall become fully vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) each such holder may
exercise his or her Company Options prior to the Effective Time or such
Company Options shall be canceled and cashed out in the manner set forth in
clause (ii) above.



(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary to provide that, at the
Effective Time, (i) each then outstanding right that entitles the recipient to
receive credits based on a cash distribution that would have been paid on
Company Common Stock specified in such right, or other award to which it
relates (a " _Distribution Equivalent Right_ "), whether granted under any of
the Companys Stock Plans or otherwise, shall be canceled and (ii) the
Surviving Entity shall pay to the holders of Distribution Equivalent Rights an
amount in cash equal to their accrued and unpaid distribution equivalents as
of the Effective Time (such payment to be net of applicable withholding
taxes). The Company represents and warrants that the total amount of shares of
Company Common Stock specified in the Distribution Equivalent Rights is
74,000 and, as of November 30, 2003, the total unpaid and unreinvested
distribution equivalents credited to the holders of Distribution Equivalent
Rights shall be $22,147.



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any restrictions
imposed pursuant to any stock plan on any outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (such shares, " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") to lapse and each Company
Restricted Share shall be subject to the same terms and conditions of this
Agreement as other shares of Company Common Stock, including, but not limited
to, _Section 2.1(c)_ herein.



(d) Except as otherwise agreed to by the parties, (i) the Company shall cause
the Stock Plans to terminate as of the Effective Time and the provisions in
any other plan, program or arrangement, providing for the issuance or grant by
the Company of any interest in respect of the shares of beneficial interest of
the Company shall be terminated and have no further force or effect as of the
Effective Time and (ii) the Company shall ensure that following the Effective
Time no holder of Company Options or any  



 

\- 7 -  participant in the Stock Plans or anyone otherwise shall have any right to
acquire any equity securities or other interest in respect of the capital
stock of the Company, the Surviving Entity or any Company Subsidiary (as
defined herein).



ARTICLE III.

(a) The Company is a real estate investment trust duly organized, validly

the requisite power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted or currently proposed to be conducted.



(b) _Section 3.1(b)_ of the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure
Letter_ ") lists the jurisdictions in which the Company is qualified to do
business as a foreign trust, which constitute all of the jurisdictions where
the character of the properties owned or held under lease or the nature of
its activities make such qualification necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect (as defined below).



As used in this Agreement, a " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " shall mean
any event, circumstance or development (i) that has or is reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets, condition

adverse effect on the ability of Genesis Healthcare Ventures, Inc. ("
_Genesis_ "; which term for purposes of this definition shall mean Genesis
Healthcare Corporation (" _GHC_ " _)_ after such time as the Genesis Spin-off
(as defined herein) is consummated) or its Subsidiaries to perform their
respective obligations under the Space Leases (as defined herein) to which
they are a party or the guarantees thereof, provided, however, that the
Genesis Spin-off, in and of itself, shall not be deemed to have such effect,

Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), or (ii) that materially adversely affects the
ability of the Company or Parent, as the case may be, to perform its
obligations hereunder or consummate the Merger; excluding, however, in the
case of clause (i), any adverse effect arising from conditions in the United
States economy or capital or financial markets generally or the effects of
the public announcement of the pendency of the transactions contemplated
hereby.



 

\- 8 - (c) The Company has delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of its
Articles of Amendment and Restatement of Declaration of Trust including all
amendments and supplements thereto (collectively, the " _Declaration_ ") and
its Amended and Restated Bylaws as in effect as of the date of this Agreement
(together with the Declaration, the " _Company Organizational Documents_ ").



Section 3.2. The Company Subsidiaries.



(a) _Section 3.2 of the Company Disclosure Letter_ sets forth (i) each
Subsidiary of the Company (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ "), (ii) the legal

Company Material Adverse Effect. True and correct copies of the Articles of
Incorporation, By-Laws, partnership agreements, joint venture and operating

meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not
waived. None of the Group Members or any ERISA Affiliate has any outstanding
liability under Section 4062 of ERISA to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (" _PBGC_ ") or to a trustee appointed under Section 4042 of
ERISA, and no events have occurred and no circumstances exist that would be
expected to result in any such Liability to any Group Member or ERISA
Affiliate. There has been no "reportable event" within the meaning of Section
4043 of ERISA with respect to any Title IV Plan that would require the giving
of notice to the PBGC or any other event requiring disclosure under Section
4041(c)(3)(C) or 4063(a) of ERISA. None of the Group Members or any ERISA
Affiliate has engaged in any transaction described in Section 4069 of ERISA
that would be expected to result in Liability to any Group Member with
respect to any Title IV Plan. All premiums due the PBGC with respect to any
Title IV Plan have been paid when due.



(f) With respect to each Pension Plan maintained or sponsored by any
Controlled Group Member, such plans provide the plan sponsor the authority to
amend or terminate the plan at any time, subject to applicable requirements of
ERISA and the Code.



(g) Except as disclosed on _Section 3.14(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter_
, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement
or arrangement that could reasonably be expected to result, separately or in
the aggregate, in the actual or deemed payment (including any payment made
pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ herein) by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of any "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code or that would be nondeductible under Section 162(m)
of the Code.



Section 3.15. Employee Matters.



(a) _Section 3.15(a)_ _of the Company Disclosure Letter_ lists the employee
handbooks of the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries currently in
effect. A copy of each such employee handbook has previously been delivered to
Parent. Such handbooks fairly and accurately summarize all material employee
policies, vacation policies and payroll practices of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries. Neither  



 

\- 24 -  the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to, or bound by,
any collective bargaining agreement, contract or other agreement or
understanding with a labor union or other labor organization, nor has the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries agreed that any unit of their
employees is appropriate for collective bargaining. No union or other labor
organization has been certified as bargaining representative for any of the
Companys or the Company Subsidiaries employees. To the Knowledge of the
Company there are no organizational efforts with respect to the formation of a
collective bargaining unit presently being made or threatened involving
employees of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries.



(b) Set forth on _Section 3.15(b)_ _of the Company Disclosure Letter_ is a
true and complete list of all cash and non-cash payments, rights to property
or other contract rights which will become payable, accelerated or vested to
or in each employee, officer or trustee (or person occupying a similar
position in any other entity) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a
result of the Merger (other than the Merger Consideration payable to such
persons solely as a result of such persons ownership of Company Common Stock
or payments made to such persons pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
solely as a result of such persons ownership of Company Options or
Distribution Equivalent Rights). Except as described on _Section 3.15(b) of
the Company Disclosure Letter_ , there is no employment or severance contract,
or other agreement requiring payments, cancellation of indebtedness or other
obligation to be made on a change of control or otherwise as a result of the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either
alone or upon the occurrence of subsequent events, with respect to any
employee, officer or trustee (or person occupying a similar position in any
other entity) of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.



 

Section 3.16. Taxes.



(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has filed all Tax returns
and reports required to be filed by it (after giving effect to any filing
extension properly granted by a Governmental Agency having authority to do so)
and has paid (or the Company has paid on its behalf) all Taxes required to be
paid by it except (i) as set forth on _Section 3.16 of the Company Disclosure
Letter_ , or (ii) as regards Taxes that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which the Company or the applicable the
Company Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves. Such Tax
returns and reports are true, correct and complete. The Company Audited
Financials reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable or accrued by the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions
thereof through the Financial Statement Date. Since the Financial Statement
Date, the Company has incurred no liability for Taxes under Sections 857(b),
860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including, without limitation, any tax arising
from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code, and
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any liability for
Taxes other than in the Ordinary Course of Business. The Company has
established in its books and records reserves or accrued liabilities
or expenses that are adequate for payment of all Taxes for which the Company
or any Company Subsidiary is liable but are not yet due and payable. No event
has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, which presents a
material risk that any material Tax  



 

\- 25 -  described in the preceding sentence will be imposed upon the Company. No
deficiency for any Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed pursuant to
a "30-day letter" or notice of deficiency sent by the IRS or any state, local
or foreign taxing authority, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened.
No waiver of the time to assess any such Taxes has been executed by the
Company or any the Company Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
no requests for such waivers are pending.



(b) All Taxes which the Company or Company Subsidiaries are required by Law to
withhold or collect, including Taxes required to have been withheld in
connection with amounts paid or owing to an employee, independent contractor,
creditor, stockholder or other third party and sales, gross receipts and use
taxes, have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have
been paid over to the proper Governmental Agency or are held in separate bank
accounts for such purpose. There are no encumbrances for Taxes upon the assets
of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries except for statutory encumbrances
for Taxes not yet due. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Taxes_ " shall mean
any federal, state, local, foreign or other tax, assessment, levy, lien or
charge, including, without limitation, any income, gross receipts, excise,
employment, sales, use, transfer, license, payroll, franchise, severance,
stamp, withholding, Social Security, unemployment, real property, personal
property, property gains, registration, capital stock, value added, single
business, occupation, workers compensation, alternative or add-on minimum,
estimated, or other tax, including, without limitation any interest, penalties
or additions thereto and water or sewer charges or rents.



(c) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any liability for the
Taxes of any Person other than the Company or Company Subsidiaries and the
Company and Company Subsidiaries do not have any Liability for the Taxes of
any Person other than the Company or Company Subsidiaries either (i) under
Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state,
local or foreign Legal Requirements) or (ii) to the Knowledge of the Company
as a transferee or successor.



(d) None of the Company or any Company Subsidiary has any Liability for the
Taxes of any Person other than the Company or Company Subsidiaries and the
Company and Company Subsidiaries do not have any Liability for the Taxes of
any Person other than the Company or Company Subsidiaries under any tax
sharing or tax indemnity agreements.



(e) The Company and each Company Subsidiary that is a U.S. corporation has
disclosed to the IRS all positions taken on their federal income Tax returns
which could give rise to a substantial understatement of Tax under Section
6662 of the Code.



(f) The Company (i) has since its tax year ended December 31, 1998 qualified
as a real estate investment trust (a " _REIT_ ") within the meaning of
Section 856 of the Code, (ii) has operated since the Financial Statement Date
in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year ending on the
earlier of December 31, 2003, or the Closing Date and, if later, for the
taxable year of the Company ending on the Closing Date, and (iii) has not
taken or omitted to take any action which would reasonably be expected to (A)
result in any rents or other amounts paid by tenants of the Properties to be
excluded  



 

\- 26 -  from the definition of "rents from real property" or (B) result in a
challenge to its status as a REIT and, to the Companys Knowledge, no such
challenge is pending or threatened. Each Company Subsidiary which is a
partnership, joint venture, limited liability company or other entity other
than a corporation (i) has been since its formation and continues to be
treated for federal income tax purposes as a partnership or as an entity that
is disregarded for federal income tax purposes and not as a corporation or an
association taxable as a corporation and (ii) has not since the later of its
formation or the acquisition by the Company of a direct or indirect interest
therein, owned any assets (including, without limitation, securities) that
would cause the Company to violate Section 856(c)(4) of the Code. Each Company
Subsidiary which is a corporation or treated as an association taxable as a
corporation and any Person in which the Company owns 10% or more, by vote or
by value, of such Persons securities, is and has been since its formation or
acquisition by the Company a qualified REIT subsidiary under Section 856(i)
of the Code, or is and has been a "taxable REIT subsidiary" under Section
856(l) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds any
asset the disposition of which would be subject to rules similar to Section
1374 of the Code as a result of Treas. Reg. § 1.337(d)-5, Treas. Reg. §
1.337(d)-6 or Treas. Reg. § 1.337(d)-7.



(g) To the Companys Knowledge, as of the date hereof, the Company is a
"domestically-controlled" REIT within the meaning of Section 897(h) of the
Code.



(h) Except as set forth on _Section 3.16_ _of the Company Disclosure Letter_
(such request set forth on _Section 3.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter_
being referred to in this Agreement as the " _Genesis Ruling Request_ "),
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has pending any request for a
tax ruling with a taxing authority. The Company has delivered to Parent true
and correct copies of the Genesis Ruling Request, together with all related
correspondence and supplemental submissions related thereto. To the Knowledge
of the Company, except as has been delivered or made available to Parent, (i)
neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any correspondence
or other communication from, or sent any correspondence or other
communication to, the IRS relating to tax credits for MHFA Properties; and
(ii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is aware or in possession
of any correspondence or other communications between the IRS and any other
party relating to any Company Property relating to tax credits for MHFA
Properties.

operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries in substantially the manner
currently conducted and (ii) have been maintained in accordance with the

the certificate of occupancy for each Company Property, that is necessary or
appropriate for the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as

the Company, threatened, to revoke or limit any Company Permit. Except as set
forth on _Section 3.18(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter_ :



(i) the Company is, and at all times since the Financial Statement Date has
been, in compliance in all material respects with all of the terms and
requirements of each Company Permit; and

(including, without limitation, partnership interests and units), or (C)
sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge, transfer or other disposition ("

\- 46 -  more than 20% of the consolidated assets of the Company (any such proposal
or offer being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), or
engage in any discussions or negotiations with or provide any confidential or
non-public information or data to, or afford access to properties, books or
records to, any Person relating to, or that may reasonably be expected to
lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any letter of intent,
agreement in principle or agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
propose publicly to agree to do any of the foregoing, or otherwise facilitate
any effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition Proposal
(including, without limitation, by amending or granting any waiver under, the
Rights Agreement);



(ii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary shall permit any of their
respective Representatives to engage in any of the activities described in
_Section 6.6(a)(i)_ ;



(iii) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing
(including, without limitation, any Acquisition Proposal) and shall take
commercially reasonable actions to inform each Company Representative, of the
obligations undertaken in this _Section 6.6_ and to cause each such Company
Representative to comply with such obligations; and



(iv) the Company shall (A) notify Parent promptly (but in any event within 48
hours after receipt thereof), orally and in writing, if the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative receives (1) an Acquisition
Proposal or any material amendment or change in any previously received
Acquisition Proposal, (2) any request for confidential or nonpublic
information or data relating to, or for access to the properties, books or
records of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary by any Person that has
made, or to such partys knowledge may be considering making, an Acquisition
Proposal, or (3) any oral or written expression that any such activities,
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with the
Company, and, as applicable, include in such notice the identity of the
Person making such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request, the material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request and, if in writing,
shall promptly deliver to Parent copies of any proposals, indications of
interest, indication or request along with all other related documentation and
correspondence; and (B) keep Parent informed of the status and material terms
of (including all material changes to the status or material terms of) any
such Acquisition Proposal, indication or request.



(b) Notwithstanding _Section 6.6(a)_ , the Board shall not be prohibited from
furnishing information to or entering into discussions or negotiations with,
any Person that makes a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal to the Board
after the date hereof which was not invited, solicited or encouraged, directly
or indirectly, by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company
Representative on or after the date hereof if, and only to the extent that,
(i) the Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with  



 

\- 47 -  its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its duties to the Companys shareholders under Maryland law,
(ii) the Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Acquisition Proposal (as defined herein), (iii) the Company complies
with all of its obligations under this Agreement, (iv) prior to furnishing
such information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, the Company provides written notice to Parent to the effect that it
is furnishing information to, or entering into discussions with such Person
and (v) the Company enters into a confidentiality agreement with such Person
the material terms of which are (without regard to the terms of
such Acquisition Proposal) in all material respects no less favorable to the
Company, and no less restrictive to the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.



(c) If the Board or any committee thereof intends: (i) to approve or
recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Superior Acquisition
Proposal, or (ii) to cause the Company to enter into any agreement with
respect to any Superior Acquisition Proposal (other than any confidentiality
agreement as contemplated by _Section 6.6(b)_ ) (a " _Competing Agreement_
"), then at least three (3) Business Days prior to taking such action: (A) the
Company shall provide Parent with written notice advising Parent that the
Board has received a Superior Acquisition Proposal that it intends to accept,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Acquisition
Proposal and identifying the Person or Persons making such Superior
Acquisition Proposal, and (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its
financial and legal advisors to, negotiate in good faith with Parent to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would cause
such Superior Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Acquisition Proposal (the " _Adjusted Terms_ "). If following the completion
of such three (3) Business Day period the Company and Parent have been unable
to agree upon Adjusted Terms that cause such Superior Acquisition Proposal to
no longer constitute a Superior Acquisition Proposal (taking into account all
financial and strategic considerations and other relevant factors, including
relevant legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of such proposals, and
the conditions, prospects and time required for completion of such proposal),
then the Board or any committee thereof may: (i) approve, advise or recommend,
or propose to approve, advise or recommend, such Superior Acquisition
Proposal; (ii) make an Adverse Recommendation or (iii) cause the Company to
enter into a Competing Agreement with respect to such Superior Acquisition
Proposal.



(d) For all purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Acquisition Proposal_ "
means a bona fide written proposal made by a third party to acquire, directly
or indirectly, the Company and/or the Company Subsidiaries pursuant to a
tender or exchange offer, merger, share exchange, consolidation or sale of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or otherwise (i) on terms which the Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys financial advisors of nationally
recognized reputation, would be more favorable to the holders of the Company
Common Stock than those provided for in the Merger, (ii) for which financing,
to the extent required, in the reasonable judgment of the Board is capable of
 



 

\- 48 -  being obtained and (iii) which the Board determines in good faith is
reasonably capable of being consummated.



(e) Any "stop, look and listen" disclosure that the Board may be compelled to
make with respect to the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal in order to comply
with its duties imposed by Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 of the Exchange Act shall not
constitute a violation of this _Section 6.6_.

 



(f) Nothing in this _Section 6.6_ shall (i) permit the Company to terminate
this Agreement (except as expressly provided in _Article IX_ ) or (ii) except
as expressly provided herein, affect any other obligations of the Company
under this Agreement.



Section 6.7. Taxes.



(a) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer or stamp Taxes, any transfer, recording,
registration and other fees and any similar Taxes that become payable in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
with any related interest, penalties or additions to tax, " _Transfer and
Gains Taxes_ "). From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay or cause
to be paid, without deduction or withholding from any consideration or amounts
payable to shareholders of the Company, all Transfer and Gains Taxes.



(b) The Company will consult with and provide Parent the opportunity to
review and comment upon all returns, reports, questionnaires, applications or
other documents to be filed after the date hereof by the Company with respect
to Taxes including, without limitation, the Companys federal, state
and local income and franchise Tax returns and reports for its taxable years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, and shall not file any such returns, reports
or other documents without the prior review and comment of Parent, which shall
not be unreasonably delayed.



(c) The Company will cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to consult with
and provide Parent the opportunity to review and comment upon all returns,
reports, questionnaires, applications or other documents to be filed after the
date hereof by each respective subsidiary of the Company with respect to
Taxes including, without limitation, each of the Company Subsidiaries
federal, state and local income and franchise Tax returns and reports for its
taxable years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, and the Company shall not
cause any of its subsidiaries to file any such returns, reports or other
documents without the prior review and comment of Parent, which shall not be
unreasonably delayed.



(d) The Company will afford Parent and its representatives the opportunity to
participate in (i) any discussions with the IRS regarding the Genesis Ruling
Request and (ii) conferences with the Companys advisors in respect of the
Genesis Ruling Request, including the opportunity to review and comment upon
any proposed submissions in advance.



 

\- 49 - (e) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
$5.0 million that is the subject of the Genesis Ruling Request is received at
the earliest practicable date, which efforts may include those set forth on
_Section 6.7(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter_.



Section 6.8. Coordination of Dividends. From and after the date hereof, the
Company shall not declare, pay or make any dividend or distribution to its
shareholders without the prior written consent of Parent; provided, however,
that the written consent of Parent shall not be required for the authorization
and payment of (i) dividends and distributions required for the Company to
maintain its status as a REIT under the Code (each, a " _REIT Dividend_ ") and
(ii) a quarterly distribution with respect to the Company Common Stock for
the Companys fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2003 of up to $.18 per share
of Company Common Stock. In the event that a distribution with respect to the
Company Common Stock permitted by this _Section 6.8_ has (x) a record date
prior to the Effective Time and (y) has not been paid as of the Effective
Time, the holders of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to receive such
distribution from the Company at the time such shares are exchanged pursuant
to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 6.8_ to the
contrary, Parent may, prior to the Effective Time, (a) request in writing that
the Companys Board authorize the declaration and payment (with the payment to
be made immediately prior to the Effective Time) of such dividends as may be
necessary to distribute the additional real estate investment trust taxable
income (as defined in Section 857(b)(2) of the Code) that Parent estimates
would result from an election under Section 338 of the Code (a " _338
Dividend_ "); and (b) request in writing that the Companys Board authorize
the declaration and payment at the time specified in the request of such REIT
Dividends as may be necessary to ensure the Companys continued qualification
as a REIT under the Code; provided as to clauses (a) and (b) that Parent
provides such written notice sufficiently in advance of the Effective Time so
as to allow for the setting of any record date and notices required by
the New York Stock Exchange, the Companys Declaration or Maryland law. Upon
receipt of such request, the Companys Board shall authorize the requested 338
Dividend (which 338 Dividend may be conditional on the Closing) or REIT
Dividend, as the case may be, subject to requirements of law and rules of the
New York Stock Exchange and compliance with the Companys Declaration,
including any liquidity requirements that may be applicable as a condition
precedent to declaration of a dividend. Any request by Parent under clause
(b) shall be accompanied by an opinion of a tax advisor of recognized national
standing (which may be Ernst and Young LLP or Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP)
which concludes that there is a significant risk that failure to make such
distribution would result in failure of the Company to qualify as a REIT under
the Code.



Section 6.9. New York Stock Exchange Listing. During the period from the date
hereof and continuing until the Effective Time: (i) the Company shall take
all such action that is required for the Company Common Stock to remain listed
on the New York Stock Exchange in accordance with Section 3-202(c)(1)(ii) of
the Maryland General Corporation Law, and (ii) Parent shall take all
such action that is required for its shares of common stock, par value $.25
per share, to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange in accordance with
Section 3-202(c)(1)(ii) of the Maryland General Corporation Law.



Section 6.10. Amendment of Company Disclosure Letter. The Company shall be
entitled to supplement any information disclosed in the Company Disclosure
Letter to  



 

\- 50 -  disclose actions taken, or agreements entered into, by the Company or its
Subsidiaries after the date of this Agreement, which are permitted to be taken
or entered into pursuant to _Section 5.1_ hereof and which, if existing at
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such Company Disclosure Letter. Except for the Sections of the
Company Disclosure Letter expressly referring to a specific date certain, for
all purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation for purposes of
determining whether the conditions set forth in Section 7 (excluding Section
7.2(c)) have been fulfilled, the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to
be the Company Disclosure Letter as amended or supplemented pursuant hereto to
reflect such supplemented information.



Section 6.11. Parent Indenture. The Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to effect any
modifications (to become effective as of the Effective Time) to any agreements
or organizational or other documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries
necessary for Parent and its Subsidiaries to comply, in such manner as is
determined by Parent, with the covenants in the outstanding indentures or
credit agreements of Parent and its Subsidiaries in connection with the
implementation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

to which an Indemnified Party may be entitled.



(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then the transferee shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 8.2_ , which obligations are expressly intended to be
for the irrevocable benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified
Party covered hereby.

Section 9.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this

_10.2_ , _10.3_ , _10.4_ , and _10.6_  through _10.12_ , which provisions
shall survive the termination; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
relieve any party from any liability for any breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.



 

\- 57 - Section 9.3. Fees and Expenses.



(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) below, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such expenses (including brokers or finders
fees and the expenses of its representatives).



(b) If any of the conditions set forth in paragraph (c) or (d) below are
satisfied, then the Company shall, subject to and in accordance with such
paragraphs, pay to Parent, by wire transfer of immediate available funds to
an account specified by Parent, the Break-Up Fee (as defined below) or the
Parent Expense Reimbursement (as defined below).



(c) The Company shall pay the Break-Up Fee (or the portion thereof described
below) as follows:



(i) if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to the provisions of
_Section 9.1(e)_ or if the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 9.1(f)_ or if either party terminates this Agreement at
a time when Parent had the right to terminate pursuant to _Section 9.1(e),_
the Company shall pay to Parent the Break-Up Fee, which payment shall be made
concurrent with any such termination by the Company and on the same day as any
such termination by Parent; or



(ii) if an Acquisition Proposal is received or publicly disclosed after the
date hereof, and thereafter Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(c)_ , and within twelve (12) months following such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for, or
consummates, an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal
is the same Acquisition Proposal which had been received or publicly disclosed
at the time of termination of this Agreement), the Company shall, concurrent
with consummating such transaction, pay to Parent the Break-Up Fee; or



(iii) if an Acquisition Proposal is received or publicly disclosed after the
date hereof, and thereafter Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.1(d)_ , and within twelve (12) months following such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement providing for, or
consummates, an Acquisition Proposal (whether or not such Acquisition Proposal
is the same Acquisition Proposal which had been received or
publicly disclosed at the time of termination of this Agreement), the Company
shall, concurrent with consummating such transaction, pay to Parent the Break-
Up Fee.



(d) The Company shall pay the Parent Expense Reimbursement (or the portion
thereof described below) to Parent (provided the Company was not entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(h)_ ) if Parent or the
Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to (i) _Section 9.1(b)_ (but only
on account of an Order resulting  



 

\- 58 -  from a claim by a Person other than a Governmental Agency), (ii) _Section
9.1(c)_ (and no Acquisition Proposal was received or publicly disclosed
after the date hereof and prior to termination), (iii) _Section 9.1(d)_ (and
no Acquisition Proposal was received or publicly disclosed after the date
hereof and prior to termination), unless the sole remaining unsatisfied or
unwaived condition as of such termination date is the failure to obtain any
of the consents and approvals listed on _Section 7.2(d)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter_ , or (iv) _Section 9.1(c)_ or _(d)_ , if an Acquisition
Proposal was received or publicly disclosed after the date hereof, but the
Break-Up Fee is not payable to Parent in accordance with the terms of _Section
9.3(c)(ii)_ or _(iii)_ , as the case may be. In the case of clauses (i), (ii),
and (iii) above, the payment of the Parent Expense Reimbursement (or the
portion thereof described below) shall be made within two Business Days after
termination of this Agreement, and in the case of clause (iv) above, such
payment shall be made within two Business Days after termination of the
Acquisition Proposal.



(e) " _Break-Up Fee_ " shall be an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
$4,250,000 (the " _Maximum Break-Up Fee_ ") and (ii) the sum of (A) the
maximum amount that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet
the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if
the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in Sections
856(c)(2)(A)-(H) and 856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "),
as determined by independent accountants to Parent, and (B) in the event
Parent receives a letter from outside counsel (the " _Break-Up Fee Tax
Opinion_ ") indicating that Parents receipt of the Maximum Break-Up Fee would
either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income
within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (the " _REIT
Requirements_ ") or that the receipt by Parent of the excess of the Maximum
Break-Up Fee over the amount payable in _clause (A)_ following the receipt of
such opinion would not be deemed constructively received prior thereto, the
Maximum Break-Up Fee less the amount payable under _clause (A)_ above. In the
event that Parent is not able to receive the Maximum Break-Up Fee, the
Company shall place the unpaid amount in escrow and shall not release any
portion thereof to Parent unless and until the Company receives, from time to
time, any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from Parents
independent accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid at that
time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to meet the REIT Requirements or
(ii) a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion indicating the maximum amount that can be
paid at that time to as Qualifying Income, as gross income that is excluded
under the REIT Requirements or as amounts not constructively received prior to
such time, in either of which events the Company shall pay to Parent the
lesser of the unpaid Maximum Break-Up Fee or the maximum amount stated in the
letter referred to in (i) above or the opinion referred to in (ii) above.



(f) The " _Parent Expense Reimbursement_ " shall be an amount equal to the
lesser of (i) Parents out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without
limitation, all attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees and
expenses), not to exceed $1,500,000, and (ii) the sum of (A) the maximum
amount that can be paid to Parent without causing it to fail to meet the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the
payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income, as determined
by independent accountants to Parent, and (B) in the event Parent receives a
Break-Up Fee  



 

\- 59 -  Tax Opinion indicating that Parents receipt of the Parent Expense
Reimbursement would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded
from gross income within the meaning of the REIT Requirements or that receipt
by Parent of the excess of the Parent Expense Reimbursement over the amount
payable under _clause (A)_ following the receipt of such opinion would not be
deemed constructively received prior thereto, the Parent Expense
Reimbursement less the amount payable under _clause (A)_ above. In the event
that Parent is not able to receive the full Parent Expense Reimbursement, the
Company shall pay Parent the unpaid amount within two (2) Business Days after
receipt, from time to time, of any one or combination of the following: (i) a
letter from Parents independent accountants indicating the maximum amount
that can be paid at that time to Parent without causing Parent to fail to
meet the REIT Requirements or (ii) a Break-Up Fee Tax Opinion indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid at that time to Parent as Qualifying Income,
as gross income that is excluded under the REIT Requirements or as amounts
not constructively received prior to such time, in either of which events the
Company shall pay to Parent the lesser of the unpaid Parent Expense
Reimbursement or the maximum amount stated in the letter referred to in (i)
above or the opinion referred to in (ii) above.



(g) The payment of the Break-Up Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement shall
be compensation and liquidated damages for the loss suffered by Parent as a
result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and to avoid the
difficulty of determining damages under the circumstances, and does not
constitute a penalty. The Break-Up Fee or the Parent Expense Reimbursement
shall not be deemed to constitute the measure of damages suffered by Parent in
any instance in which the payment of the Break-Up Fee or Parent Expense
Reimbursement is not provided for under the terms of this Agreement. In the
event that Parent is required to commence litigation to seek all or a portion
of the amounts payable under this _Section 9.3_ , and Parent prevails in such
litigation, Parent shall be entitled to receive, in addition to all amounts
that it is otherwise entitled to receive under this _Section 9.3_ , all
expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees) which it has
incurred in enforcing its rights hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence
and excluding damages arising out of any breach by a party of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, neither party shall have any other liability to the other after
the payment thereof.



(h) The Companys obligation to pay any unpaid portion of the Break-Up Fee or
Parent Expense Reimbursement shall terminate three years from the date of this
Agreement, provided the Companys obligation to pay any amounts under this
_Section 9.3_ shall have accrued within the applicable time period set forth
in this _Section 9.3_.
