are the same as the rights, preferences, privileges and voting powers, and
limitations and restrictions thereof, of the Series C Preferred Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time, taken as a whole (the "

Restricted Stock Unit shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration
with respect to each such Company Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with

the Fourth Amendment to the First Southwest Merger, each of the Escrow Shares
shall be converted into the right to receive from Purchaser the Merger
Consideration, and each of the Escrow Options shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as set forth in Section 1.5.

conditions currently applicable to Escrow Shares and Escrow Options with
respect to ownership, payment of dividends, and release from escrow, pursuant

Stock and an amount in cash which together are equal to the aggregate Merger

to (x) each holder of record of Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares which,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.4, and (z) each holder of
Escrow Shares that were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8, along with, in each case, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificate(s)
or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificate(s) (or
affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s))) or Book-Entry Shares to
the Exchange Agent and shall be substantially in such form and have such other
provisions as shall be prescribed by the Exchange Agent Agreement (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in surrendering
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the applicable Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor and any dividends or
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(c).

 

(b) Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry

of Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive promptly after the
Effective Time but in any event within ten (10) business days after such
surrender, the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in respect of the shares of

 



\- 7 -   Company Common Stock represented by its Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Shares.
Until so surrendered, each such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall
represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only the right to
receive, without interest, the applicable Merger Consideration and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with, and any dividends or distributions to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to, this Article II.

(c) No dividends or other distributions with respect to Purchaser Common Stock
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented
thereby, in each case unless and until the surrender of such Certificate or
Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws, following surrender
of any such Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with this Article
II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, without interest,
(i) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to the whole shares of
Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share and
paid prior to such surrender date, and/or (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares with a record date after the Effective Time (but before such surrender

than the person in whose name the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares
so surrendered is registered if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly
representing such Company Common Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment or
issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of
the payment or issuance to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, or establish to the reasonable satisfaction
of Purchaser that the tax has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange
Agent (or, subsequent to the earlier of (x) the one-year anniversary of the
Effective Time and (y) the expiration or termination of the Exchange Agent
Agreement, Purchaser or the Surviving Company) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common
Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company
Common Stock such amounts as the Exchange Agent, Purchaser or the
Surviving Company, as the case may be, is required to deduct and withhold
under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent the amounts are so
withheld by the Exchange Agent, Purchaser or the Surviving Company, as the
case may be, and timely paid over to the appropriate Governmental Entity, such

 



\- 8 -   withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Restricted Stock Units in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by the Exchange Agent or Purchaser, as the case may be.

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other than to
settle transfers of Company Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
representing such shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the applicable Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be
issued or paid in consideration therefor in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Article II.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for exchange, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Purchaser Common Stock shall be payable on or
with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Purchaser. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Purchaser shall pay to each former shareholder of Company who otherwise
would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded
to the nearest cent) determined by multiplying (i) average of the high and low
sales prices of the Purchaser Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange, as
reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Transaction Tape, on the
Closing Date by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder at the Effective Time and
rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Purchaser Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to
receive pursuant to Section 1.4.

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of Company as of the one year anniversary of the Effective Time
will be transferred to Purchaser. In such event, any former shareholders of
Company who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to Purchaser with respect to the Merger Consideration,
any cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and
distributions on the Purchaser Common Stock deliverable in respect of each
share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Purchaser, the Surviving Company, the Exchange Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such

 



\- 9 -   Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Purchaser may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

2.3 _Exchange Procedures and Tax Withholding for Company Stock Awards_. As
soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event
within fifteen (15) business days thereafter subject to Purchasers receipt of
a stock-based award surrender agreement from the holder in the form set forth
on Section 2.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and satisfaction by the
holder of all Tax obligations, Purchaser shall or shall cause the Surviving
Company or the Exchange Agent to deliver to each holder of Company Stock
Options, Company Restricted Shares and Company Restricted Stock Units
(collectively, " _Company Stock Awards_ ") that were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5, 1.6 or 1.7, as
set forth in the books and records of the Company, the applicable Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common
Stock to be issued or paid in consideration therefor, less the aggregate
exercise price, in the case of Company Stock Options, and in each case, less
and subject to the satisfaction of applicable Taxes, each as provided herein;
_provided, however_ , that all Merger Consideration, less the aggregate
exercise price and applicable Taxes, in respect of Company Stock Options that
are Escrow Options, shall be delivered to the agent for the Escrow under the
First Southwest Merger Agreement and not the holder of such Company Stock
Option. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration payable in respect of each
holders Company Stock Awards pursuant to Section 1.5, 1.6 or 1.7 (the "
_Stock Award Cash Amount_ ") shall be reduced by all Taxes required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or
foreign Law in respect of such Company Stock Awards (the " _Stock Award
Withholding Amount_ "). If the Stock Award Withholding Amount for any holder
exceeds the aggregate Stock Award Cash Amount for such holder (such excess,
the " _Stock Award Withholding Shortfall_ "), then, prior to delivery of the
aggregate Per Share Stock Consideration in respect of such Company Stock
Awards, the holder of the Company Stock Awards shall be required to remit in
cash (or make other arrangements that are satisfactory to the Surviving
Company and Purchaser for the satisfaction of) the Stock Award Withholding
Shortfall. The aggregate exercise price for each holders Company Stock
Options shall be deducted (a) first from the Stock Award Cash Amount, to the
extent that the Stock Award Cash Amount exceeds the Stock Award Withholding
Amount, and (b) then from the aggregate Per Share Stock Consideration, with
the value of such Per Share Stock Consideration based on the average of the
high and low sales prices of the Purchaser Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Transaction Tape, on the Closing Date.

Plan or the imposition of any lien on the assets of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under ERISA or the Code. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any applicable

control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer
Plan_ "); (ii) none of Company or its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective

arrangements providing for post-retirement welfare benefits.

(i) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have been asserted or
instituted, or to the Knowledge of Company, no set of circumstances exists
which may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Employee
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the

material liability of Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the U.S.
Department of the Treasury (the " _Treasury Department_ "), the U.S.
Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Employee Benefit Plan or any
participant in an Employee Benefit Plan. Neither Company nor any of its

deferred compensation in the gross income of any individual or entity, and
subject to an additional tax, as a result of the operation of Section 409A of
the Code and no arrangement exists with respect to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan that would result in income inclusion under Section 409A(b)
of the Code.

 



\- 23 -  (k) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or together with any

otherwise) becoming due under any Employee Benefit Plan, whether or not such
payment is contingent, (ii) increase any payments or benefits otherwise

determined without regard to Section 280G(b)(4) of the Code. No Employee
Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section

(e) Neither Purchaser Insurance Company nor any of their affiliates have
engaged in, or colluded with or assisted any other persons with, the paying of
contingent commissions to steer business to them or colluded with brokers or

Companies have not received notice

 



\- 55 -   of any such claim or assessment, and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, there
is no basis for the assertion of any such claim or assessment against the
Purchaser Insurance Companies by any state insurance guaranty association,

with notice or lapse of time or both) will result in a default under, or cause
the permanent impairment of, any of the Investment Assets. All of the
Investment Assets comply with, and the acquisition thereof complied with, any
and all investment restrictions under applicable Law in all material respects.

(h) (i) Purchaser has provided Company a complete and correct list of all
reinsurance, coinsurance or retrocession treaties, agreements, slips, binders,
cover notes or other arrangements of any kind (each, a " _Reinsurance

Purchaser Insurance Company is a party as a cedent and any terminated or
expired treaty or agreement under which there remains any outstanding
liability.

 

(ii) Each Reinsurance Agreement is a valid and legally binding agreement of
the applicable Purchaser Insurance Company, and, to the Knowledge of
Purchaser, the counterparty or counterparties thereto, is enforceable in
accordance with its terms (subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception) and
is in full force and effect. The applicable Purchaser Insurance Company has

to the date hereof under each such Reinsurance Agreement. Neither Purchaser
Insurance Company nor, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any counterparty or
counterparties, is in breach of any provision of any such Reinsurance
Agreement. No event or condition exists that constitutes, after notice or

its Statutory Statements. No such Reinsurance Agreement contains any
provision providing that any such party thereto (other than a Purchaser
Insurance Company) may terminate, cancel, or commute the same by reason of the
consummation of the Merger. 

(iii) With respect to any such Reinsurance Agreement for which a Purchaser
Insurance Company is taking credit on its most recent statutory financial
statements or has taken credit on any Statutory Statements from and after

or any material portion of the assets, business, deposits or properties of any
other entity except in the ordinary course of business and in a transaction
that, together with other such transactions, is not material to it and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and would not reasonably be expected to
present a material risk that the Closing Date will be materially delayed or
that the Requisite Regulatory Approvals will be more difficult to obtain.

(h) Amend the material terms of, waive any material rights under, terminate,

Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus.
Each of Purchaser and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have
the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
practicable after such filing, and each of Company and Purchaser shall
thereafter mail or deliver the Joint Proxy Statement to its
shareholders. Purchaser shall also use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
all necessary state securities law or "blue sky" permits and approvals

documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, to
obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities that are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Merger and, if requested by Purchaser, a
distribution of the shares of First Southwest Holdings, LLC and its
subsidiaries to Purchaser or similar regulatory restructuring to be effected
following the closing of the Merger, to the extent such distribution or
similar restructuring would not reasonably be expected to present a material
risk that the Closing Date will be materially delayed or that the Requisite
Regulatory Approvals will be more difficult to obtain) as soon as possible,
and in any event no later than December 31, 2012, to the extent reasonably
practicable, and to comply with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all such third parties or
Governmental Entities; _provided, however_ , that Purchaser shall file an
application under Section 3 of the BHC Act with the Federal Reserve no later
than twenty (20) business days following the date of this Agreement. Company
and Purchaser shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent
practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to
applicable laws, all the non-confidential information relating to Company or
Purchaser (excluding any confidential financial information relating to

 



\- 65 -   individuals), as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries,
that appear in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any
third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the
parties shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties shall
consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits,
consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental
Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party shall consult with the other in advance of any meeting
or conference with any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, give the other party and/or its counsel the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

 

(c) Each of Purchaser and Company shall, upon request, furnish to the other
all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or any
other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Purchaser, Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental
Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of Purchaser and Company agrees, as to itself and
its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by
it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at
the time the Form S-4 and each amendment or supplement thereto, if any,
becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading and (ii) the Joint
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to shareholders and at the time of Companys meeting of its
shareholders to consider and vote upon approval of this Agreement, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which such statement was made, not
misleading. Each of Purchaser and Company further agrees that if it becomes
aware that any information furnished by it would cause any of the statements
in the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform
the other party thereof and to take appropriate steps to correct the Form S-4
or the Joint Proxy Statement.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each of Purchaser
and Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) avoid the entry of,
or to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
would restrain, prevent or delay the Closing, and (ii) avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any applicable law so as to enable the Closing to
occur as soon as possible, and in any event no later than December 31, 2012 to
the extent reasonably practicable, including

 



\- 66 -   proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of
businesses or assets of Purchaser, Company and their respective Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
require Purchaser to take any actions specified in this Section 6.1(d) that
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (measured on a
scale relative to Company) on Purchaser or Company.

(e) Purchaser agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Company, at or prior to the
Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other
instruments required for the due assumption of Companys outstanding debt,
guarantees, securities, and other agreements to the extent required by the
terms of such debt, guarantees, securities, and other agreements.

(f) Each of Purchaser and Company shall promptly advise the other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity the consent or
approval of which is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is
a reasonable likelihood that any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be
obtained or that the receipt of any such approval may be materially delayed. 

6.2 _Access to Information_.

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws, Company shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, advisors, agents and other representatives of
Purchaser, reasonable access, during normal business hours during the period
prior to the Effective Time, to all its properties, books, contracts,
commitments, personnel and records, and, during such period, Company shall,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to Purchaser (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities laws or federal or state banking or insurance laws (other than
reports or documents that Company is not permitted to disclose under
applicable law) and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Purchaser may reasonably request. Upon the
reasonable request of Company, Purchaser shall furnish such reasonable
information about it and its business as is relevant to Company and its
shareholders in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Neither Company nor Purchaser, nor any of their Subsidiaries
shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information to the
extent such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of such party or its Subsidiaries (after giving due consideration
to the existence of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement
between the parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment,
decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of
this Agreement. The parties shall make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

 



\- 67 -  (b) All nonpublic information and materials provided pursuant to
this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement entered into between the parties dated June 10, 2011 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 

(c) No investigation by a party hereto or its representatives shall affect or
be deemed to modify or waive any representations, warranties or covenants of
the other party set forth in this Agreement.

6.3 _Shareholder Approval_. 

(a) The Board of Directors of Company has resolved to recommend to Companys
shareholders that they approve this Agreement and will submit to its
shareholders this Agreement and any other matters required to be approved by
its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement.
Company shall duly take, in accordance with applicable law and the Company
Certificate and Company Bylaws, all action necessary to call, give notice of,
convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act
by the SEC, for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval (the
" _Company Shareholder Meeting_ "). The Board of Directors of Company will use
all reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the Company
Shareholder Approval. However, if the Board of Directors of Company, after
consultation with (and taking account of the advice of) counsel, determines in
good faith that, because of the receipt by Company of a Company Acquisition
Proposal that the Board of Directors of Company concludes in good faith
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, it would be more likely than not to
result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law to continue
to recommend this Agreement, then in submitting this Agreement to Companys
shareholders, the Board of Directors of Company may submit this Agreement to
its shareholders without recommendation (although the resolutions approving
this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in
which event the Board of Directors of Company may communicate the basis for
its lack of a recommendation to its shareholders in the Company Proxy
Statement or an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the
extent required by law; _provided_ that Company may not take any actions
under this sentence until after giving Purchaser at least three business days
notice. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Company
of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its shareholders for a vote.
Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Company
Acquisition Proposal other than the Merger.

 

(b) The Board of Directors of Purchaser has resolved (i) to recommend to
Purchasers shareholders that they approve the issuance of Purchaser Common
Stock in connection with the Merger and (ii) that as of the Effective Time,
the restrictions in Article VII of the charter of Purchaser will no longer be
in the best interests of Purchaser and its shareholders, and that such
restrictions shall cease to be effective as of the Effective Time, and will
submit to its shareholders the proposed issuance of Purchaser Common Stock and
any other matters required to be approved 

 



\- 68 -   by its shareholders in order to carry out the intentions of this Agreement.
Purchaser shall duly take, in accordance with applicable law and the governing
organization documents of Purchaser, all action necessary to call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders, as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act by the SEC, for the purpose of obtaining the
Purchaser Shareholder Approval (the " _Purchaser Shareholder Meeting_ "). The
Board of Directors of Purchaser will use all reasonable best efforts to obtain
from its shareholders the Purchaser Shareholder Approval. However, if the
Board of Directors of Purchaser, after consultation with (and taking account
of the advice of) counsel, determines in good faith that it would be more
likely than not to result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under
applicable law to continue to recommend the issuance proposal, then in
submitting the issuance proposal to Purchasers shareholders, the Board of
Directors of Purchaser may submit this Agreement to its shareholders without
recommendation (although the resolutions approving this Agreement as of the
date hereof may not be rescinded or amended), in which event the Board of
Directors of Purchaser may communicate the basis for its lack of a
recommendation to its shareholders in the Purchaser Proxy Statement or
an appropriate amendment or supplement thereto to the extent required by law;
_provided_ that Purchaser may not take any actions under this sentence until
after giving Company at least three business days notice. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve Purchaser of its obligation to
submit this Agreement to its shareholders to a vote.

(c) Company and Purchaser shall cooperate to schedule and convene the Company
Shareholder Meeting and the Purchaser Shareholder Meeting on the same date.

 

(d) If on the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting, Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common
Stock to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval, Company shall adjourn the
Company Shareholder Meeting until such date as shall be mutually agreed upon
by Company and Purchaser, which date shall not be less than 5 days nor more
than 10 days after the date of adjournment, and subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall continue to use all reasonable best
efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the solicitation of
proxies from shareholders relating to the Company Shareholder Approval.
Company shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholder
Meeting one time pursuant to this Section 6.3(d).

 

(e) If on the date of the Purchaser Shareholder Meeting, Purchaser has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock to obtain the Purchaser Shareholder Approval, Purchaser shall
adjourn the Purchaser Shareholder Meeting until such date as shall be mutually
agreed upon by Company and Purchaser, which date shall not be less than 5
days nor more than 10 days after the date of adjournment, and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue to use all reasonable
best efforts, together with its proxy solicitor, to assist in the solicitation
of proxies from shareholders relating to the Purchaser Shareholder Approval.
Purchaser shall only be required to adjourn or postpone the Purchaser
Shareholder Meeting one time pursuant to this Section 6.3(e).

 



\- 69 -  6.4 _NYSE Listing_. Purchaser shall cause the shares of Purchaser Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger to have been authorized for listing on the NYSE,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

6.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31,
2013, Purchaser shall maintain or cause to be maintained employee benefit
plans for the benefit of employees (as a group) who are actively employed by
Company and its Subsidiaries on and after the Closing Date (the " _Continuing
Employees_ ") that provide employee benefits, in the aggregate, which are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those generally applicable to
employees of Company and/or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date (other than the value of the benefits provided under the ESOP
prior to the Closing Date which shall not be considered in determining whether
benefits are substantially comparable in the aggregate during the period
noted above); _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained
herein shall preclude Purchaser or the Surviving Company from implementing a
single benefit plan for any type of benefit for the Continuing Employees. For
purposes of Sections 6.5(a), (b) and (d), references to Subsidiaries shall
include only those Subsidiaries of Company that are majority owned by Company,
whether by vote or value.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Continuing Employees shall be given
credit under the employee benefit plans in which they become eligible to
participate following the Effective Time for all service with Company or its
Subsidiaries (to the extent Company recognized such service for a similar
purpose under the applicable Employee Benefit Plan) for the purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual; _provided_ that service credit shall
not be recognized (i) (A) for purposes of benefit accruals or levels of credit
under any retirement plan, (B) for any purpose under post-retirement welfare
plans or (C) for purposes of any Purchaser employee benefit plan under which
similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for prior service or any frozen or grandfathered plan of Purchaser or
its Subsidiaries or (ii) if such recognition of service would duplicate any
benefits of a Continuing Employee with respect to the same period of service.
Purchaser and Company agree that where applicable with respect to any group
health care plan maintained by Purchaser in which any Continuing Employee is
eligible to participate, for the plan year in which the Effective Time (or
commencement of participation in a plan of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries) occurs, Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
waive any pre-existing condition exclusion and actively-at-work requirements
and similar limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of
insurability, and (ii) provide that any covered expenses incurred on or
before the Effective Time by the Continuing Employees or such employees
covered dependents shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions after
the Effective Time, to the same extent as such expenses were taken into
account under the comparable Employee Benefit Plan, subject to the applicable
information being provided to Purchaser in a form that Purchaser reasonably
determines is administratively feasible to take into

 



\- 70 -   account under its plans. Such expenses shall also count toward any annual or
lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or similar limitations that apply
under the terms of the applicable plan. 

(c) On the date hereof, the PlainsCapital Financial Supplemental Executive
Pension Plan (" _SEPP_ ") was amended in the manner set forth on Section
6.5(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule subject to and contingent upon the
receipt of an acknowledgement from each SEPP participant. Within the thirty
(30) day period prior to the Closing Date, Company shall take all necessary
steps to cause the SEPP to be terminated, contingent upon the occurrence of
the Effective Time, in accordance with Section 1.409A-3(j)(ix)(B) of the
regulations under Section 409A of the Code, and all SEPP participants shall
receive a payment equal to their accrued benefit under the SEPP (taking into
account any additional accrual in respect of 2012 as provided under the SEPP
as amended) in a lump sum within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date.

(d) If requested by Purchaser in writing delivered to Company not less than
ten (10) business days before the Closing Date, Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall, effective no later than immediately prior
to, and contingent upon, the Closing, adopt such resolutions and/or amendments
(and take any other required action) to terminate the ESOP (with
distributions to occur upon receipt of a favorable determination letter from
the IRS in respect of such termination) and to adopt the necessary amendments
to the ESOP, the ESOP trust and the ESOP Loan documents to ensure that (i)
the Merger Consideration received by the ESOP trustee in connection with the
Merger with respect to the unallocated shares of Company Common Stock held in
the ESOP trust shall first be applied by the ESOP trustee to the full
repayment of the ESOP Loan, (ii) Section 12.06 of the ESOP shall require
immediate lump sum distributions of all ESOP account balances upon receipt of
the favorable determination letter described above (except to the extent
immediate lump sum distribution would not be permitted under applicable law)
and the reference to the purchase of deferred annuity contracts shall be
deleted in its entirety, and (iii) to the extent permitted by applicable law,
the value attributable to the unallocated shares of Company Common Stock
currently held in the ESOP trust can be used in the future for the benefit of
those persons who are ESOP participants and beneficiaries as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time. No later than five (5) business days prior to
the Closing Date, Company shall provide Purchaser with (A) certified copies of
the resolutions and/or amendments adopted by the Board of Directors (or the
appropriate committee thereof) of Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
authorizing that the Company ESOP has been terminated, and (B) executed
amendments to the ESOP, the ESOP trust and the ESOP Loan, as applicable, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser to effectuate such
termination and the other amendments set forth above. In the event of such
ESOP termination, the Continuing Employees who were participants in the ESOP
as of immediately prior to distributions of ESOP account balances shall be
permitted to roll any eligible rollover distributions into another cash or
deferred arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k) sponsored by Company
or the Purchaser and in which the Continuing Employees are eligible (the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ "), provided that shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall
only be permitted to be rolled over into the Company 401(k) Plan if such plan
maintains a Purchaser Common Stock fund.

 



\- 71 -  (e) The parties acknowledge and agree that Company shall take all actions set
forth on Section 6.5(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to the
agreements with Company employees set forth on Section 6.5(e) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 

(f) In the event that the Closing Date occurs prior to the payment of the
Continuing Employees annual bonuses in respect of the 2012 year, Purchaser
agrees that the Continuing Employees shall be eligible to be awarded annual
bonuses in respect of the 2012 year, taking into account Companys performance
for the 2012 performance year, the terms of the applicable Employee Benefit
Plans and the Companys bonus allocation practice in the ordinary course of
business.

(g) Without limiting the generality of Section 9.10, the provisions of this
Section 6.5 are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former employee, independent contractor or any other individual
associated therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party
beneficiary of this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement
be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Employee Benefit Plan,
Purchaser Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by Purchaser, Company or any of their respective
affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Employee Benefit
Plan, Purchaser Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit or
employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or
(iii) confer upon any current or former employee, independent contractor or
other service provider any right to employment or continued employment or
continued service with Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries (including,
following the Closing Date, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries), or
constitute or create an employment or other agreement with any employee,
independent contractor or other service provider.

6.6 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Purchaser and the
Surviving Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable law (and shall also advance expenses as incurred to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable law provided the person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification),
each present and former director, officer and employee of Company and its
Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the
" _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to

 



\- 72 -   matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that the
Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party
is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Subject to the following sentence, for a period of six years following the
Effective Time, Purchaser will provide directors and officers liability
insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of Company or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Effective Time) (providing only for the Side A coverage for Indemnified
Parties where the existing policies also include Side B coverage for Company)
with respect to claims against such directors and officers arising from facts
or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), which insurance will contain at least the
same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the Indemnified Party as that coverage currently provided by
Company; _provided_ that in no event shall Purchaser be required to expend, on
an annual basis, an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums paid as
of the date hereof by Company for any such insurance (the " _Premium Cap_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that if any such annual expense at any time would
exceed the Premium Cap, then Purchaser will cause to be maintained policies
of insurance which provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium
equal to the Premium Cap. At the option of Company, prior to the Effective
Time and in lieu of the foregoing, Company may purchase a tail policy for
directors and officers liability insurance on the terms described in the
prior sentence (including subject to the Premium Cap) and fully pay for such

confidential or nonpublic information or data to, or have any discussions
with, any person relating to, any Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_
that, in the event Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ Company
Acquisition Proposal and the Board of Directors of Company concludes in
good faith that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to result in, a Company Superior Proposal, Company may,
and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries representatives
to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic information and participate in
such negotiations or discussions to the extent that the Board of Directors of
Company concludes in good faith (and based on the advice of counsel) that
failure to take such actions would be more likely than not to result in a
violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable law; _provided_ that prior
to providing any nonpublic information permitted to be provided pursuant to
the foregoing proviso or engaging in any negotiations, it shall have entered
into a confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less
favorable to Company than the Confidentiality Agreement and which expressly

Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange

Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither party would enter into
this Agreement. The amounts payable by Company pursuant to Section 8.3(b)
constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty and shall be the sole
monetary remedy of Purchaser in the event of termination of this Agreement
specified in such section. In the event that either party fails to pay when
due any amounts payable under this Section 8.3, then (i) such party shall
reimburse the other party for all costs and expenses (including disbursements
and reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in connection with the collection of
such overdue amount, and (ii) such party shall pay to the other party
interest on such overdue amount (for the period commencing as of the date that
such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date
that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal
to the prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal on the date such
payment was required to be made.

8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties, by action
taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the shareholders of Company;  _provided_ , _however_ , that after
any approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the
shareholders of Company or the shareholders of Purchaser, there may not be,
without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this
Agreement that requires further approval under applicable law. This Agreement
may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each
of the parties.

 



\- 84 -  8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may,
to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

9.4 _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles,
Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or
Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." As used in this Agreement, the phrase " _to
the Knowledge of Company_ " means the actual knowledge of any of Companys
officers listed on Section 9.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the
phrase " _to the Knowledge of Purchaser_ " means the actual knowledge of any
of Purchasers officers listed on Section 9.4 of the Purchaser Disclosure

Agreement and included in any reference to this Agreement. If any term,
provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by a
court or a federal or state regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions and
covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. If
for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines that any provision,
covenant or restriction is invalid, void or unenforceable, it is the express
intention of the parties that such provision, covenant or restriction be
enforced to the maximum extent permitted.

9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts
(including by facsimile or other electronic means), all of which shall be
considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the
other party, it being understood that each party need not sign the same
counterpart.

 



\- 86 -  9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents and the
instruments referred to in this Agreement), together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, other than the
Confidentiality Agreement.

9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to
contracts made and performed entirely within such state, without giving effect
to its principles of conflicts of laws. The parties hereto agree that any
suit, action or proceeding brought by either party to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any
federal or state court located in the State of Texas. Each of the parties
hereto submits to the jurisdiction of any such court in any suit, action or
proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and hereby irrevocably waives the benefit of jurisdiction
derived from present or future domicile or otherwise in such action or
proceeding. Each party hereto irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court
or that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. 

9.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any
controversy that may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each party hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in
respect of any litigation, directly or indirectly, arising out of, or
relating to, this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative,
agent or attorney of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise,
that such other party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce
the foregoing waiver, (b) each party understands and has considered the
implications of this waiver, (c) each party makes this waiver voluntarily, and
(d) each party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.8.

9.9 _Publicity_. Neither Company nor Purchaser shall, and neither Company nor
Purchaser shall permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect
to, or otherwise make any public statement, or, except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement, any disclosure of nonpublic
information to a third party, concerning, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) of Purchaser, in the case of a proposed announcement,
statement or disclosure by Company, or Company, in the case of a proposed
announcement, statement or disclosure by Purchaser; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that either party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after
prior consultation with the other party to the extent practicable under the
circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement to the extent required by law or by the rules and
regulations of the NYSE.

 



\- 87 -  9.10 _Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any
of the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be
assigned by either of the parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise)
without the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). Any purported assignment in contravention
hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by
each of the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Except for Section 6.6, which is intended to benefit each Indemnified Party
and his or her heirs and representatives, this Agreement (including the
documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement) is not intended
to and does not confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any
rights or remedies under this Agreement.

9.11  _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to seek specific performance of the terms
hereof, this being in addition to any other remedies to which they are
entitled at law or equity.

9.12 _Disclosure Schedule_.

(a) Before entry into this Agreement, Company delivered to Purchaser a
schedule (a " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ ") and Purchaser delivered to
Company a schedule a (" _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ "), each of which sets
forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is necessary or
appropriate either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained
in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more representations or
warranties contained in Article III or Article IV, respectively, or to one or
more covenants contained herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) no such item is required to be
set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence
would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue
or incorrect and (ii) the mere inclusion of an item as an exception to a
representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission that such item
represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Previously Disclosed_ " means
information set forth by Company or Purchaser in the applicable paragraph of
its Company Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, or any other paragraph of its Company Disclosure Schedule or
Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, as applicable (so long as it is reasonably
clear from the context that the disclosure in such other paragraph of its
Company Disclosure Schedule or Purchaser Disclosure Schedule is also
applicable to the section of this Agreement in question).
