   ##### 

  

    

the fair value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the
" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, and the holders thereof shall be entitled to only such
rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or shall effectively waive,
withdraw or lose such holders rights under Section 262 of the DGCL, such
holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have
been converted, at the Effective Time, into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, as set forth in Section 2.1 of this Agreement, without
any interest thereon. 

  

 (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any appraisal demands received by the Company, withdrawals thereof and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL.

 SECTION 2.4 _Surrender of Shares_. (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement with the Companys transfer agent, or such other bank, trust company or other entity qualified to serve as a paying agent as Parent may select that is reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and to receive the Merger Consideration to which the stockholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to this Article II. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent sufficient funds to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.4(b). Such funds may be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Merger Sub or, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation;  _provided_ that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced by such investments will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as Parent directs. 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, as of the Effective Time, of (i) an outstanding certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") or (ii) Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), a form of letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, the surrender of such Shares for payment of the Merger Consideration therefor. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate or of Book-Entry 

   ##### 

  

    

Shares, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents
as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares and such Certificate or book-entry shall
then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable in respect of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than
the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax
either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.4(b), each Certificate and each Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Article II. 

  

 (c) At any time following the date that is twelve months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (d) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares that were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. After the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer shall be canceled and exchanged for the consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth in, this Article II. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any former holder of Shares, Options and Restricted Shares pursuant to this Agreement any amount as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax (as defined below) laws, and any such amount so deducted or withheld shall be treated for all purposes hereunder as having been paid to such holder. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares, Options and Restricted Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (f) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the holders compliance with the replacement requirements established by the Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by the holder of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Article II.

Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and accurate list of the Companys subsidiaries. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing), in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for any such failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. All subsidiaries of the Company are directly or indirectly wholly owned by the Company. " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means any change, effect, event or occurrence that would be materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than any change or effect to the extent resulting from (i) changes in general economic conditions, (ii) changes in laws, rules or regulations (in each case, including changes to tax laws, rules or regulation) or the interpretations thereof affecting the Company, (iii) general changes or developments in the industries in which the Company and its subsidiaries operate; (iv) the announcement of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including any termination of, reduction in or similar negative impact on relationships, contractual or otherwise, with any customers, partners, financing sources or employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to the extent due to the announcement of this Agreement or the identity of the parties to this Agreement, or any actions or omissions required by the express terms of this Agreement, including compliance with the covenants set forth herein or (v) changes in any applicable accounting regulations or principles.

 (c) As of and after the Effective Time, except as provided below, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, give Current Employees credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting and benefit accruals, under any employee compensation and incentive plans, benefit (including vacation) plans, programs, policies and arrangements maintained for the benefit of Current Employees as of and after the Effective Time by Parent, its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation for the Current Employees service with the Company, its subsidiaries

   ##### 

  

    

receipt by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a
request therefor; provided that any person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent required by the DGCL, to
repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not
entitled to indemnification, (y) neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any
proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim
(and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes
an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising
out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents, and (z) the Surviving Corporation shall
in its discretion have the right to direct the defense of any such matter in
all respects, and, to the extent it elects not to direct such defense, shall
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in the defense of any such matter.
Parent agrees to honor and perform under, and to cause the Surviving
Corporation to honor and perform under, all indemnification obligations under
the Company Plans set forth in Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. 

  

 (b) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present directors and officers than are set forth, as of the date hereof, in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals (provided that, subject to Section 6.7(f), nothing herein shall be deemed to limit in any manner the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate thereof to engage in any merger, consolidation, stock sale, stock purchase or similar business combination transaction). 

  

 (c) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, a six-year run-off extension to the Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy, errors and omissions liability policy and employment practices liability policy, each as in effect on the date hereof, with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, effective as of the Effective Time, on the same terms and conditions as the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance, errors and omissions liability insurance and employment practices liability insurance policies. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Party on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 6.7 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

  

 (d) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law, contract or otherwise. 

  

 (e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall 

   ##### 

  

    

not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) distributes, sells, transfers, conveys or
otherwise disposes of all or a majority of its properties and assets to any
person, or distributes, sells, transfers, conveys or otherwise disposes of any
of its assets in a manner that would reasonably be expected to render the
Surviving Corporation unable to satisfy its obligations under this Section
6.7, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may
be, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in Section 6.6 and this
Section 6.7. 

  

 SECTION 6.8 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.8 shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(b) so long as such party has up to then complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section 6.8.

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. 

  

 SECTION 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party hereto may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) subject to the requirements of applicable law, waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.

 SECTION 5. COMMITTEES  The Board of Directors may, by resolution or resolutions passed by a majority of the whole Board of Directors, designate one or more committees, each committee to consist of one or more directors of the Corporation.

 SECTION 8. COMPENSATION  Directors shall not receive any stated salary for their services as directors or as members of committees, but by resolution of the Board of Directors a fixed fee and expenses of attendance may be allowed for attendance at each meeting.

INDEMNIFICATION

 (A) Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted and in the manner required, by the laws of the State of Delaware as in effect from time to time shall indemnify in accordance with the following provisions of this Article any person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding (including any appeal thereof), whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative in nature (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, if at a time when he or she was a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interests of, the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, member, trustee, fiduciary, employee or agent (a "Subsidiary Officer") of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise including any charitable or not-for-profit public service organization or trade association (an "Affiliated Entity"), against expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements), costs, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful; provided, however, that (i) the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a director or officer of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity against expenses incurred in connection with an action, suit, proceeding or investigation to which such person is threatened to be made a party but does not become a party unless such expenses were incurred with the approval of the Board of Directors, a committee thereof or the Chairman, a Vice Chairman or the President of the Corporation and (ii) the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify against any amount paid in settlement unless the Corporation has consented to such settlement. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that such person had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, a 

   ##### 

  

    

person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification
pursuant to this paragraph against costs or expenses incurred in connection
with any action, suit or proceeding commenced by such person against the
Corporation or any Affiliated Entity or any person who is or was a director,
officer, partner, member, fiduciary, employee or agent of the Corporation or
a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity in their capacity as such, but
such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in a specific case as
permitted by Section 6 of this Article. 

  

 (B) Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may indemnify any employee or agent of the Corporation in the manner and to the same or a lesser extent that it shall indemnify any director or officer under paragraph (a) above in this Section 1. 

  

 SECTION 2. INDEMNIFICATION RESPECTING DERIVATIVE CLAIMS. 

  

 (A) Indemnification of Directors and Officers. The Corporation, to the fullest extent permitted and in the manner required, by the laws of the State of Delaware as in effect from time to time shall indemnify, in accordance with the following provisions of this Article, any person who was or is made a party to or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit (including any appeal thereof) brought by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or, if at a time when he or she was a director or officer to the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interests of, the Corporation as a Subsidiary Officer of an Affiliated Entity against expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless, and only to the extent that, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such judgment was rendered shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses and costs as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a director or officer of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity against expenses incurred in connection with an action or suit to which such person is threatened to be made a party but does not become a party unless such expenses were incurred with the approval of the Board of Directors, a committee thereof, or the Chairman, a Vice Chairman or the President of the Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to this paragraph against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the right of the Corporation commenced by such Person, but such indemnification may be provided by the Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section 6 of this Article. 

  

 (B) Indemnification of Employees and Agents. The Corporation may indemnify any employee or agent of the Corporation in the manner and to the same or a lesser extent that it shall indemnify any director or officer under paragraph (a) above in this Section 2. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 3. DETERMINATION OF ENTITLEMENT TO INDEMNIFICATION  Any indemnification to be provided under Section 1 or 2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification is proper under the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in such paragraph. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification is sought or by majority vote of the members of a committee of the Board of Directors composed of at least three members each of whom is not a party to such action, suit or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable and/or such a committee is not established or obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon. In the event a request for indemnification is made by any person referred to in paragraph (a) of Section 1 or 2 of this Article, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause such determination to be made not later than 90 days after such request is made. 

  

 SECTION 4. RIGHT TO INDEMNIFICATION IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. 

  

 (A) Indemnification Upon Successful Defense. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article, to the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in any of paragraphs (a) or (b) of Section 1 or 2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith. 

  

 (B) Indemnification for Service As a Witness. To the extent any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation has served or prepared to serve as a witness in any action, suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative in nature), including any investigation by any legislative body or any regulatory or self-regulatory body by which the Corporations business is regulated, by reason of his or her services as a director or officer of the Corporation or his or her service as a Subsidiary Officer of an Affiliated Entity at a time when he or she was a director or officer of the Corporation (assuming such person is or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interests of, the Corporation as a Subsidiary Officer of such Affiliated Entity) but excluding service as a witness in an action or suit commenced by such person, the Corporation shall indemnify such person against out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and disbursements) actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection therewith and shall use its best efforts to provide such indemnity within 45 days after receipt by the Corporation from such person of a statement requesting such indemnification, averring such service and reasonably evidencing such expenses and costs; it being understood, however, that the Corporation shall have no obligation under this Article to compensate such person for such persons time or efforts so expended. The Corporation may indemnify any employee or agent of the Corporation to the same or a lesser extent as it may indemnify any director or officer of the Corporation pursuant to the foregoing sentence of this paragraph. 

   ##### 

  

  

 SECTION 5. ADVANCES OF EXPENSES. 

  

 (A) Advances to Directors and Officers. Expenses and costs, incurred by any person referred to in paragraph (a) of Section 1 or 2 of this Article in defending a civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking in writing by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified in respect of such costs and expenses by the Corporation as authorized by this Article.

 SECTION 6.
