licensing necessary, except for any such failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good
standing which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. All subsidiaries of the Company are directly or indirectly wholly owned
by the Company. &#147;<U>Material Adverse Effect</U>&#148; means any change, effect, event or occurrence
that would be materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of operations of
the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than any change or effect to the extent
resulting from (i)&nbsp;changes in general economic conditions, (ii)&nbsp;changes in laws, rules or

Corporation as a Subsidiary Officer of an Affiliated Entity against expenses (including attorneys&#146;
fees and disbursements) and costs actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection
with such action or suit if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably
believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no
indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person
shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless, and only to the extent that, the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such judgment was rendered shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the
circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such
expenses and costs as the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem
proper; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to indemnify a director or
officer of the Corporation or a Subsidiary Officer of any Affiliated Entity against expenses
incurred in connection with an action or suit to which such person is threatened to be made a party
but does not become a party unless such expenses were incurred with the approval of the Board of
Directors, a committee thereof, or the Chairman, a Vice Chairman or the President of the
Corporation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph, a person shall not be entitled, as a matter of right, to indemnification pursuant to
this paragraph against costs and expenses incurred in connection with any action or suit in the
right of the Corporation commenced by such Person, but such indemnification may be provided by the
Corporation in any specific case as permitted by Section&nbsp;6 of this Article.

provided under Section&nbsp;1 or 2 of this Article (unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction)
shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification is proper under the circumstances because such person has met the applicable

successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in
any of paragraphs (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;of Section&nbsp;1 or 2 of this Article, or in defense of any claim, issue

suit or proceeding (whether civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory or investigative in
nature), including any investigation by any legislative body or any regulatory or self-regulatory
body by which the Corporation&#146;s business is regulated, by reason of his or her services as a
director or officer of the Corporation or his or her service as a Subsidiary Officer of an
Affiliated Entity at a time when he or she was a director or officer of the Corporation (assuming
such person is or was serving at the request of, or to represent the interests of, the Corporation
as a Subsidiary Officer of such Affiliated Entity) but excluding service as a witness in an action
or suit commenced by such person, the Corporation shall indemnify such person against out-of-pocket
costs and expenses (including attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements) actually and reasonably incurred
by such person in connection therewith and shall use its best efforts to provide such indemnity
within 45&nbsp;days after receipt by the Corporation from such person of a statement requesting such
indemnification, averring such service and reasonably evidencing such expenses and costs; it being
understood, however, that the Corporation shall have no obligation under this Article to compensate
such person for such person&#146;s time or efforts so expended. The Corporation may indemnify any
employee or agent of the Corporation to the same or a lesser extent as it may indemnify any
director or officer of the Corporation pursuant to the foregoing sentence of this paragraph.
