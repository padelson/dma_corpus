  A. _The Proposed Transaction._ Upon the  terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the parties intend to  effect a strategic business combination
pursuant to which Merger  Sub will merge with and into the Company and the
separate  corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease (the  "
_Merger_ "). The Company shall be the surviving  corporation in the Merger
(the " _Surviving  Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the 
laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate existence of the  Company
with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and  franchises shall
continue unaffected by the Merger. It is the  intention of Parent that,
immediately following the Merger, each  of the following will occur in
immediate succession:  (a) the Surviving Corporation will merge with and
into  Parent with Parent being the surviving corporation (the  " _Holdco
Merger_ "), and (b) Partners  Trust Bank, a wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company  (" _Company Bank_ "), will merge with and into  MandT Bank, a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent  (" _Parent Bank_ "), with Parent Bank being the 
surviving bank (the " _Bank Merger_ "). In  addition, it is the intention of
Parent that the Transaction  constitutes and is being entered into pursuant
to a single  integrated plan. 

  



  

  B. _Board Determinations._ The respective  boards of directors of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub have  each determined that the Transaction and
the other transactions  contemplated hereby are consistent with, and will
further, their  respective business strategies and goals, and are in the
best  interests of their respective shareholders and, therefore, have 
approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated
hereby. 

  



  

  C. _Intended Tax Treatment._ The parties  intend the Transaction to be
treated as a reorganization under  Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as  amended (the " _Code_ ").

   Effect on  Stock; Election Procedures   

  



  

  3.1 _Effect on Stock._ At the  Effective Time, as a result of the Merger
and without any action  by any holder of Company Stock: 

  



  

  (a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of  Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time, other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting  Shares, will be converted into and constitute the
right to  receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in  and
subject to the provisions of Sections 3.2 and 3.3,  either (i) a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal  to $12.50 divided by the Parent Share
Price, rounded to the  nearest thousandth (the " _Per Share Stock 
Consideration_ "), or (ii) $12.50 (the " _Per  Share Cash Consideration_ ",
and together with the Per  Share Stock Consideration collectively, the  "
_Consideration_ "). 

  



  

  Shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and  will
automatically be canceled and will cease to exist. Holders  of Company Common
Stock will cease to be, and will have no  rights as, stockholders of the
Company, and certificates that  represented shares of Company Common Stock
before the Effective  Time will be deemed for all purposes to represent only
the right  to receive, without interest, (A) any then unpaid dividend  or
other distribution with respect to such Company Common Stock  having a record
date before the Effective Time and (B) the  Consideration. After the
Effective Time, there will be no  transfers of shares of Company Common Stock
on the stock  transfer books of the Company or the Surviving Corporation,
and  shares of Company Common Stock presented to the Surviving  Corporation
or Parent will be canceled and exchanged in  accordance with this Article

  3.2 _Elections;  Allocation._ (a) Subject to allocation in  accordance
with Section 3.2(b), each record holder of  Company Common Stock (other than
Excluded Shares and Dissenting  Shares) issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Election  Deadline will be entitled (1) to elect to receive in 
respect of each share of Company Common Stock (A) Per Share  Cash
Consideration (a " _Cash Election_ ") or  (B) Per Share Stock Consideration
(a " _Stock  Election_ ") or (2) to indicate that such record  holder has no
preference as to the receipt of Per Share Cash  Consideration or Per Share
Stock Consideration for each such  share (a " _Non-Election_ "). Shares of
Company  Common Stock with respect to which a Non-Election is made 
(including shares with respect of which such an election is  deemed to have
been made pursuant to this Section 3.2 and  Section 3.7) (collectively, "
_Non-Election  Shares_ ") will be deemed by Parent, in its sole and 
absolute discretion, subject to Sections 3.2(b)(1),  (2) and (3), to be, in
whole or in part, shares of Company  Common Stock with respect to which Cash
Elections or Stock  Elections have been made. Dissenting Shares will, for
purposes  of this Agreement, be treated as shares of Company Common Stock 
with respect to which Cash Elections have been made. 

  



  

  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, the
rights of holders of Company Common Stock to make  elections in respect of
shares of Company Common Stock will be  subject to the following principles
of allocation: 

  



  

  (1) _Number of Stock Elections Less Than the Stock  Conversion Number_. If
the aggregate number of  shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which
a Stock  Election is made (collectively, " _Stock Election  Shares_ ") is
less than the Stock Conversion Number, then: 

  



  

  (A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective  Time,
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock  Consideration; 

  



  

  (B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the  Non-Election Shares,
pro rata to the holders of Non-Election  Shares in accordance with their
respective numbers of  Non-Election Shares, a sufficient number of Non-
Election Shares  so that the sum of such number and the number of Stock
Election  Shares equals as closely as practicable the Stock Conversion 
Number, and each such allocated Non-Election Share (each, a  " _Stock-
Selected Non-Election Share_ ") will be,  as of the Effective Time, converted
into the 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration, _provided _ that if
the sum of all Non-Election Shares and Stock  Election Shares is equal to or
less than the Stock Conversion  Number, then all Non-Election Shares will be
Stock-Selected  Non-Election Shares; 

  



  

  (C) if the sum of Stock Election Shares and Non-Election  Shares is less
than the Stock Conversion Number, the Exchange  Agent will allocate from
among the shares of Company Common  Stock with respect to which a Cash
Election is made  (collectively, " _Cash Election Shares_ "), other  than
Cash Election Shares representing Dissenting Shares, pro  rata to the holders
of such Cash Election Shares in accordance  with their respective numbers of
Cash Election Shares, a  sufficient number of Cash Election Shares so that
the sum of  such number, the number of all Stock Election Shares and the 
number of all Non-Election Shares equals as closely as  practicable the Stock
Conversion Number, and each such allocated  Cash Election Share (each, a "
_Converted Cash Election  Share_ ") will be, as of the Effective Time,
converted  into the right to receive the Per Share Stock Consideration; and 

  



  

  (D) each Non-Election Share and Cash Election Share that is  not a Stock-
Selected Non-Election Share or a Converted Cash  Election Share (as the case
may be) will be, as of the Effective  Time, converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Cash  Consideration. 

  



  

  (2) _Number of Stock Elections Greater Than the Stock  Conversion Number_.
If the aggregate number of  Stock Election Shares is greater than the Stock
Conversion  Number, then: 

  



  

  (A) each Cash Election Share and Non-Election Share will  be, as of the
Effective Time, converted into the right to  receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration; 

  



  

  (B) the Exchange Agent will allocate from among the Stock  Election
Shares, pro rata to the holders of such Stock Election  Shares in accordance
with their respective numbers of Stock  Election Shares, a sufficient number
of Stock Election Shares  (each, a " _Converted Stock Election Share_ ") so 
that the difference of (1) the number of Stock Election  Shares minus (2) the
number of the Converted Stock Election  Shares equals as closely as
practicable the Stock Conversion  Number, and each Converted Stock Election
Share will be, as of  the Effective Time, converted into the right to receive
the Per  Share Cash Consideration; and 

  



  

  (C) each other Stock Election Share that is not a Converted  Stock
Election Share will be, as of the Effective Time,  converted into the right
to receive the Per Share Stock  Consideration. 

  



  

  (3) _Number of Stock Elections is Equal to the Stock  Conversion Number_.
If the aggregate number of  Stock Election Shares is equal to the Stock
Conversion Number,  then: 

  



  

  (A) each Stock Election Share will be, as of the Effective  Time,
converted into the right to receive the Per Share Stock  Consideration; and 

  



  

  (B) each Cash Election Share and Non-Election Share will  be, as of the
Effective Time, converted into the right to  receive the Per Share Cash
Consideration. 

  



  

  3.3 _Exchange Agent; Election  Procedures._ (a) At or before the
Effective  Time, Parent will deposit with its transfer agent or with a 
depository or trust institution of recognized standing selected  by it and
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (in such  capacity, the " _Exchange
Agent_ "), for the  benefit of the holders of certificates formerly
representing  shares of Company Common Stock (" _Old  Certificates_ "), (1)
certificates or, at  Parents option, evidence of shares in book entry form 
(" _New Certificates_ "), representing the shares  of Parent Common Stock
issuable to holders of Old Certificates  under this Article 3 and (2) cash
payable pursuant to  Sections 3.1 and 3.4 (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

  



  

  (b) Elections pursuant to Section 3.2(a) will be made  on a form and with
such other provisions to be reasonably agreed  upon by the Company and Parent
(a " _Form of  Election_ ") to be provided by the Exchange Agent for  that
purpose to holders of record of Company Common Stock (other  than holders of
Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares), together  with appropriate
transmittal materials, at the time of mailing  of the Proxy Statement to the
holders of record of Company  Common Stock or on such other date as the
Company and Parent  shall mutually agree, and thereafter from time to time as
the  Company may reasonably request until three (3) days prior  to the 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Election Deadline (as defined below), to each holder of record  of Company
Common Stock for purposes of the Company Meeting.  Elections shall be made by
mailing to the Exchange Agent a duly  completed Form of Election. A Form of
Election may specify which  specific shares covered thereby are subject to a
Cash Election,  a Stock Election or a Non-Election. To be effective, a Form
of  Election must be (1) properly completed, signed and  submitted to the
Exchange Agent at its designated office, by  5:00 p.m., on the Closing Date
(or such other time and date  as the Company and Parent may mutually agree)
(the  " _Election Deadline_ ") and (2) accompanied  by the certificate(s)
representing the shares of Company Common  Stock as to which the election is
being made (or by an  appropriate guarantee of delivery of such
certificate(s) by a  commercial bank or trust company in the United States or
a  member of a registered national security exchange or of the  NASD,
_provided_ that such certificates are in fact  delivered to the Exchange
Agent within three trading days after  the date of execution of such
guarantee of delivery). Parent  will determine, in its sole and absolute
discretion, which  authority it may delegate in whole or in part to the
Exchange  Agent, whether Forms of Election have been properly completed, 
signed and submitted or revoked. The decision of Parent (or the  Exchange
Agent, as the case may be) in such matters shall be  conclusive and binding.
Neither Parent nor the Exchange Agent  will be under any obligation to notify
any person of any defect  in a Form of Election submitted to the Exchange
Agent. A holder  of shares of Company Common Stock that does not submit an 
effective Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline shall  be deemed to
have made a Non-Election. 

  



  

  (c) An election may be revoked, but only by written notice  received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline.  Any certificate(s)
representing shares of Company Common Stock  that have been submitted to the
Exchange Agent in connection  with an election shall be returned without
charge to the holder  thereof in the event such election is revoked as
aforesaid and  such holder requests in writing the return of such 
certificate(s). Upon any such revocation, unless a duly  completed Form of
Election is thereafter submitted prior to the  Election Deadline and
otherwise in accordance with this Section,  such shares shall be deemed Non-
Election Shares. The Exchange  Agent, in consultation with Parent and the
Company, will make  all computations to give effect to this Section. 

  



  

  (d) The Exchange Agent, in consultation with Parent and the  Company, will
make all computations to give effect to  Section 3.2(b). 

  



  

  (e) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the  Effective Time,
taking into account the computations  contemplated by Section 3.2(b), but in
no event later than  ten days thereafter, each holder of record of Company
Common  Stock that has surrendered the certificates representing its 
Company Common Stock will be entitled to receive a New  Certificate
representing the shares of Parent Common Stock  issuable in exchange
therefor  and/or a  check representing cash payable pursuant to Sections
3.1  and 3.4. No interest will accrue or be paid with respect to any  New
Certificates or cash to be delivered upon surrender of Old  Certificates. If
any New Certificate is to be issued or cash is  to be paid in a name other
than that in which the Old  Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is
registered, it  will be a condition to the exchange that the person
requesting  the exchange (1) pay any transfer or other Taxes required  by
reason of the issuance of the New Certificate or the making  of the cash
payment in a name other than the name of the holder  of the surrendered Old
Certificate or (2) establish to the  satisfaction of Parent (or the Exchange
Agent, as the case may  be) that any such Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable. A  Company Affiliate shall not be entitled to receive any New 
Certificate pursuant to this Article III until such Company  Affiliate shall
have duly executed and delivered an appropriate  agreement as described in
Section 6.13. 

  



  

  (f) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the  Effective Time,
but in no event later than ten days thereafter,  Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each  person who was, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, a  holder of record of Company Common Stock and who
theretofore has  not submitted such holders Old Certificates with an 
Election Form, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall  specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and  title to Old Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery  of such certificates to the Exchange
Agent) containing  instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Old 
Certificates in exchange for the consideration to which such  person may be
entitled pursuant to this Article III. 

  



  

  (g) No dividends or other distributions with respect to  Parent Common
Stock having a record date after the Effective  Time will be paid to any
holder of Company Common Stock until  such holder has surrendered the 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Old Certificate representing such stock as provided herein.  Subject to
the effect of applicable law, following surrender of  any such Old
Certificates, there shall be paid to the holder of  New Certificates issued
in exchange therefor, without interest,  the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record  date after the Effective Time previously payable
with respect to  the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby. To
the  extent permitted by law, holders of Company Common Stock who  receive
Parent Common Stock in the Merger shall be entitled to  vote after the
Effective Time at any meeting of Parent  shareholders the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock  into which their respective shares of Company
Common Stock are  converted, regardless of whether such holders of Company
Common  Stock have exchanged their Old Certificates for New Certificates  in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, but  beginning 60 days
after the Effective Time no such Holder  shall be entitled to vote on any
matter until such Holder  surrenders such Old Certificate for exchange as
provided in  Section 3.3(b). 

  



  

  3.4 _Fractional  Shares._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in
this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock  and no
certificates or scrip therefor, or other evidence of  ownership thereof, will
be issued in the Merger; instead, Parent  will pay to each holder of Company
Common Stock who would  otherwise be entitled to a fractional share of Parent
Common  Stock (after taking into account all Old Certificates delivered  by
such holder) an amount in cash (without interest) determined  by multiplying
such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock  by the last reported per
share sale price of Parent Common  Stock, as reported by the NYSE Composite
Transactions Reporting  System for the last NYSE trading day immediately
prior to the  Closing Date. 

  



  

  3.5 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed  Certificates._ In the event any
certificate  representing shares of Company Common Stock shall have been 
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of  that fact by
the person claiming such certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the execution of  an indemnity and hold harmless
agreement in customary form with  respect to any claim that may be made
against Parent with  respect to such certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in  exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate the 
shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or  other
distributions that would be payable or deliverable in  respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen  or destroyed certificate
been surrendered. 

  



  

  3.6 _Adjustments._ If between the  date hereof and the Effective Time
there shall be a change in  the number or kind of shares of Parent Common
Stock by reason of  a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, 
reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction (or if  the Board of
Directors of Parent shall establish a record date  for such purpose), the Per
Share Stock Consideration shall, to  the extent necessary, be equitably and
proportionately adjusted  to provide the same economic effect as contemplated
by this  Agreement prior to such event. 

  



  

  3.7 _Dissenters   Rights._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  in
this Agreement, Dissenting Shares that are outstanding as of  the Effective
Time will not be converted into the right to  receive the Consideration
unless and until the holder shall have  failed to perfect, or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost,  its right to dissent from the Merger under
applicable law and to  receive such consideration as may be determined to be
due with  respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to and subject to the 
requirements of applicable law. If any such holder shall have so  failed to
perfect or have effectively withdrawn or lost such  right after the Election
Deadline, each share of such  holders Company Common Stock shall thereupon
be treated as  a Non-Election Share and will be deemed to have been
converted  into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to 
receive, without any interest thereon, the Per Share Stock  Consideration or
the Per Share Cash Consideration, or a  combination thereof, as determined by
Parent in its sole  discretion. The Company will give Parent (a) prompt
notice  of any notice or demands for appraisal or payment for shares of 
Company Common Stock received by the Company and (b) the  opportunity to
participate in and direct all negotiations and  proceedings with respect to
any such demands or notices. The  Company will not, without the prior written
consent of Parent,  settle, offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any
such  demands. Parent will pay any consideration as may be determined  to be
due with respect to Dissenting Shares pursuant to and  subject to the
requirements of applicable law.

knowingly take, or knowingly omit to take, any action  that is reasonably
likely to result in any of the conditions to  the Merger set forth in Article

as Previously  Disclosed, without the prior written consent of the Company,
it  will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries not to: 

  



  

  (a) _Adverse Actions_. Notwithstanding any  other provision hereof, (1)
knowingly take, or knowingly  omit to take, directly or indirectly, any
action that would, or  is reasonably likely to, prevent or impede the Merger

indirectly, any action that  is reasonably likely to result in any of the

dates and record dates. Parent hereby acknowledges that, upon  the
consummation of the Transaction, if the Company Board  properly declares a
dividend on the Company Common Stock in  compliance with applicable law, its
organizational documents and  this Section 4.3, and the Closing Date occurs
after the  record date for such dividend but prior to the payment date for 
such dividend, such declared but unpaid dividend shall be deemed  to
constitute debt claims of the holders of record of Company  Common Stock on
such record date and, accordingly, Parent shall  cause such dividend to be
paid.

more covenants  contained in Article 4 or Article 6 or one or more 
representations or warranties contained in this Article 5;  _provided_ that

that accrued on or before the end of the most recent period  covered by its
Company SEC Filings filed before the date hereof.  As of the date hereof,
neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has any reason to believe
that any conditions exist  that could reasonably be expected to prevent or
impede the  Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning
of  Section 368(a) of the Code. No Liens for Taxes exist with  respect to
any of the Companys assets or properties or  those of its Subsidiaries,

not aware  of circumstances reasonably likely to result in the loss of the 
qualification of such Pension Plan under Section 401(a) of  the Code. There

material. 

  



  

  (3) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of  ERISA has been or
is reasonably expected to be incurred by it or  any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or  terminated "single-employer plan", within
the meaning  of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly 
maintained by any of them, or the single-employer plan of any  entity that is
considered one employer with it under  Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414

Subsidiaries or any of its ERISA Affiliates has contributed to a 
"multiemployer plan", within the meaning of  Section 3(37) of ERISA, at any
time within the last six  years. No notice of a "reportable event", within

Benefit Arrangements have been timely made and all  obligations in respect of
each of its Benefits Arrangements have  been properly accrued or reflected on
its most recent  consolidated financial statements included in its Company
SEC  Filings. None of its 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Pension Plans or any single-employer plan of any of its ERISA  Affiliates
has an "accumulated funding deficiency"  (whether or not waived) within the
meaning of Section 412  of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and none of its
ERISA  Affiliates has an outstanding funding waiver. Neither it nor any  of
its Subsidiaries has provided, or is required to provide,  security to any of
its Pension Plans or to any single-employer  plan of any of its ERISA
Affiliates pursuant to Section  401(a)(29) of the Code. 

  



  

  (5) Under each Pension Plan that is a single-employer plan,  as of the
last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to  the date hereof, the
actuarially determined present value of all  "benefit liabilities", within
the meaning of  Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of 
the actuarial assumptions contained in such Pension Plans  most recent
actuarial valuation), did not exceed the then  current value of the assets of
such Pension Plan, and there has  been no change in the financial condition
of such Pension Plan  since the last day of the most recent plan year. 

  



  

  (6) Neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries has any  obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any  Benefit Arrangement or collective
bargaining agreement. Either  it or its Subsidiaries may amend or terminate
any such plan at  any time without incurring any liability thereunder other
than  in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or 
termination. 

  



  

  (7) Neither its execution of this Agreement, the  performance of its
obligations hereunder, the consummation of  the transactions contemplated
hereby, nor shareholder approval  of the transactions contemplated hereby,
will (A) limit or  restrict its right, or, following the consummation of
the  transactions contemplated hereby, Parents right, to  administer, merge
or amend in any respect or terminate any of  its Benefit Arrangements, (B)
entitle any of its employees  or any employees of its Subsidiaries to
severance pay or any  increase in severance pay upon any termination of
employment  after the date hereof, or (C) accelerate the time of  payment or
vesting or result in any payment or funding (through  a grantor trust or
otherwise) of compensation or benefits under,  increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material  obligation pursuant to, any of its Benefit
Arrangements. Except  as Previously Disclosed, without limiting the
foregoing, as a  result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  hereby (including as a result of the termination of the 
employment of any of its employees within a specified time of  the Effective
Time) neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries will  be obligated to make a
payment to an individual that would be a  "parachute payment" to a
"disqualified  individual" as those terms are defined in Section 280G  of
the Code, without regard to whether such payment is  reasonable compensation
for personal services performed or to be  performed in the future. 

  



  

  (8) All Benefit Arrangements that are "nonqualified  deferred compensation
plans" (within the meaning of  Section 409A of the Code) have been maintained
and  administered in good faith compliance with the requirements of  Section
409A of the Code and any regulations or other  guidance issued thereunder.

its  Subsidiaries, and such property and assets are not subject to  any
Liens except mechanics, workmens,  repairmens, warehousemens, carriers

related thereto, relating to any real property owned  by it or its
Subsidiaries.

occurred or fact or  circumstance has arisen that, individually or taken
together  with all other events, facts, and circumstances (described in  any

have a Material Adverse Effect with respect  to Parent or Merger Sub.

  (l) _Compliance with Laws_. Parent and each  of its Subsidiaries: 

  



  

  (1) operates and conducts its business in compliance with  all applicable

control of Parent or  its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means of
access  thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership  and
non-direct control that would not reasonably be expected to  have a
materially adverse effect on the system of internal  accounting controls

established and maintain a system of  internal accounting controls sufficient
to provide reasonable  assurances regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with

  (q) _Ownership of Company Common  Stock_. Parent, together with its 
"Affiliates" and "Associates," is not, nor  at any time during the last three

statements, respectively. 

  



  

   ARTICLE 6 
   

  



  

   Covenants   

  



  

  6.1 _Reasonable Best  Efforts._ (a) Subject to the terms and  conditions
of this Agreement, the Company and Parent will use  reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, in good  faith, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things  necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable
under applicable  laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger and the
Other  Mergers as promptly as practicable and otherwise to enable 
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and each  will
cooperate fully with, and furnish information to, the other  party to that
end. In connection with the Companys and  Parents respective obligations to
cooperate and cause the  conversion of the operating systems of the Company
Bank to the  operating systems of Parent Bank at the Effective Time, the 
Company shall, commencing as of the date of this Agreement,  provide Parent
and Parent Bank with full 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  access to the Company Banks offices, systems and  facilities and all
relevant information and personnel at such  times and places as Parent Bank
shall request (in connection  therewith, the parties shall cooperate towards
causing the least  possible disruption to the Companys and Company  Banks
employees, customers and operations), allow Parent  Bank to implement such
changes as shall be reasonably necessary  to effect the conversion at the
Effective Time and diligently  assist Parent Bank in making and sending
notices, information  and materials to the customers and service providers of
the  Company and its Subsidiaries at such times as Parent deems  appropriate
and otherwise preparing for the conversion.  (b) The Company and Parent will
give prompt notice to the  other of any fact, event or circumstance known to
it that  (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together  with all
other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to  result in any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to it or  (ii) would cause or constitute a breach
of any of its  representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained  herein that reasonably could be expected to give rise, 
individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition  in Article
7. 

  



  

  6.2 _Stockholder  Approval._ (a) The Company Board has adopted 
resolutions recommending to the Companys stockholders  approval of this
Agreement, the Merger and any other matters  required to be approved or
adopted in order to effect the Merger  and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. 

  



  

  (b) The Company Board will submit to its shareholders this  Agreement, the
Merger and any other matters required to be  approved or adopted by such
shareholders in order to carry out  the intentions of this Agreement. In
furtherance of that  obligation, the Company will take, in accordance with
applicable  law and its Constituent Documents, all action necessary to 
convene a meeting of its stockholders (including any adjournment  or
postponement, the " _Company Meeting_ ") as  promptly as practicable to
consider and vote upon approval of  this Agreement, the Merger and any such
other matters. The  Company and the Company Board will use its reasonable
best  efforts to obtain from its stockholders a vote adopting and  approving
this Agreement, the Merger and any such other matters,  including by
recommending that its shareholders vote in favor of  this Agreement, the
Merger and any such other matters. However,  if the Company Board, after
consultation with (and based on the  advice of) counsel, determines in good
faith that, because of  the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board  concludes in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, it 
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable  law to
continue to recommend this Agreement and the Merger,  then, in submitting
this Agreement and the Merger to the Company  Meeting, the Company Board may
submit such items without  recommendation (although the resolutions adopting
such items  prior to the date hereof, described in Section 6.2(a), may  not
be rescinded or amended), in which event the Company Board  may communicate
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to  the stockholders in the Proxy
Statement or an appropriate  amendment or supplement thereto to the extent
required by law;  _provided_ that the Company Board may not take any
actions  under this sentence until after giving Parent at least 10  business
days to respond to such Acquisition Proposal (and after  giving Parent notice
of the third party in the Acquisition  Proposal and the latest material terms
and conditions of the  Acquisition Proposal) and then taking into account any
amendment  or modification to this Agreement proposed by Parent. 

  



  

  6.3 _Regulatory  Applications._ (a) The Company and Parent and  their
respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use reasonable  best efforts to
prepare as promptly as practicable all  documentation, to make all filings
and to obtain all consents,  approvals, permits and other authorizations of
all Governmental  Authorities and third parties to consummate the Merger and
the  other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Other  Mergers
(the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ ").  Each of the Company and Parent
will have the right to review in  advance, and to the extent practicable each
will consult with  the other, in each case subject to applicable laws
relating to  the exchange of information, with respect to all material 
written information submitted to any third party or any  Governmental
Authority in connection with the Requisite  Regulatory Approvals. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of  the parties will act reasonably and
as promptly as practicable.  Each party agrees that it will consult with the
other party with  respect to obtaining all material permits, consents,
approvals  and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental 
Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate the  transactions
contemplated hereby and each party will keep the  other party appraised of
the status of material matters relating  to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Parent  agrees that it shall file the required
applications and notices,  as applicable, to the Federal Reserve Board under
the BHC Act,  to the Office of Thrift Supervision under HOLA, and
applications  and notices to the New York State Banking Department or
Banking  Board under the NYBL within 45 days of the date hereof;  _provided,
however_ , that Parent shall not be deemed to  have breached the foregoing to
the extent it failed to file such  applications due to the failure of the
Company to promptly  furnish to Parent all information concerning 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  the Company, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and  shareholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably  necessary or advisable in connection
with any such notice or  application, as applicable, as requested by Parent.
In addition,  the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, at the request of 
Parent, assist Parent in the preparation of  and/or  prepare, as applicable,
all documentation, assist Parent in  making  and/or make,  as applicable,
all filings and assist Parent in obtaining  and/or  obtain, as applicable,
all consents, approvals, permits and  other authorizations of all
Governmental Authorities and third  parties, in each case, as promptly as
practicable following such  request, in order to convert the Company Bank
into a New York  chartered commercial bank effective immediately after the 
Effective Time. 

  



  

  (b) The Company and Parent will, upon request, furnish the  other party
with all information concerning itself, its  Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such  other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in  connection with any filing, notice or application
made by or on  behalf of such other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or
to  any third party or Governmental Authority in connection with the 
transactions contemplated hereby. 

  



  

  6.4 _Exchange Listing._ Parent will  use all reasonable best efforts to
cause the shares of Parent  Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for  listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance,
as  promptly as practicable, and in any event before the Effective  Time. 

  



  

  6.5 _SEC Filings._ (a) Parent  will prepare a registration statement on 
Form S-4  or other applicable form (the " _Registration  Statement_ ") to be
filed by Parent with the SEC in  connection with the issuance of Parent
Common Stock in the  Merger (including the notice, proxy statement and
prospectus and  other proxy solicitation materials of the Company
constituting a  part thereof (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and all  related
documents). The parties agree to cooperate, and to cause  their Subsidiaries
to cooperate, with the other party, its  counsel and its accountants, in the
preparation of the  Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. Each of
Parent  and the Company will use all reasonable best efforts to cause  the
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the  Securities Act as
promptly as reasonably practicable after  filing thereof and to maintain the
effectiveness of such  Registration Statement until the Effective Time.
Parent also  agrees to use all reasonable best efforts to obtain all 
necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits  and approvals required
to carry out the transactions  contemplated hereby. The Company agrees to
furnish to Parent all  information concerning the Company, its Subsidiaries,
officers,  directors and stockholders as may be reasonably requested in 
connection with the foregoing. 

  



  

  (b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and  its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be  supplied by it
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in  (1) the Registration
Statement will, at the time the  Registration Statement and each amendment or
supplement thereto,  if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act,
contain any  untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any 
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make  the
statements therein not misleading and (2) the Proxy  Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the  date of mailing to shareholders
and at the time of the Company  Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit  to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or  necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the 
circumstances under which such statement was made, not  misleading. The
Company and Parent each further agrees that if  it becomes aware that any
information furnished by it would  cause any of the statements in the Proxy
Statement or the  Registration Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to  any material fact, or to omit to state any material fact 
necessary to make the statements therein not false or  misleading, to
promptly inform the other party thereof and to  take appropriate steps to
correct the Proxy Statement or the  Registration Statement. 

  



  

  (c) Parent will advise the Company, promptly after Parent  receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration  Statement has become effective or
any supplement or amendment  has been filed, of the issuance of any stop
order or the  suspension of the qualification of Parent Common Stock for 
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation or  threat of any
proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request  by the SEC for the
amendment or supplement of the Registration  Statement or for additional
information. 

  



  

  6.6 _Press Releases._ The Company and  Parent will consult with each other
before issuing any press  release, written employee communication or other
written  shareholder communication with respect to the Merger or this 
Agreement and will not issue any such communication or make any  such public
statement without the prior consent of the other  party, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed;  _provided_ that a party may, without the
prior 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the  extent
practicable in the circumstances), issue such  communication or make such
public statement as may be required  by applicable law or securities exchange
rules. The Company and  Parent will cooperate to develop all public
communications and  make appropriate members of management available at 
presentations related to the transactions contemplated hereby as  reasonably
requested by the other party. 

  



  

  6.7 _Acquisition Proposals._ The  Company agrees that it will not, and
will cause its Subsidiaries  and its and its Subsidiaries officers,
directors, agents,  advisors and affiliates not to, solicit or encourage
inquiries  or proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations 
concerning, or provide any confidential non-public information  to, or have
any discussions with, any person relating to, any  Acquisition Proposal;
_provided_ that, in the event the  Company receives an unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal and the  Company Board concludes in good faith that such
Acquisition  Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may, and 
may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries  Representatives
to, furnish or cause to be furnished nonpublic  information and participate
in such negotiations or discussions  to the extent that the Company Board
concludes in good faith  (and based on the advice of counsel) that failure to
take such  actions would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under 
applicable law; _provided_ that, prior to providing any  nonpublic
information permitted to be provided pursuant to the  foregoing proviso, it
shall have entered into a confidentiality  agreement with such third party on
terms no less favorable to it  than the Confidentiality Agreement (without
regard to any  modification thereof pursuant hereto or lapse of time). The 
Company will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any  activities,
discussions or negotiations conducted before the  date of this Agreement with
any persons other than Parent with  respect to any Acquisition Proposal and
will use its reasonable  best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or
similar agreement  relating to an Acquisition Proposal. The Company will
within one  business day advise Parent following receipt of any Acquisition 
Proposal and the substance thereof will keep Parent apprised of  any related
developments on a current basis. Nothing contained  in this Section 6.7 or
elsewhere shall prevent the Company  from complying with  Rule 14d-9  and 
Rule 14e-2  under the Exchange Act with regard to any Acquisition Proposal. 

  



  

  6.8 _Takeover Laws and  Provisions._ The Company will not take any
action  that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be  subject
to requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and will  take all necessary
steps within its control to exempt (or ensure  the continued exemption of)
those transactions from, or if  necessary challenge the validity or
applicability of, any  applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in
effect. 

  



  

  6.9 _Access;  Information._ (a) The Company agrees that  upon reasonable
notice and subject to applicable laws relating  to the exchange of
information, it will (and will cause its  Subsidiaries to) afford Parent, and
Parents officers,  employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized 
Representatives, such access during normal business hours  throughout the
period before the Effective Time to the books,  records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work  papers of independent auditors),
properties, personnel and to  such other information as Parent may reasonably
request and,  during such period, it will furnish promptly to Parent  (1) a
copy of each report, schedule and other document  filed by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state  banking or securities laws, and (2) all
other information  concerning the business, properties and personnel of it
as  Parent may reasonably request. 

  



  

  (b) No investigation by Parent of the business and affairs  of the
Company, pursuant to this Section 6.9 or otherwise,  will affect or be deemed
to modify or waive any representation,  warranty, covenant or agreement in
this Agreement, or the  conditions to Parents obligation to consummate the 
transactions contemplated hereby. 

  



  

  (c) Each of Parent and the Company will hold any  information it may
obtain from the other in connection with this  Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby which is  nonpublic and confidential to the extent
required by, and in  accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  



  

  6.10 _Restructuring Charges._ The  Company and Parent will consult with
respect to the character,  amount and timing of restructuring charges to be
taken by the  Company in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby  and the Company shall take such charges in accordance with GAAP,  as
may be mutually agreed upon in a written agreement executed  in the same
manner as this agreement that specifically  references this Section 6.10;
_provided_ that no such  charges need be effected until Parent shall have
irrevocably  certified to the Company that all conditions set forth in 
Article VII to the obligation of Parent to consummate the  Merger
contemplated hereby have been satisfied or, where legally  permissible,
waived. No partys representations, warranties  and covenants contained 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  in this Agreement shall be deemed to be untrue or breached in  any respect
for any purpose as a consequence of any  modifications or changes to such
policies and practices which  may be undertaken on account of this Section
6.10. 

  



  

  6.11 _Supplemental Indentures._ At or  before the Effective Time, Parent
will execute and deliver, or  cause to be executed and delivered, by or on
behalf of Parent,  one or more supplemental indentures and other
instruments  required for the due assumption of the Companys  outstanding
debt, guarantees, securities, and (to the extent  informed of such
requirement by the Company) other agreements to  the extent required by the
terms of such debt, guarantees,  securities or other agreements. 

  



  

  6.12 _Company Stock Options and Stock Awards;  Benefit Arrangements_. 

  



  

  (a) _Treatment of Company Stock Options and Company Stock  Awards_. (1)
Neither Parent nor any  Subsidiary of Parent shall assume any Company Stock
Options,  Company Stock Awards or Company Stock Plans in connection with 
the Merger and the Company shall provide for the  fifteen-day  exercise
period as contemplated by Section 17.3 of the  Companys Long-Term Equity
Compensation Plan. The parties  hereto acknowledge and agree that the
provisions of this  Section 6.12(a) shall not constitute or be deemed to 
constitute a provision "for the continuation of the Plan,  or the assumption
of such Options, Restricted Stock and  Restricted Stock Units theretofore
Granted, or for the  substitution for such Options, Restricted Stock and
Restricted  Stock Units of new options, restricted stock, or restricted 
stock units covering the stock of a successor corporation, or a  parent or
subsidiary thereof" for purposes of  Section 17.3(ii) of the Companys Long-
Term Equity  Compensation Plan. Immediately after the Effective Time, each 
Company Stock Option that was not exercised prior to the  Effective Time,
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled and shall  only entitle the holder of
such Company Stock Option to receive,  as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time (and  in any event within ten (10) business days),
an amount in  cash equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares 
of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option  (without regard
to any vesting provisions thereof) times  (y) the excess, if any, of the Per
Share Cash Consideration  over the exercise price per share under such
Company Stock  Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with 
respect to such payment. Immediately after the Effective Time,  each right of
any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or  receive shares of Company
Common Stock or benefits measured by  the value of shares of Company Common
Stock, and each award of  any kind consisting of shares of Company Common
Stock that may  be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for
issuance  under the Company Stock Plans and any other benefit plans of the 
Company, other than Company Stock Options (the " _Company  Stock Awards_ "),
shall be cancelled and shall only  entitle the holder of such Company Stock
Award to receive, as  soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time
(and in  any event within ten (10) business days), an amount in cash  equal
to (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock  subject to such Company
Stock Award immediately prior to the  Effective Time (without regard to any
vesting provisions  thereof) times (y) the Per Share Cash Consideration (or,
if  the Company Stock Award provides for payments to the extent the  value
of the shares of Company Common Stock exceed a specified  reference price,
the amount, if any, by which the Per Share Cash  Consideration exceeds such
reference price), less applicable  Taxes required to be withheld with respect
to such payment. 

  



  

  (2) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the  board of
directors of the Company and the compensation committee  of the board of
directors of the Company, as applicable, shall  adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary  to effectuate the provision in
subsection 6.12(a)(1) above. The  Company shall take all actions necessary to
ensure that after  the Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation  will be required to deliver shares of Company Common Stock or 
other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant to or  in
settlement of Company Stock Options or Company Stock Awards. 

  



  

  (3) To the extent that amounts are so withheld in respect  of Taxes by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may  be, pursuant to subsection
6.12(a)(1) above, such withheld  amounts (i) shall be remitted by Parent or
the Surviving  Corporation, as applicable, to the applicable governmental 
entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this  Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of Company Stock  Options or Company Stock
Awards in respect of which such  deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation  or Parent, as the case may be. 

  



  

  (4) As soon as practicable following the execution of this  Agreement, the
Company shall mail to each person who is a holder  of Company Stock Options
or Company Stock Awards a letter  approved in advance by Parent 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  describing the treatment of and payment for such Company Stock  Options
pursuant to this Section 6.12 and providing  instructions for use in
obtaining payment for such Company Stock  Options or Company Stock Awards. 

  



  

  (b) Upon the request of Parent, the Company will take all  action
necessary, including adopting resolutions of the Company  Board, to terminate
any employee benefit plan covering employees  of the Company, including the
Companys Employee Savings  Plan, effective immediately prior to the
Effective Time, or to  facilitate the merger of any such employee benefit
plan into an  employee benefit plan of the Parent. In connection with the 
Companys Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust (the  " _Company ESOP_ "),
the Company will take all such  actions as are required to facilitate (i) the
repayment of  any outstanding indebtedness owing to it by the Company ESOP
as  of the Effective Time, and (ii) the termination of the  Company ESOP and
the distribution of the remaining Company ESOP  assets to participants of the
Company ESOP as soon as  practicable subsequent to the Effective Time. 

  



  

  (c) Parent agrees that following the Effective Time,  employees of the
Company as of the Effective Time will be  provided with pension and welfare
benefits under employee  benefit plans that in the aggregate are
substantially comparable  to those provided by Parent to its similarly
situated employees,  as in effect from time to time; _provided_ that
employees  covered by collective bargaining agreements need not be provided 
with such benefits. It is specifically provided that such  employees of the
Company who become employees of Parent will not  participate in Parents
defined benefit pension plan as  participation in that plan has been limited
to those employees  of Parent who were participants of that plan as of 
December 31, 2005 and who elected to remain in that plan.  Parent will cause
each employee benefit plan of Parent in which  employees of the Company as of
the Effective Time are eligible  to participate to take into account for all
purposes (including  eligibility, vesting and level of benefits) thereunder
(other  than for purposes of benefits accrual under a defined benefit  plan
of Parent) the service of such employees with the Company  as if such service
were with Parent, to the same extent that  such service was credited under a
comparable plan of the  Company, and, with respect to welfare benefit plans
of Parent in  which employees of the Company are eligible to participate, 
Parent agrees to waive any preexisting conditions, waiting  periods and
actively at work requirements under such plans. For  purposes of each Parent
health plan, Parent shall cause any  eligible expenses incurred by employees
of the Company and their  covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the  comparable plan of the Company ending on the date such 
employees participation in the corresponding Parent plan  begins to be taken
into account under such Parent plan for  purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum  out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his  covered dependents for the applicable plan year of
Parent plan.  Parent agrees that employees of the Company as of the
Effective  Time who are terminated during the period commencing at the 
Effective Time and ending on the one-year anniversary thereof  will be
entitled to receive severance payments in accordance  with the Company Banks
Employee Change of Control  Severance Plan (the " _Company Bank Severance 
Plan_ ") unless they have an agreement that otherwise  provides for
severance, in which case severance shall be  specifically governed by such
agreement. Parent also agrees that  employees of the Company as of the
Effective Time who work less  than 35 hours per week and are not eligible to
receive  severance payments under the Company Bank Severance Plan who are 
terminated during the period commencing at the Effective Time  and ending on
the one-year anniversary thereof will be entitled  to receive a lump-sum cash
severance payment in accordance with  and to the extent provided in Parents
Severance Pay Plan. 

  



  

  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein  shall (1) be
treated as an amendment of any particular  Benefit Arrangement, (2) give any
third party any right to  enforce the provisions of this Section 6.12 or 
(3) obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of  their affiliates to
(i) maintain any particular benefit  plan or (ii) retain the employment of
any particular  Employee. 

  



  

  6.13 _Affiliate Agreements._ Not  later than the fifteenth day before the
mailing of the Proxy  Statement, the Company will deliver to Parent a
schedule of each  person that, to the best of its knowledge, is or is
reasonably  likely to be, as of the date of the Company Meeting, deemed to 
be an "affiliate" of Company (each, a " _Company  Affiliate_ ") as that term
is used in Rule 145 under  the Securities Act. The Company will use its
reasonable best  efforts to cause each person who may be deemed to be a
Company  Affiliate to execute and deliver to Parent and the Company on or 
before the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement an agreement  in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Annex 1_. 

  



  

  6.14 _Indemnification._ (a) Following  the Effective Time, Parent will
indemnify, defend and hold  harmless the present directors and officers (when
acting in such  capacity) of the Company (each, an " _Indemnified  Party_ ")
against all costs or expenses (including  reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses,  claims, damages or 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") as  incurred, and will advance
expenses, in connection with any  claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil,  criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of  actions or omissions occurring at or before the Effective
Time  (including the transactions contemplated hereby), in accordance  with
the Constituent Documents of the Company in effect on the  date hereof, to
the extent permitted under applicable law. 

  



  

  (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification  under Section
6.14(a), upon learning of any claim, action,  suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, will promptly  notify Parent; _provided_ that
failure so to notify will  not affect the obligations of Parent under Section
6.14(a)  unless and to the extent that Parent is actually and materially 
prejudiced as a consequence. 

  



  

  (c) For a period of six years following the Effective Time,  Parent shall
obtain a directors and officers  liability insurance policy that serves to
reimburse the present  and former officers and directors of the Company or of
any of  its Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with  respect
to claims against such directors and officers arising  from fact or events
which occurred before the Effective Time,  which insurance shall contain at
least the same coverage and  amounts, and contain terms and conditions no
less advantageous,  as that coverage currently provided by the Company;
_provided, _ that in no event shall Parent be required to expend more  than
200% of the current amount expended by the Company (the  " _Current Premium_
") to maintain or procure such  directors and officers insurance coverage
for a  comparable six-year period; _provided_ , _further_ ,  that if Parent
is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance  called for by this Section
6.14(c), Parent shall use its  reasonable best efforts to obtain as much
comparable insurance  as is available for 200% of the Current Premium; 
_provided_ , _further_ , that officers and directors of  the Company or any
subsidiary may be required to make  application and provide customary
representations and warranties  to the responsible insurance carrier for the
purpose of  obtaining such insurance. 

  



  

  (d) If Parent or any of its successors or assigns  consolidates with or
merges into any other entity and is not the  continuing or surviving entity
of such consolidation or merger  or transfers all or substantially all of its
assets to any other  entity, then and in each case, but only to the extent
not  effected by operation of law, Parent will cause proper provision  to be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent will  assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.14. 

  



  

  (e) The provisions of this Section 6.14 shall survive  the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of,  and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or  her heirs and Representatives.

its  Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes  of this

contemplated hereby is  denied by final, nonappealable action of such
Governmental  Authority; _provided_ that the right to terminate this 
Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) shall not be available  to any party
whose failure to comply with any provision of this  Agreement has been the

the right  to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(e) shall  not

relieve a party  from liability for any willful breach by it of this
Agreement. 

  



  

  8.3 _Fee._ (a) The Company will pay to  Parent a cash termination fee (the

  Ladies and Gentlemen: 

  



  

  Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as  of July
18, 2007 (as amended, the "Merger  Agreement"), among Partners Trust
Financial Group,  Inc. (the "Company"), MandT Bank Corporation  ("Parent") and
MTB One, Inc. ("Merger Sub").  The Merger Agreement provides, _inter alia_ ,
for the merger  of the Merger Sub with and into the Company, with Company
being  the surviving entity (the "Merger"). Each share of the  Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time,
other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting  Shares, will be converted into and
constitute the right to  receive, at the election of the holder thereof as
provided in  and subject to the provisions of Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of  the
Merger Agreement, either (i) the Per Share Stock  Consideration or (ii) the
Per Share Cash Consideration.  This Letter Agreement (this "Letter
Agreement") is  being entered into pursuant to Section 6.13 of the Merger 
Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have  the meanings
assigned to them in the Merger Agreement. 

  



  

  I have been advised that (i) the Merger constitutes a  transaction covered
by Rule 145 under the Securities Act of  1933, as amended (including the
rules and regulations  thereunder, the "Securities Act"), and (ii) I may  be
deemed to be an affiliate of the Company, as the term  "affiliate" is defined
for purposes of Rule 145  under the Securities Act; and that, accordingly,
the shares of  Parent Common Stock that I may acquire in exchange for the 
Company Common Stock in the Merger may be disposed of only in  accordance
with the provisions of Rule 145 under the  Securities Act, pursuant to an
effective registration statement  under the Securities Act or in accordance
with a legal opinion  in form and substance satisfactory to Parent that
such  disposition is otherwise exempt from the registration  requirements of
such Act. 

  



  

  I hereby represent and warrant to and covenant with, as  applicable,
Parent as follows: 

  



  

  1. I have full power to execute this Letter Agreement, to  make the
representations, warranties and agreements herein and  to perform my
obligations hereunder. 

  



  

  2. I have carefully read this Letter Agreement and, to the  extent I felt
necessary, discussed its requirements and other  applicable limitations upon
my ability to sell, transfer or  otherwise dispose of shares of Parent Common
Stock with my  counsel or counsel for the Company. 

  



  

  3. In the event I receive any shares of Parent Common Stock  in exchange
for shares of the Company Common Stock as a result  of the consummation of
the Merger, or any securities which may  be paid as a dividend or otherwise
distributed thereon or with  respect thereto or issued or delivered in
exchange or  substitution therefor, or any right or other interest (all
such  shares and securities being referred to herein as  "Restricted
Securities"), and with respect to any such  Restricted Securities: 

  



  

  (A) I will not make any sale, transfer or other disposition  of Restricted
Securities unless (i) such sale, transfer or  other disposition has been
registered under the Securities Act,  (ii) such sale, transfer or other
disposition is made in  conformity with the volume and other limitations
imposed by  Rule 145 under the Securities Act and, if I am or have been  an
"affiliate" of Parent, Rule 144 under the  Securities Act, or (iii) in the
opinion of counsel  reasonably acceptable to Parent, such sale, transfer or
other  disposition is otherwise exempt from registration under the 
Securities Act. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  (B) I understand that Parent is under no obligation to  register the sale,
transfer or other disposition of shares of  Parent Common Stock or other
Restricted Securities by me or on  my behalf under the Securities Act or to
take any other action  necessary in order to make compliance with an
exemption from  such registration available. 

  



  

  (C) I understand that the Restricted Securities will be  issued to me in
certificated form. I also understand that stop  transfer instructions will be
given to Parents transfer  agent with respect to the Restricted Securities
issued to me as  a result of the Merger and that there will be placed on
the  certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, or any 
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance: 

  



  

  "The shares represented by this certificate were issued in  a transaction
to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of  1933 applies. The shares
represented by this certificate may be  sold or transferred only (1) in
compliance with the  requirements of Rule 145 under such Act, (2) pursuant 
to an effective registration statement under such Act, or  (3) in accordance
with a legal opinion in form and  substance satisfactory to MandT Bank
Corporation that such  sale or transfer is otherwise exempt from the
registration  requirements of such Act." 

  



  

  (D) Unless a transfer of Restricted Securities is a sale  made in
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) and,  if I am or have been an
"affiliate" of Parent,  Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or made pursuant
to any  effective registration statement under the Securities Act,  Parent
reserves the right to put the following legend on the  certificate issued to
my transferee: 

  



  

  "The shares represented by this certificate have not been  registered
under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired  from a person who
received such shares in a transaction to which  Rule 145 under the Securities
Act of 1933 applies. The  shares have been acquired by the holder not with a
view to, or  for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof within 
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be  offered, sold,
pledged or otherwise transferred except in  accordance with an exemption from
the registration requirements  of the Securities Act of 1933." 

  



  

  (E) It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth  in paragraphs
C and D above, as the case may be, shall be  removed by delivery of
substitute certificates without such  legend,  and/or the  issuance of a
letter to Parents transfer agent removing  such stop transfer instructions,
and the above restrictions on  sale will cease to apply, if I shall have
delivered to Parent  (i) a copy of a letter from the staff of the Securities
and  Exchange Commission, or an opinion of counsel in form and  substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or other evidence  reasonably satisfactory
to Parent, to the effect that such  legend  and/or stop  transfer
instructions are not required for purposes of the  Securities Act or (ii)
reasonably satisfactory evidence or  representations that the securities
represented by such  certificates are being or have been transferred in a
transaction  made in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 under  the
Securities Act and, if I am or have been an  "affiliate" of Parent, Rule 144
under the  Securities Act or pursuant to an effective registration under 
the Securities Act. 

  



  

  4. I recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also  apply to (A)
my spouse, (B) any relative of mine or my  spouse occupying my home, (C) any
trust or estate in  which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least
10%  beneficial interest or of which any of us serves as trustee,  executor
or in any similar capacity and (D) any corporation  or other organization in
which I, my spouse or any such  relative owns at least 10% of any class of
equity securities or  of the equity interest. It is understood that this
Letter  Agreement shall be binding upon and enforceable against my 
administrators, executors, representatives, heirs, legatees and  devisees,
and any pledgee holding securities restricted pursuant  to this Letter
Agreement. 

  



  

  5. Execution of this Letter Agreement should not be  construed as an
admission on my part that I am an  "affiliate" of the Company, as described
in the second  paragraph of this Letter Agreement, or as a waiver of any
rights  I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on  or
after the date of this Letter Agreement. 

  



  

  6. I understand that nothing in this Letter Agreement  restricts Parent
from applying its usual practices and  procedures regarding the issuance of
shares to directors and  executive officers with respect to securities issued
other than  in connection with the consummation of the Merger. 

  



  

  7. This Letter Agreement shall terminate and be of no  further force and
effect if the Merger Agreement is terminated  pursuant to the terms
thereof.
