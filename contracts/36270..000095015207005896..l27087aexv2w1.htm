    A.&#160;<I>The Proposed Transaction.</I>&#160;&#160;Upon the
    terms and conditions of this Agreement, the parties intend to
    effect a strategic business combination pursuant to which Merger
    Sub will merge with and into the Company and the separate
    corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease (the
    &#147;<I>Merger</I>&#148;). The Company shall be the surviving
    corporation in the Merger (the &#147;<I>Surviving
    Corporation</I>&#148;) and shall continue to be governed by the
    laws of the State of Delaware, and the separate existence of the
    Company with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and
    franchises shall continue unaffected by the Merger. It is the
    intention of Parent that, immediately following the Merger, each
    of the following will occur in immediate succession:
    (a)&#160;the Surviving Corporation will merge with and into
    Parent with Parent being the surviving corporation (the
    &#147;<I>Holdco Merger</I>&#148;), and (b)&#160;Partners

    addition, it is the intention of Parent that the Transaction
    constitutes and is being entered into pursuant to a single
    integrated plan.

    Option less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with

    each right of any kind, contingent or accrued, to acquire or
    receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits measured by
    the value of shares of Company Common Stock, and each award of
    any kind consisting of shares of Company Common Stock that may
    be held, awarded, outstanding, payable or reserved for issuance
    under the Company Stock Plans and any other benefit plans of the

    equal to (x)&#160;the number of shares of Company Common Stock
    subject to such Company Stock Award immediately prior to the

    (c)&#160;Parent agrees that following the Effective Time,

    to those provided by Parent to its similarly situated employees,
    as in effect from time to time; <I>provided </I>that employees
    covered by collective bargaining agreements need not be provided
    with such benefits. It is specifically provided that such
    employees of the Company who become employees of Parent will not

    participation in that plan has been limited to those employees
    of Parent who were participants of that plan as of
    December&#160;31, 2005 and who elected to remain in that plan.

    eligibility, vesting and level of benefits) thereunder (other
    than for purposes of benefits accrual under a defined benefit
    plan of Parent) the service of such employees with the Company
    as if such service were with Parent, to the same extent that
    such service was credited under a comparable plan of the
    Company, and, with respect to welfare benefit plans of Parent in
    which employees of the Company are eligible to participate,
    Parent agrees to waive any preexisting conditions, waiting
    periods and actively at work requirements under such plans. For
    purposes of each Parent health plan, Parent shall cause any
    eligible expenses incurred by employees of the Company and their
    covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the
    comparable plan of the Company ending on the date such
    employee&#146;s participation in the corresponding Parent plan
    begins to be taken into account under such Parent plan for
    purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
    out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his
    covered dependents for the applicable plan year of Parent plan.
    Parent agrees that employees of the Company as of the Effective
    Time who are terminated during the period commencing at the
    Effective Time and ending on the one-year anniversary thereof
    will be entitled to receive severance payments in accordance
    with the Company Bank&#146;s Employee Change of Control
    Severance Plan (the &#147;<I>Company Bank Severance
    Plan</I>&#148;) unless they have an agreement that otherwise
    provides for severance, in which case severance shall be

    employees of the Company as of the Effective Time who work less
    than 35&#160;hours per week and are not eligible to receive
    severance payments under the Company Bank Severance Plan who are
    terminated during the period commencing at the Effective Time

    Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as

    Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;), M&#038;T Bank Corporation
    (&#147;Parent&#148;) and MTB One, Inc. (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;).
    The Merger Agreement provides, <I>inter alia</I>, for the merger
    of the Merger Sub with and into the Company, with Company being
    the surviving entity (the &#147;Merger&#148;). Each share of the
    Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
    the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting
    Shares, will be converted into and constitute the right to
    receive, at the election of the holder thereof as provided in
    and subject to the provisions of Sections&#160;3.2 and 3.3 of
    the Merger Agreement, either (i)&#160;the Per Share Stock
    Consideration or (ii)&#160;the Per Share Cash Consideration.
    This Letter Agreement (this &#147;Letter Agreement&#148;) is
    being entered into pursuant to Section&#160;6.13 of the Merger
    Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have
    the meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

    I have been advised that (i)&#160;the Merger constitutes a

    thereunder, the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), and (ii)&#160;I may
    be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company, as the term

    Parent Common Stock that I may acquire in exchange for the

    accordance with the provisions of Rule&#160;145 under the
    Securities Act, pursuant to an effective registration statement
    under the Securities Act or in accordance with a legal opinion
    in form and substance satisfactory to Parent that such
