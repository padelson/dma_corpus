If the actual amount of any such item is not known as of the Closing Date, the
aforesaid proration shall be based on the previous year's assessment of such
item.

      2.3 Allocation. The aggregate Purchase Price for the Acquired Assets

any asset, the party making such increase or decrease agrees to file a
supplemental Form 8594 as required.

      2.4 Working Capital Adjustment.

accordance with this Section. Within thirty (30) business days after the Closing
Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer Seller's calculation of the
Closing Date Working Capital (the "Closing Date Working Capital Calculation"),
which shall have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and in accordance with
past practice. If the Closing Date Working Capital, as finally determined in
accordance with this Section 2.4, exceeds the Reference Working Capital, Buyer
shall pay Seller the difference; if the Closing Date Working Capital is less
than the Reference Working Capital, Seller shall pay Buyer the difference. In
either case, the adjustment provided in the preceding sentence shall be paid
within ten (10) days of the final determination of the Closing Date Working
Capital and shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

certified public accounting firm that shall be mutually agreed upon by such

practicable and that any determination of such accounting firm as to the
disputed matter shall be binding upon the parties hereto. In the event
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or any other accounting firm is employed to resolve
any dispute, the costs of any such accounting firm shall be divided equally

dispute, all amounts due hereunder shall be paid, in the manner set forth above,

                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER

      Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as follows:

validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Seller is duly qualified and/or licensed to transact business as a foreign
entity in the jurisdictions listed on Schedule 4.1 hereto and is in good

require it to be qualified or licensed in any other jurisdiction, except for
jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed will not have
a Material Adverse Effect.

      4.2 Authority and Status. The execution, delivery and performance by
Seller of this Agreement and each and every agreement, document and instrument
provided herein has been duly and validly authorized and approved by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Seller and no other corporate action
on the part of Seller is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, and each and every agreement, document and
instrument provided herein and therein. This Agreement and each agreement,
document and instrument provided for herein constitutes or will, when executed
and delivered, constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Seller,
enforceable against it in accordance with their respective terms, except as

moratorium, applicable equitable principles, or similar laws from time to time
in effect affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally.

      4.3 Capitalization. All the capital stock of Seller is owned of record in
the manner set forth on Schedule 4.3 hereto. There has been no change in the
ownership of the capital stock of Seller in contemplation of this Agreement.

      4.4 Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable. Schedule 4.4 sets forth a
list of all Accounts Receivable of Seller relating to the Business as of July
25, 2003 and the aging thereof, and all Accounts Payable of Seller as of July
25, 2003.

      All Accounts Receivable of Seller have arisen out of bona fide
transactions in the ordinary course of business and are carried at values
determined in accordance with GAAP consistently applied. All Accounts Receivable
reflect actual transactions and the granting of credit to customers in a manner
consistent with past practices of Seller, and, subject to the reserves or
allowances taken on a basis consistent with past practice, the Accounts
Receivable constitute valid and binding obligations of the obligors, makers,
comakers, guarantors, endorsers or debtors thereof. No agreement for deduction,
discount or setoff has been made with respect to any of such Accounts
Receivable, other than reserves and credits as reflected in the Working Capital.

      All Accounts Payable have arisen out of bona fide transactions in the
ordinary course of business, are consistent with Seller's past practices with
respect to its goods and services and are


                                       14
<PAGE>

Affiliates.

      4.5 Financial Statements. Attached hereto as Schedule 4.5 are true,
correct and complete copies of Seller's unaudited balance sheet and the related

Financial Statement Date") and the related statements of earnings and retained
earnings for the seven-month period then ended (collectively, the "Interim
Financial Statements", and together with the Unaudited Financial Statements, the
"Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements are complete and fairly
present the financial condition and results of operations of Seller as of the
dates and for the periods thereof and were prepared in accordance with GAAP,
consistently applied, and with a standard appropriate to Seller as a subsidiary
of a larger company, subject, in the case of Interim Financial Statements to
appropriate year-end adjustments.

      4.6 Taxes. Seller and any affiliated, combined or unitary group of which
Seller is or was a member (each, a "Tax Affiliate" and, collectively, the "Tax
Affiliates") has: (i) timely filed (or has had filed on its behalf) all Tax
Returns required to be filed by it by any taxing authority having jurisdiction
and the information provided in such Tax Returns is accurate and complete in all
material respects, and (ii) timely and properly paid (or has had paid on its
behalf) all Taxes shown to be due and payable on such Tax Returns. There are no

complete list and brief description of all of the real property owned by Seller

policies are to be procured. The Seller has delivered to Buyer correct and
complete copies of the leases and subleases listed on Schedule 4.7 (as amended
to date). Seller has good and marketable title to all of the Acquired Assets
owned or leased by Seller, including those listed and described in Schedule 4.7.
Upon satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 8.3, Seller has or will
have the right to transfer the Acquired Assets free and clear of all Liens,
except (i) as specifically disclosed or reserved against in the Financial
Statements or set forth on Schedule 4.7, (ii) for Liens for Taxes, fees, levies,
duties or other governmental charges affecting an Acquired Asset which are not
yet due and payable, to the extent the underlying amounts are included in the
Assumed Liabilities and reflected on the Financial Statements, (iii) Liens for
mechanics, material, laborers, employees, supplies or similar Liens arising by
operation of law for sums which are not yet due and payable, to the extent the
underlying amounts are included in the Assumed Liabilities and reflected on the
Financial Statements and (iv) easements, rights of way, covenants, restrictions,
leases, or other matters shown of record which affect an Acquired Asset which
are not material in amount, do not materially detract from the value or use of

dispute and no insurer under a Business Insurance Policy has asserted that any
material event or circumstance is


                                       21
<PAGE>

not a covered claim under such Business Insurance Policy. No coverage limits

<PAGE>

            6.2.1 Employment of the Employees. (a) As of the Closing Date,
Seller shall terminate, or cause to be terminated, the employment of the
Employees and Buyer agrees to offer to employ, effective as of the Closing Date,
each Employee of Seller listed on Schedule 4.22, (each Employee who accepts such
offer of employment by Buyer shall be referred to hereinafter as a "Transferred
Employee"). The terms and conditions of employment after the Closing Date of the
Transferred Employees shall be identical with respect to base salary and wages
and shall be substantially similar, in the aggregate for each Employee, with
respect to all other terms and conditions of their employment before the Closing
Date and at Buyer's sole cost. Buyer shall be responsible for and shall assume
all liability under the WARN Act or any similar state or foreign law which
arises as a result of Buyer not hiring Employees. No provision of this Agreement
shall confer upon any Employee any right with respect to continuance of
employment by Buyer, nor shall anything herein interfere with the right of
Seller to terminate the employment of any of the Transferred Employees at any
time prior to the Closing Date, with or without cause, or restrict Buyer in the
exercise of its independent business judgment in establishing or modifying any
of the terms and conditions of the employment of the Transferred Employees;
provided, however, that Seller and its Affiliates shall in no way be liable for
any Claims arising from Buyer's modification of any terms and conditions of the
employment of the Transferred Employees set forth in the second sentence of this
Section 6.2.1(a). Buyer shall be solely responsible for all the benefits and
compensation due to Transferred Employees on and after the Closing Date except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

            (b) Seller shall honor or cause its insurance carriers to honor all
Claims for benefits incurred by the Transferred Employees prior to the Closing
Date under the insurance programs provided to employees and maintained by Seller
in accordance with the terms of such insurance programs, without interruption as
a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            6.2.2 Pension and Welfare Benefits. (a) Seller shall provide COBRA
coverage to the Transferred Employees through September 30, 2003 and Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for standard COBRA premiums plus any costs or expenses incurred
by Seller for claims made by Transferred Employees during such coverage. No
later than October 1, 2003, Buyer, with respect to the Transferred Employees,
shall (i) cause a group health plan (including, without limitation, medical,
dental, prescription and the like) to enroll the Transferred Employees who were
enrolled in Seller's group health plan prior to the Closing Date and (ii) cause
such Buyer group health plan to waive any eligibility requirements, waiting
periods and pre-existing condition limitations to coverage and (iii) to the
extent any Transferred Employee has satisfied any internal limits, deductibles,
or co-payment requirements of any such group health plan of Seller, or has
amounts remaining in any health care spending or dependent care spending account
of Seller's, for the year that includes the Closing Date, cause such amounts to
be credited towards satisfaction of such requirements under Buyer's group health
plan or, in case of health care spending or dependent care spending accounts,
credited towards such accounts with Buyer. Buyer's group health plan shall
provide substantially comparable benefits and coverage in the aggregate to that
provided to such Transferred Employees under Seller's group health plan
immediately before the Closing Date. Seller shall satisfy all medical benefits
accrued through the Closing Date on account of employment with Seller by any
person employed by Seller immediately before the Closing Date, such that Seller
can terminate the COBRA coverage that it provides hereunder at the time the
Transferred Employees become covered under Buyer's group


                                       29
<PAGE>

health plan. Seller shall further, at its expense, comply with and provide the
benefits, if any, required under Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Title I
of ERISA ("COBRA") from and after the Closing Date for any person, other than a
Transferred Employee, who is or becomes entitled to COBRA continuation coverage
from Seller's group health plan or becomes entitled to such COBRA continuation
coverage as a result of, among other things, the termination of employment by
Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall, at its expense, comply with and
provide any benefits required under COBRA with respect to any Transferred
Employee who terminates employment with Buyer after the Closing Date.

            (b) Seller will take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions
necessary to terminate participation of the Transferred Employees in any
employee benefit plans of Seller as of the Closing Date. As of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall have in place employee benefit plans, policies and procedures
substantially similar to those that are available to the Transferred Employees
and their dependents as of the Closing Date under Seller's plans. Additionally,
Buyer agrees that it will cause any Buyer's plan that is a defined contribution
plan qualified under Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Code to accept direct
rollovers from Transferred Employees in the form of cash and outstanding
participant loans, if any, from the applicable plan of Seller. Buyer shall
provide credit to the Transferred Employees for all prior service with Seller
for any applicable waiting period, eligibility and vesting relating to any
defined contribution plan of Buyer. Buyer shall not provide credit for any
applicable waiting period, eligibility or vesting relating to any defined
benefit plan of Buyer.

            6.2.3 Employee Bonuses. For fiscal year 2003, Buyer will maintain
the bonus plan currently provided by Seller to the Employees with the exact same
terms and conditions. A copy of such plan and the Employee targets for fiscal
year 2003 are attached hereto as Schedule 6.2.3. Provided that Buyer maintains
and honors the bonus plan in accordance with the foregoing, Seller shall pay
Buyer an amount equal to the employee bonus obligations accruing on a per diem
basis for fiscal year 2003 through the Closing Date (the "Seller Bonus
Obligation"). Such payment shall not be made to Buyer until a payment is due to
the eligible employees under the terms of the bonus plan.

            10.3.1 Whenever a Claim shall arise for which any Person (an
"Indemnitee") shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article X,
Indemnitee shall notify the other party ("Indemnitor") in writing within 30 days
of the first receipt of notice of, or to the best of Indemnitee's knowledge of,
such Claim, and in any event within such shorter period as may be


                                       34
<PAGE>

necessary for Indemnitor to take the appropriate action to resist such Claim;
provided, however, that the failure of an Indemnitee to give timely notice shall
not affect its right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent that
Indemnitor is prejudiced by such failure (it being understood that this proviso
does not modify or otherwise affect the time periods specified in Section 10.6).
Such notice shall specify the nature of the Claim and the facts giving rise to
such indemnity rights with reasonable specificity, including the amount or
estimated amount of the Claim and the basis, in reasonable detail, for such
Claim.

            10.3.2 Upon receipt of any request for indemnification by Indemnitee
directly against Indemnitor (rather than indemnification for a Claim brought by
a third party), Indemnitor shall, within 30 days of receiving Indemnitee's
notice setting forth such request for indemnification, either (a) agree in
writing to such indemnification request, or (b) if Indemnitor believes in good
faith that it is not obligated to indemnify Indemnitee with respect to such
Claim, provide Indemnitee with oral notice of such disagreement, to be followed
promptly by written notice setting forth the basis for such objection in
reasonable detail. If Indemnitor fails to respond to Indemnitee's written
request within such 30-day period, Indemnitee's right to indemnification, as set
forth in Indemnitee's notice to Indemnitor, shall be deemed agreed to by
Indemnitor. If Indemnitor timely objects to Indemnitee's request for
indemnification, Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall meet and confer and attempt to
resolve such dispute through good faith negotiations.

      10.4 Third Party Claims.

            10.4.1 If any third party shall notify any Indemnitee of a Claim (a
"Third Party Claim") which may give rise to a right to indemnification against
any Indemnitor under this Article X, then the Indemnitee shall notify each
Indemnitor thereof in writing within 30 days; provided, however, that no delay
on the part of the Indemnitee in notifying any Indemnitor shall relieve the
Indemnitor from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent)
the Indemnitor thereby is prejudiced. Such notice shall specify the nature of
the Third Party Claim and the facts giving rise to such indemnity rights with
reasonable specificity, including the amount or estimated amount of the Third
Party Claim and the basis, in reasonable detail, for such Third Party Claim.

            10.4.2 An Indemnitor will have the right to defend the Indemnitee
against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnitee (and each Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate in connection
therewith and shall furnish such records, information and testimony and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be
reasonably requested by Indemnitor in connection therewith) so long as (i) the
Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee in writing within 15 days after the
Indemnitee has given notice of the Third Party Claim that the Indemnitor will,
to the extent required under this Article X (including taking into consideration
the limitations set forth in Section 10.6), indemnify Indemnitee from and
against Losses the Indemnitee may suffer as a result of the Third Party Claim,
(ii) the Indemnitor provides the Indemnitee with evidence reasonably acceptable
to the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor will have the financial resources to
defend against the Third Party Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations
hereunder, and (iii) the Indemnitor conducts the defense of the Third Party
Claim actively and diligently. If Indemnitor does not conduct the defense of a
Third Party Claim, Indemnitee may assume the defense thereof at the


                                       35
<PAGE>

expense of the Indemnitor and Indemnitor shall reasonably cooperate with such
defense; provided, however, that Indemnitor shall be responsible for the
reasonable fees and expenses of only one counsel (together with appropriate
local counsel) for all Indemnitees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Indemnitee
shall have the right to pay, settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without
the consent of Indemnitor if Indemnitee shall waive any right to indemnity
therefor. If Indemnitor assumes the defense of any Third Party Claim and later
relinquishes the defense for any reason, Indemnitor shall give prompt notice of
its intent to relinquish and shall reasonably cooperate in the transfer of the
defense.

            10.4.3 So long as the Indemnitor is conducting the defense of the
Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 10.4.2 above, (i) the Indemnitee
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in
the defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnitor will not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third
Party Claim, which judgment or settlement involves injunctive or other equitable
relief, without the prior written consent of Indemnitee, not to be withheld
unreasonably and (iii) the Indemnitee will not consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, not to be withheld
unreasonably.

            10.4.4 In the event any of the conditions in subsections 10.4.2(i)
through (iii) above is or becomes unsatisfied, however, (i) the Indemnitee may
defend against, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably
may deem appropriate (with the consent of Indemnitor, not to be unreasonably
withheld), (ii) the Indemnitor will reimburse the Indemnitee promptly for the
costs of defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses), and (iii) the Indemnitor will remain responsible
for any Losses the Indemnitee may suffer resulting from, arising out of,
relating to, or caused by the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided
in this Section 10.4.

      10.5 Reductions and Subrogations. If the amount of any Loss incurred by an
indemnified party at any time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment
is reduced by (i) any actual recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant
to any insurance coverage or (ii) any actual recovery, settlement or payment by
or against any other Person (each, a "Recovery"), the amount of such Recovery
(less any costs, expenses (including Taxes) or premiums incurred in connection
therewith), together with interest thereon from the date the indemnification
payment was made, shall promptly be repaid by the indemnified party to the
indemnifying party. Upon making a full indemnity payment, the indemnifying party
shall, to the extent of such indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of
the indemnified party against any third party in respect of the Loss to which
the indemnity payment relates.

      10.6 Limits on Indemnification Obligation. Notwithstanding anything in
Sections 10.1 or 10.2 to the contrary or in conflict:

            10.6.1 All of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, together
with the representations, warranties, agreements and covenants contained herein
or in any instrument or document delivered or to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, shall survive the execution of this Agreement and the Closing Date,
notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter


                                       36
<PAGE>

made by or on behalf of any party hereto; provided, however, that unless
otherwise stated, the agreements and covenants set forth in this Agreement shall
survive and continue until all obligations set forth therein shall have been
performed and satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) the representations
and warranties of Seller contained in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.26 of this
Agreement and the representations and warranties of Buyer contained in Sections
5.1, 5.2 and 5.4 of this Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue in
full force and effect indefinitely ("Type I Claims"); (b) the representations
and warranties of Seller contained in Section 4.6 of this Agreement shall
survive the Closing and continue in full force and effect until 90 days
following the expiration of any applicable statute of limitations (including any
extensions or waivers thereof) ("Type II Claims"); and (c) all other
representations and warranties ("Type III Claims"), and the agreements of Seller
and Buyer in Sections 10.1.1(i) and 10.2(i) to indemnify each other for breaches
of such representations and warranties, shall survive and continue for, and all
indemnification claims with respect thereto shall be made prior to, one year
from the Closing Date, except for representations, warranties and related
indemnities for which an indemnification claim shall be pending as of the end of
the applicable period referred to above, in which event such indemnities shall
survive with respect to such indemnification claim until the final disposition
thereof.

            10.6.2 Except on account of fraud or willful misconduct (for which
the Basket shall not apply), neither Seller, on the one hand, nor Buyer, on the
other hand, shall be liable for Type II or Type III Claims, as applicable, in
any instance until such time as the aggregate liability under such section
exceeds One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) (the "Basket"), in which
event Seller or Buyer, as is applicable, shall be liable for the full amount of
such liability.

            10.6.3 Except on account of fraud or willful misconduct, neither
Seller, on the one hand, nor Buyer, on the other hand, shall be liable for Type
II or Type III Claims, as applicable, for Losses which exceed, in the aggregate,
One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000). In no event shall the
aggregate liability of Seller, on the one hand, nor Buyer, on the other hand,
under the indemnity provisions of Section 10.1 and Section 10.2, as applicable,
exceed Fifteen Million Dollars ($15,000,000).

            10.6.4 Any term of this Article X to the contrary notwithstanding,
after the Closing Date, the rights and remedies of Buyer and Seller under this
Article X are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies
which Buyer and Seller may have with respect to the transactions evidenced
hereby.

      10.7 Conduct of Litigation. The parties agree to conduct any litigation
relating to this Article X in a reasonable manner and in good faith, including
appropriate concern for the best interests of each party hereto that is involved
in such litigation.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                KATY'S GUARANTEE

      11.1 Katy's Guarantee.


                                       37
<PAGE>

            11.1.1 Katy hereby unconditionally guarantees the due and punctual
payment and performance of the following obligations of Seller set forth in this
Agreement: (a) the indemnification obligations of Seller under Section 10.1 of
the Agreement, (b) the agreements and covenants of Seller set forth in Sections
2.4, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7 through 3.14, Article VI and Sections 12.2 and 12.4 of the
Agreement and (c) any liabilities relating to the Unassumed Liabilities.

            11.1.2 This guaranty is an irrevocable guaranty of payment (and not
just of collection) and shall continue in effect notwithstanding any extension
or modification of the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that any
assignment of any such guaranteed obligation to any other party, except in
accordance with Section 12.5 herein, shall operate as a discharge of Katy under
this Article XI. This guarantee is not conditioned upon any requirement that
Buyer first attempt to collect or enforce any guaranteed obligation from or
against Seller. Subject to Section 11.1.4, the obligations of Katy hereunder
shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by or contingent
upon any disability of Seller; provided, however, that such obligations shall be
subject to any defense Seller may have against Buyer.

            11.1.3 Katy hereby waives all demands and notices of every kind in
connection with this Article XI; provided, however, that nothing in this Article
XI shall limit or otherwise affect Buyer's notice and demand obligations under
Article X or any other limitations of Seller's indemnification obligations under
such Article. This Article XI shall continue to be effective or shall be
reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment or performance of any
obligation of Seller under this Agreement is rescinded or must otherwise be
restored or returned by Buyer upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization
of Seller or otherwise. Katy acknowledges that each of the waivers set forth
above is made with full knowledge of its significance and consequences and under
the circumstances the waivers are reasonable. If any of said waivers is
determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waivers
shall be effective only to the extent permitted by law.

            11.1.4 Article XI shall not be construed to expand the
indemnification obligations set forth in this Agreement. The aggregate liability
of Katy (under this Article XI) and Seller (under the terms of this Agreement)
shall not exceed $15,000,000. For purposes of clarification, and by way of
example, if Buyer shall be entitled to indemnification for a Loss of $15,000,000
under Article X and Buyer shall have received $2,000,000 from Seller, the
maximum aggregate potential liability of Katy shall be reduced to $13,000,000.

                                  ARTICLE XII
