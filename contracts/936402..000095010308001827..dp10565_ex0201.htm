The  Parties intend to combine their business operations by way of a
strategic  business combination ("Business Combination").  The Parties have
jointly considered various approaches and transaction  structures to effect
the Business Combination and have mutually agreed  that the most desirable
transaction structure having regard to the  interests of both the Company and
the Bidder and their respective  shareholders is an acquisition of the
Company by the Bidder through an  offer by Bidder to the shareholders of the
Company to purchase all  outstanding Company Shares against payment of a cash
consideration in Euro  ("Offer"). This  Business Combination Agreement sets
forth the  principal terms and the mutual understanding of the Parties with
respect  to the Business Combination, the transaction structure and the
future  organisational structure of the combined group.

Prior  to this Business Combination Agreement, the Major Shareholders

held by them. It is  acknowledged that upon completion of the Major
Shareholders SPAs, the  Bidder will acquire control of the Company within the
meaning of Section  35 Takeover Act.

members of the  Management Board or Supervisory Board will be deemed to be a
person acting  jointly with the Bidder pursuant to Section 2 para. 5 Takeover
Act (as  defined below) and, therefore, such Management Board or Supervisory
Board  Members from the date of this Business Combination Agreement, and

7.2.2

    |  

Following  Completion of the Offer, the Bidder and Company shall conduct a
review of  the assets and programs of the Company not directly or indirectly
related  to icatibant ("Non-Icatibant Assets"). This review will determine
first  whether, and if so, how the Non-Icatibant Assets are to be integrated
into  the Bidder's strategy and structure. For those Non-Icatibant Assets
deemed  strategic following the review, an appropriate support and
integration  plan will be determined. For those Non-Icatibant Assets deemed 
non-strategic, the Company will seek to divest, partner or otherwise deal 
with such assets. The Company will consider in good faith any reasonable, 
fair market offers, including any offers from the Management of the  Company
, to acquire, partner or otherwise deal with the non-strategic  Non-Icatibant
Assets, or any part of such assets. For purposes of clarity,  nothing in this
Business Combination Agreement shall obligate the Company  or the Bidder to
sell, dispose, partner or otherwise deal with the  strategic or non-strategic
Non-Icatibant Assets, or any part of them, with  the current Management of
the Company or any other third party and such  sale, disposal, partnering or
other dealing shall, at all times, be at the  sole discretion of the Company.

    
   

 

 

       

7.3

    |  

Following  Completion of the Offer, and in conjunction with the process of
Section  7.2.2, Bidder and Company shall determine a plan for each of the
Company\'s  employees. Employees will be treated fairly and informed of any
plans in a  timely manner. To the extent Non-Icatibant Assets are divested
or  partnered, Bidder and Company will make reasonable efforts to enable 
employees working with those Non-Icatibant Assets to transfer to the 
acquiring or partnering entity, while complying with all relevant 
legislation. To the extent that Non-Icatibant Assets are discontinued or  it
is not possible for employees to transfer as part of any divestment or 
partnership, the Company shall provide employees associated with those 
programs reasonable notice periods and severance agreements which shall 
provide for a severance of one (1) month salary for each year of  employment
of the respective employee with the Company, but at least an  amount equal to
the salary for six months.

possible to what the Parties, in the light of the intent and purpose of this
Business Combination Agreement, would have agreed upon if they had considered
the matter; or (ii) if any provision of this Business Combination Agreement
is invalid because of the scope of any time period or performance stipulated
herein; in this case a legally permissible time period or performance shall
be deemed to have been agreed which comes as close as possible to
the stipulated time period or performance.
