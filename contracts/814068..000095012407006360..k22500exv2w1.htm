asserting such right to indemnity (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give
the party from whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_
") written notice thereof, but any failure to so notify the Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to the
Indemnified Party other than to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its
option and expense, to participate in the defense of such proceeding or claim,
but not to control the defense, negotiation or settlement thereof, which
control shall at all times rest with the Indemnified Party, unless the
Indemnifying Party (i) admits in writing its liability to the Indemnified
Party hereunder with respect to such proceeding or claim; and (ii)
furnishes satisfactory evidence of its financial ability to indemnify the
Indemnified Party, in which case, the Indemnifying Party may assume such
control at its expense through counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party; _provided, however, that_ : 

   

 (a) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such claim; 

  

 (b) the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of such claim or ceasing to defend against such claim (with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld); 

  

 (c) no Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect of such claim; and the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or settlement of any claim to the extent the claim seeks an order, injunction, non-monetary or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party which, if successful, could materially interfere with the business, operations, assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Indemnified Party. 

 

8.5 Other Claims. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a
third-party claim shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party to the
Indemnifying Party in writing, setting forth specifically the obligation with
respect to which the claim is made, the facts giving rise to and the alleged
basis for such claim and, if known or reasonably ascertainable, the amount of
the liability asserted or which may be asserted by reason thereof, but any
failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified  ##### 

 

 

\- 48 -   

Party other than to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced
thereby. In the event the Indemnifying Party disputes its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party under this Article 8, the Indemnifying Party
shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of notice under this Section 8.5 to
give written notice of such objection, and the grounds therefor, and the
Indemnified Party shall thereafter have thirty (30) days to respond in
writing to the objection of the Indemnifying Party. If after such thirty (30)
day period there remains a dispute as to any obligation, the parties shall
attempt in good faith for thirty (30) days to agree upon the rights of the
respective parties with respect to such indemnification obligation. 

  

8.6 Survival. Subject to the time limitations of this Section 8.6, all
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations contained in this
Agreement and in any certificate, document, writing or instrument delivered
pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The representations
and warranties of each party contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date,
provided, however, that (i) the representations and warranties of Seller, the
Shareholder and the Principals set forth in Sections 3.1 (Organization), 3.4
(Authority and Enforceability) and 3.11 (Title) shall survive indefinitely,
and (ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.20
(Taxes), shall survive until 180 days after the running of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect to the taxable period to which the
particular claim relates. Any claim for indemnity under Sections 8.1(a) or
8.3(a) shall be asserted in writing within 90 days following the expiration
of the foregoing time periods, except for claims arising as a result of
fraud, willful breach or criminal liability, as to which the limitations of
this Section 8.6 shall not apply. Any other claim for indemnity under Article
8 shall be asserted in writing within 90 days after the running of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to the underlying liability
and the right of any of Buyers Indemnified Persons to indemnity for any such
other claim for indemnification under Article 8 shall not be limited or
affected by whether or not a breach of any representation or warranty has
occurred. The right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based
upon such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations shall not be
affected by any investigation (including any environmental investigation or
assessment) conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation.

 In no event shall the total liability of Seller, the Shareholder and the Principals for claims of Losses under Section 8.1 of this Agreement (other than relating to breaches of  ##### 

 

 

\- 49 -   

Sections 3.1, 3.4, 3.11, 3.20 and 3.35 of this Agreement) exceed in the

 (b) All recoveries for claims for Losses by Buyers Indemnified Persons under Article 8 shall be made first from the principal amount, including interest income, of the Escrow Fund. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the liability of either Principal exceed $5,000,000 individually, and the Principals shall not be liable in respect of any claim for indemnity asserted more than five (5) years after the Effective Time. 

 

8.8 Right of Setoff; Escrow. Upon notice to Seller specifying in reasonable
detail the basis therefor, Buyer may set off any amount up to a maximum of
$10,000,000 to which it may be entitled under this Article 8 against amounts
otherwise payable to Seller, the Shareholder or the Principals or may give
notice of a claim in such amount under the Escrow Agreement, provided that
Buyer shall not be entitled to make any set-off against the Note or amounts
payable pursuant to the Employment Agreement. Neither the exercise of nor the
failure to exercise such right of setoff or to give a notice of a claim under
the Escrow Agreement will constitute an election of remedies or limit
Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may be
available to it. 

   

ARTICLE 9 
 TERMINATION 

  

9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
Closing: 

   

 (a) by mutual consent of Buyer and Seller; 

  

 (b) by either Buyer or Seller if there has been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the other party set forth in this Agreement that has not been cured by the breaching party within ten days after the non-breaching party has notified the breaching party; 

  

 (c) by either Buyer or Seller at any time after February 29, 2008 (the " _Final Termination Date_ "), _provided that_ if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Final Termination Date as the result of a breach of this Agreement, then any party responsible for such breach may not avail itself of the right under this Section 9.1, and _provided further that_ in any such event, the non-breaching party(ies) shall not be deprived of any remedy hereunder or at law against the breaching party; 

  

 (d) by Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred on the Closing Date by reason of the failure of any of the conditions specified in Section 7.1 and such failure has not been waived by Buyer (unless the failure results primarily from the Buyer itself breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement); 

  

 (e) by Seller if the Closing shall not have occurred by the Closing Date by reason of the failure of any of the conditions specified in Section 7.2 and such failure has not been waived by Seller (unless the failure results primarily from Seller himself breaching any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement); or  ##### 

 

 

\- 50 -  

 (f) by either Buyer or Seller if a court of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in each case permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable. 

 

9.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement by
either Seller or Buyer, as provided above, this Agreement shall forthwith
terminate and there shall be no liability on the part of either Seller or
Buyer or Parent, or their respective officers or directors, except for
liabilities arising from a material breach by a party hereto of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement; provided, however, that the obligations of the parties set forth
in Sections 5.10 (Confidentiality) and 10.10 (Expenses) hereof shall survive
such termination. 

  

9.3 Not an Election. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 9, each
partys right of termination under Section 9.1 is in addition to any other
rights it may have under this Agreement or otherwise, and the exercise of
such right of termination will not be an election of remedies. 

  

9.4 Waiver of Conditions. No waiver by the Buyer or the Seller of the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2, in whole or in part, shall in
any way prejudice or limit the rights and remedies of the party waiving such
condition to claim or recover damages and compensation from the other party
in respect of any inaccuracy in any representation or warranty, nor in respect
of any breach or non-performance of any covenant, agreement or other
obligation of the other party contained in this Agreement, regardless of
whether or not such matter was the subject of such waiver. The parties may
not rely on the failure to satisfy any of the conditions precedent set out in
Sections 7.1 or 7.2 as a basis for non-compliance with their obligations under
this Agreement if such condition precedent would have been satisfied but for
a material default by the party for whose benefit the condition exists in
complying with its obligations hereunder.

to demand strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement.  #####
