RECITALS

 

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub and the Company have unanimously approved the acquisition of the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

 WHEREAS, in furtherance of such acquisition, the Acquisition Sub will make a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ " or the " _Shares_ "), at a price of $19.50 per Share, net to the sellers in cash, without interest thereon, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

 WHEREAS, to effectuate the acquisition of the Company, following consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Acquisition Sub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in such merger (the " _Merger_ ").

 

 WHEREAS, the current Board of Directors of the Company as of the date hereof (the " _Company Board_ ") has (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are fair to, and in the best interest of, the Company and its stockholders; (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "); (iii) declared the advisability of this Agreement; and (iv) resolved to recommend that the holders of the Shares tender their Shares in the Offer and adopt this Agreement.

 

 WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement and in furtherance of the transactions contemplated hereby, certain stockholders of the Company are entering into support agreements (the " _Support Agreements_ ") with the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub providing that such stockholders shall, among other things, tender their Shares in the Offer and otherwise support the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Support Agreements.

 

 WHEREAS, Buyer, Acquisition Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and to prescribe certain conditions to the Offer and the Merger.

 

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the Buyer, the Acquisition
Sub and the Company agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

1.1 _The Offer_.

 

 (a) _Commencement of the Offer; Acceptance of Shares_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable (and in any event within ten (10) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement, the Buyer shall cause the Acquisition Sub to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (and including the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) the Offer to purchase any and all outstanding Shares at a price of $19.50 per Share, net to the sellers in cash, without interest thereon (the " _Offer Consideration_ "). On the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of the Offer, the Acquisition Sub shall (and the Buyer shall cause the Acquisition Sub to) (i) accept for payment, at the earliest date permitted under applicable Law following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in _Annex I_ , all Shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer and (ii) pay for all such Shares promptly after acceptance. The obligation of the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn shall be subject only to the conditions set forth in _Annex I_ and to no other conditions.

 

 (b) _Expiration Date; Extensions and Amendments; Subsequent Offering_ _Period_. The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be the twentieth (20th) Business Day after commencement of the Offer (determined in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the Exchange Act) (such date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the " _Expiration_ _Date_ "). Without the prior written consent of the Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall not:

 

 (i) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the Offer Consideration or decrease the number of Shares sought to be acquired pursuant to the Offer; 

 

 (ii) extend or otherwise change the Expiration Date except (A) as required by applicable Law (including for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or the staff thereof), (B) that if, immediately prior to the scheduled Expiration Date (as it may be extended), any condition to the Offer has not been satisfied or waived, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall extend the Expiration Date for one or more periods (each in the reasonable judgment of the Buyer for the minimum period of time reasonably expected by the Buyer to be required to satisfy such conditions but in any event not in excess of twenty (20) Business Days each) but in no event beyond the 

  Outside Date, or (C) in connection with an increase in the consideration to be
paid pursuant to the Offer so as to comply with applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC;

 

 (iii) waive the Minimum Condition;

 

 (iv) amend or modify any term or condition of the Offer in any manner adverse to (or adversely affecting) holders of Shares; or 

 

 (v) impose any condition to the Offer not set forth in _Annex I_.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub may, without
the consent of the Company, and shall, if requested by the Company, elect to
provide a subsequent offering period for the Offer in accordance with Rule
14d-11 of the Exchange Act following their acceptance for payment of Shares in
the Offer.

 

 (c) _Schedule TO and Offer Documents_. On the date of commencement of the Offer, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall file with the SEC a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to_ _Purchase_ "), a form of the related letter of transmittal (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), and ancillary documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be made (collectively, together with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ ").

Subject to the requirements of applicable laws and except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall, until consummation of the Offer, hold in confidence the information contained in any of such labels and lists, and shall use such information only in connection with the communication of the Offer to the 

  Companys stockholders and the dissemination to the Companys stockholders of
any proxy or information statement relating to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement shall be
terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Buyer and the Acquisition
Sub shall, upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such information
then in their possession or under their control.

 

 (g) _Directors_.

 

 (i) _Election of Buyer Designees_. From and after the time the Acquisition Sub accepts Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ "), the Buyer shall be entitled to designate such number of members of the Company Board (the " _Buyer_ _Designees_ "), rounded up to the nearest whole number, as will give the Buyer representation on the Company Board equal to the product of the total number of members of the Company Board (after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub at such time (including Shares so accepted for payment) bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding; provided, that in no event shall Buyer have the right to designate any member of the Company Board unless and until Buyer has accepted for payment Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer representing a majority of the total outstanding voting power of the Company on a fully diluted basis (and therefore, at such time as the Buyer has the right to designate any Buyer Designees, the Buyer shall have the right to designate no less than a majority of the members of the Company Board). Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall take all actions necessary, including by increasing the size of the Company Board or securing the resignations of such number of the Companys incumbent directors, or both, to enable the Buyer Designees to be so elected or appointed to the Company Board and to cause the Buyer Designees to be so elected or appointed.

Subject to applicable Law, the Company shall promptly take all action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.1(g)(ii)_ and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to stockholders such information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this _Section 1.1(g)(ii)_. The Buyer will supply the Company any information with respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. Following the election or appointment of the Buyer Designees to the Company Board pursuant to this section, and until the Effective Time, the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to authorize: (A) any amendment to or termination of this Agreement on behalf of the Company; (B) any extension of time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub; (C) any waiver of compliance with any covenant or obligation of the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub or any condition to any obligation of the Company or any waiver of any right of the Company under this Agreement; and (D) any other action by the Company in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby required to be taken by the Company Board. " _Continuing Director_ " shall mean (1) any member of the Company Board, while such person is a member of the Company Board, who is not an Affiliate, representative or designee of the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub and who was a 

  member of the Company Board prior to the date of the Agreement, and (2) any
successor of a Continuing Director while such successor is a member of the
Company Board, who is not an Affiliate, representative or designee of the
Buyer or the Acquisition Sub and was recommended or elected to succeed such
Continuing Director by a majority of Continuing Directors.

On the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the Company will cause a certificate of merger in a form jointly prepared by the Buyer and the Company prior to the Closing (the " _Certificate of_ _Merger_ ") to be executed, acknowledged and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL (or to the extent provided in _Section 2.5_ , Section 253 of the DGCL).

 (b) _Closing of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at 12 noon, Eastern time, on a date to be specified by the Buyer and the Company (the " _Closing Date_ "), which shall be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than delivery of items to be delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain subject to the delivery of such items and the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing), at the offices of Bryan Cave LLP, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY, unless another date, place or time is agreed to in writing by the Buyer and the Company.

In addition, subject to _Section 6.6(b)_ , the Buyer shall cause the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to be amended and restated in their entirety so that, immediately following the Effective Time, they are identical to the bylaws of the Acquisition Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that all references to the name of the Acquisition Sub therein shall be changed to refer to the name of the Company, and, as so 

  amended and restated, such bylaws shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the DGCL.

 

 (d) _Directors of the Surviving Corporation_. The directors of the Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE II

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

 

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of the
capital stock of the Company or capital stock of the Acquisition Sub:

 

 (a) _Capital Stock of the Acquisition Sub_. Each share of the common stock of the Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation (" _Surviving Corporation Stock_ ").

 

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Buyer-Owned Stock_. All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and any shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Shares held on behalf of third parties) (" _Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer (other than the Acquisition Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares (or fractions thereof) of Surviving Corporation Stock that preserves the relative ownership interest represented by such share of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Merger.

 

 (c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.2_ , each share of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled or to be converted into Surviving Corporation Stock in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares (as defined in _Section 2.4(a)_ below)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $19.50 in cash per share or such greater amount as may have been paid to any holder of Shares pursuant to the Offer (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights 

  with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to this _Section 2.1(c)_ upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with _Section 2.2_ , without interest.

 

 (d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the
Merger are as follows:

 

 (a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer shall deposit with a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying_ _Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, for payment through the Paying Agent in accordance with this _Section 2.2_ , cash in an amount sufficient to make payment of the Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that are converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(c)_ (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Buyer; provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank which are then publicly available).

 

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be paid promptly in exchange therefor cash in an amount equal to the Merger Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such Certificate or Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a Person (as defined in this _Section 2.2(b)_ ) other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented to the Paying Agent, 

  accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.2_ , each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this
_Section 2.2_. As used in this Agreement, " _Person_ " means any individual,
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture,
association, trust, Governmental Entity, unincorporated organization or other
entity.

 

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, as directed by the Buyer, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not previously complied with this _Section 2.2_ shall be entitled to receive only from the Buyer payment of its claim for Merger Consideration, without interest.

 

 (e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or any rights under a Company Stock Plan such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or rights under a Company Stock Plan in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

 (g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall pay, in exchange for 

  such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be
paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby pursuant to this Agreement.

 

 (h) _Expenses_. The Buyer or the Acquisition Sub shall bear and pay all charges and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred in connection with the payment for the shares of Company Common Stock.

 

2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

 

 (a) _Cash-Out of Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (" _Company Stock Options_ ") whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall without any action on the part of the Company or the holder of such option, automatically be cancelled and exchanged for a cash payment by the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub or the Surviving Corporation (which shall be made promptly after the Effective Time) in an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration per share of Company Common Stock over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock for which such Company Stock Option is exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

 (b) _No Continuing Interest_. The parties agree that, following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Stock Option or any participant in any Company Stock Plan or other Company Employee Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company or under any Employment Agreement shall have any right thereunder to acquire any equity interest (including any "phantom" stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or the Surviving Corporation.

 

 (c) _Action by the Company_. With respect to each stock plan or other equity-related or equity-based plan of the Company or a Subsidiary, including, without limitation, any plan or arrangement which provides for Company Stock Options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, phantom stock, stock appreciation rights or stock purchase rights (each, a " _Company_ _Stock Plan_ "), as soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as are required to adjust the terms of the Company Stock Plans to permit the foregoing.

 

 (d) _Termination of Company ESPP_. The Company (i) modified the Option Care, Inc. 2001 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended (the " _Company ESPP_ "), so that the offering period beginning January 1, 2007 and scheduled to end December 31, 2007 shall instead end June 30, 2007 (the " _Final Offering Period_ "), contingent upon consummation of the Merger, and Shares will be purchased under the Company ESPP with respect to such Final Offering Period based on contributions made by participants through June 30, 2007, and (ii) amended the Company ESPP to terminate such plan, in accordance with its terms, immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares or Shares to be converted into Surviving Corporation Stock in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ ) that are held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who is entitled to demand and has properly exercised appraisal rights of such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (any such shares being referred to as " _Dissenting_ _Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares) shall not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1_ , but shall be entitled only to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL unless and until such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or loses its rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL.

 

 (b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into and shall represent only the right to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.1_ , without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such shares.

 

 (c) The Company shall give the Buyer: (i) prompt notice of any written demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relate to such demand; and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its written consent to such payment or settlement offer.

 

 2.5 _Short-Form Merger_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if, at any time after the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub, the Shares beneficially owned by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub, together with any Shares beneficially owned by the Buyers other Affiliates, shall collectively represent at least ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares, then the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable without a meeting of the Companys stockholders in accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL.

as now being conducted and is duly qualified to do business and, where

  whole may be considered in determining whether a Company Material Adverse
Effect has occurred;

 

 (h) any stockholder litigation arising from or relating to the Offer or the Merger;

 

 (i) any decline in the price of the Company Common Stock, provided that the underlying cause of the decline in the price of the Company Common Stock and its impact on the business, financial condition, assets, liabilities or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole may be considered in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred; 

 

 (j) any act of war, terrorism or armed conflict; or

 

 (k) any required repurchase or conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes as a result of (i) the transaction contemplated hereunder, or (ii) the satisfaction of the trading price condition, in each case pursuant to the indenture governing the Convertible Senior Notes;

confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 6.1(a)_ entered into in the
circumstances referred to in _Section 6.1(a)_ and except as otherwise
permitted by this _Section 6.1_ ); and (iii) the Company Board shall not,
except as set forth in this _Section 6.1_ , approve, endorse, adopt or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, if, prior to the Specified Time, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that such
action is reasonably necessary to comply with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Company Board may (x) withhold, withdraw or modify, or
propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the
Buyer or the Acquisition Sub, the Recommendation (a " _Change of
Recommendation_ ") and/or (y) if the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal which the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, after considering all of the adjustments to
the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by the Buyer including
pursuant to clause (ii) below, terminate this Agreement and enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (provided that in
the event of such a termination, the Company substantially concurrently enters
into such definitive agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the Company
shall not terminate this Agreement

  pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant
to the foregoing clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless,
concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ , and otherwise complies with the provisions of
_Section 8.1(g)_ , (B) the Company shall not have breached this _Section 6.01_
, and (C):

 

 (1) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to the Buyer, at least five Business days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with respect to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal); and

 

 (2) prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ , the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with the Buyer in good faith to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if the Buyer, in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments. In the event of any material revisions to a Superior Proposal (including, without limitation, any revision in price), the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to ensure that at least 2 Business Days remain in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies the Buyer of any such material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple extensions); and

 

 (3) the Buyer does not, within the Notice Period, make an offer that the Company Board determines in good faith to be as favorable to the Companys stockholders as such Superior Proposal.

 

 (c) _Notices to the Buyer_. The Company promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) shall advise the Buyer orally and in writing of (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) any request for information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to be related or lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) any inquiry or request for discussion or negotiation regarding or that would reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, including in each case the identity of the person making any such Acquisition Proposal or indication or inquiry or offer or request and the material terms and conditions of any such Acquisition Proposal or indication or inquiry or offer. The Company shall keep the Buyer reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis of the status (including any material changes to the terms thereof) of any such discussions or negotiations regarding any such Acquisition Proposal or indication or inquiry or offer or any material developments relating thereto (the Company agreeing that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing such information to the Buyer). The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend, release or modify any provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality or similar agreement to which it or one of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party and that the Company and its Subsidiaries shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement, except to the extent, after consultation with 

  outside counsel, the Company Board determines that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

 (d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to any tender offer contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to stockholders) or (ii) making any required disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with outside counsel, it is required to do so under applicable Law or the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall this _Section 6.1(d)_ affect the obligations of the Company specified in _Sections 6.1(b)_ or _(c)_ ; and _provided_ _,_ _further_ that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms its Recommendation (x) in such communication or (y) within 2 Business Days after requested to do so by the Buyer.

 

 (e) _Cessation of Ongoing Discussions_. The Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, cease immediately all discussions, solicitations or negotiations with any Person (other than the parties hereto) that commenced prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

 

 (f) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

 

 " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or group of Persons other than the Buyer or one of its Subsidiaries for a merger, reorganization, share exchange, joint venture, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, or similar transaction involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company the business of which constitutes twenty percent (20%) or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (ii) any proposal for the issuance by the Company of over twenty percent (20%) of its equity securities or (iii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, over twenty percent (20%) of the equity securities or consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Offer or the Merger.

 

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal on terms which (i) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to be more favorable to the holders of Shares from a financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger, taking into account all the terms and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Buyer in good faith to the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise) and (ii) that the Board of Directors (or Special Committee) believes is reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; provided, however, that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definitions of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent (50%)."

   6.2 _Company Stockholder Approval; Proxy Statement_.

 

  (a) _Company Stockholder Meeting_. If the adoption of this Agreement by
the stockholders of the Company is required under the DGCL in order to
consummate the Merger, the Company, in cooperation with the Buyer and acting
through the Company Board, shall, promptly following the Acceptance Date,
take all actions in accordance with applicable Law, its certificate of
incorporation and bylaws and the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market to promptly
and duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
(the " _Company_ _Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of considering and
voting upon the Company Voting Proposal. Subject to _Section 6.1_ , the
Company Board shall make the Recommendation and include the Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement. Subject to _Section 6.1_ , the Company shall take all
action that is both reasonable and lawful to solicit from its stockholders
proxies in favor of the Company Voting Proposal and shall take all other
action reasonably necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the
stockholders of the Company required by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market
or the DGCL to obtain such approvals.

 

  (b) _Proxy Statement_. If the adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company is required under the DGCL in order to consummate
the Merger, the Company, in cooperation with the Buyer, shall, promptly
following the Acceptance Date, prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy
Statement. The Company shall respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff
and shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the resolution of any such comments.
The Company shall notify the Buyer promptly upon the receipt of any comments
from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of any request
by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement and shall supply the Buyer with copies of
all correspondence between the Company or any of its representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any other government officials, on the
other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement. The Company shall cooperate
and provide the Buyer with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the draft of the Proxy Statement (including each amendment or supplement
thereto). The Company and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause all documents that the Company is responsible for filing with the SEC
or other regulatory authorities under this _Section 6.2_ to comply in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of law and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information should be discovered by any party hereto which should
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the
Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC and
disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of the Company.

 

  (c) _Voting of Shares_. The Buyer shall cause all shares of Company
Common Stock purchased by the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub pursuant to the
Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Buyer or the
Acquisition Sub to be voted in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. The

  cause their direct and indirect subsidiaries not to, sell, transfer, assign,
encumber or otherwise dispose of the Shares beneficially owned by the Buyer or
the Acquisition Sub as of the date of this Agreement or acquired pursuant to
the Offer or otherwise prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, if any is
required.

 

6.3 _Access to Information_. During the Interim Period, the Company shall (and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to the Buyers officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access,
upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours and in a manner that does
not unduly disrupt or interfere with business operations, to all of its
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records as the Buyer
shall reasonably request, and, during such period, the Company shall (and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Buyer (a) a
copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed
or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
or state securities laws and (b) all other information concerning its
business, properties, assets and personnel as the Buyer may reasonably
request. The Buyer will hold any such information which is nonpublic in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company shall not be required to permit any inspection or other
access, or to disclose any information or documents, that in the reasonable
good faith judgment of the Company would: (i) result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties; (ii) violate any obligation of the Company
with respect to confidentiality (including any documents and information
described in the Company Disclosure Letter whose disclosure is prohibited by
the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party in effect on the
date of this Agreement); (iii) jeopardize protections afforded the Company
under the attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product doctrine;
(iv) violate any legal requirement; or (v) unduly interfere with the conduct
of the Companys business. All information obtained by the Buyer and its
representatives pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ shall be treated as "Disclosure
Material" for purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

6.4 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, including _Section 6.1_ , _Section 6.4(b)_ , and _Section 6.4(c)_ , each of the Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable including: 

 

 (i) obtaining from any Governmental Entity or any other third party any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations, clearances, or orders required to be obtained or made by the Company, the Buyer or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including the Acquisition Sub) in connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby;

  (ii) making all necessary filings, and thereafter making any other required submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Merger required under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable federal or state securities laws; 

 

 (iii) filing within 10 Business Days following the date of this Agreement, a Notification and Report Form as required under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

 (iv) executing and delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

 

In connection with these duties, the Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition
Sub shall cooperate with each other, including by providing copies of all such
documents to outside counsel for the non-filing party prior to filing and, if
requested, accepting reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested in
connection therewith. The Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to the rules and regulations of any applicable law in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 (b) Subject to the terms hereof, the Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub agree, and shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries, to cooperate and to use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals required under the HSR Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub agree as follows:

 

 (i) to use their reasonable best efforts to achieve substantial compliance, as promptly as practicable, with any request for additional information and documentary material (" _Second Request_ ") issued by the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") or the Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ "), and to any other government requests for information under any federal or state law, regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions taken for the purpose or with the effect of monopolizing or restraining trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ ");

 

 (ii) to contest and resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an " _Antitrust Order_ ") that restricts, prevents or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Antitrust Law; 

 

 (iii) to consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and provide to outside counsel for the other parties in advance, any analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings under or relating to any Antitrust Law; and

  (iv) to keep counsel for the other party informed of any and all substantive communications with the DOJ, FTC or any other U.S. or state governmental entity (collectively, " _Antitrust Authorities_ ") that pertain to the review or approval of the Merger under any Antitrust Laws, and to allow the other party to participate, to the extent permissible under applicable laws and regulations, in any meetings with the Antitrust Authorities.

 

 (c) In addition to the foregoing, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub agree to propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of the Buyer or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or assets of the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Antitrust Order, which would have the effect of preventing or delaying the Effective Time beyond the Outside Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer shall take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (i) no requirement for a waiver, consent or approval of the Antitrust Authorities or other Governmental Entity, (ii) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (iii) no other matter relating to any Antitrust Law or regulation would preclude consummation of the Merger by the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall not be required to (and the Company shall not) become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of a Governmental Entity to sell, to divest, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change assets or businesses of the Company, the Buyer, or any of their subsidiaries if such actions would result in, or would be reasonably likely to result in, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect; provided that any requirement to sell, to divest, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change assets or businesses of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect for purposes of this _Section_ _6.4(c)_ if such action with respect to a comparable amount of assets or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries would be reasonably likely, in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 (d) Each of the Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall give (or shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and use, and cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any third-party consents.

 

6.5 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by applicable Law or stock
market regulations, (a) the press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be issued in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and the Buyer and (b) the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub and (except in
furtherance of actions permitted by _Section 6.1_ or as required by applicable
Law) the Company shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to

  consult with the other party before issuing any other press release or
otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement.

 

6.6 _Indemnification_.

 

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified_ _Parties_ "), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative, legislative or investigative (whether internal or external), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent not prohibited by law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of expenses incurred in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the Buyer and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a request therefor, provided that any such Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay such advancement if it is ultimately determined that the Indemnified Party is not entitled to be indemnified.

 

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and the Buyer will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to: (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party (a true, complete and accurate list of which is set forth in _Section 6.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter); and (ii) any indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter or organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement. From the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and Buyer shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries than are presently set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, and such provisions shall not be amended, repealed, or otherwise modified in any manner that could adversely affect the rights thereunder of any person benefited by such provisions. If, at any time prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer, as applicable, a written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this section, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and finally resolved.

 

 (c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i) maintain, and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from and after the Effective Time the current policies

  of the directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company
(the " _Current D andO_ _Insurance_ ") with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would
not be in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the last annual premium
paid prior to the Effective Time (such 300%, the " _Maximum Premium_ "), or
(ii) purchase a six (6)-year extended reporting period endorsement with
respect to the Current DandO Insurance (a " _Reporting Tail Endorsement_ ") and
maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full term. If the
Companys existing insurance expires, is terminated or cancelled during such
six-year period or exceeds the Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation
shall obtain, and Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as
much directors and officers liability insurance as can be obtained for the
remainder of such period for an annualized premium not in excess of the
Maximum Premium, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the
Indemnified Parties than the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Company may, with the Buyers prior written consent, prior to
the Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement, provided that the
Company does not pay more than six (6) times the Maximum Premium for such
Reporting Tail Endorsement, in which case, the Surviving Corporation shall,
and the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain such Reporting
Tail Endorsement in full force and effect for its full term, the Buyer shall
be relieved from its obligations under the preceding two sentences of this
_Section 6.6(c)_.

 

 (d) The Buyer shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this _Section 6.6_ in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided in this _Section 6.6_.

 

 (e) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise available to the current officers and directors of the Company by Law, charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

 

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. During the Interim Period, the Buyer
and the Acquisition Sub shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the
Company shall give prompt notice to the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub, of (a)
the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which occurrence or failure
to occur is reasonably likely to cause any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material
respect, in each case at any time from and after the date of this Agreement
until the Effective Time, or (b) any material failure of the Buyer and
Acquisition Sub or the Company, as the case may be, or of any officer,
director, employee or agent thereof, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this _Section 6.7_ will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys
obligation to consummate the Merger.

 

6.8 _Employee Benefits and Service Credit_.

 

 (a) For a period of twelve months following the Effective Time, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide the employees of 

   the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries who
shall have been employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ "), while
such Continuing Employees remain so employed, health welfare, pension and
retirement benefits that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, than either
(i) those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time, or (ii) those provided to similarly situated employees of
the Buyer and its Subsidiaries under the Buyer Employee Plans (as defined
below). Following the Effective Time, the Buyer will give each Continuing
Employee full credit for prior service with the Company or its Subsidiaries to
the extent such service would be recognized if it had been performed as an
employee of Buyer for purposes of (w) eligibility and vesting under any Buyer
Employee Plans, (x) unless covered under another arrangement with or of the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation, determination of benefit levels under any
Buyer Employee Plan or policy of general application relating to vacation or
severance, and (y) determination of "retiree" status under any Buyer Employee
Plan, in each case for which the Continuing Employees are otherwise
prospectively eligible and in which the Continuing Employees are offered
participation, but except where such credit would result in a duplication of
benefits. For the avoidance of doubt, no Continuing Employee shall be
retroactively eligible for any Buyer Employee Plan, including any such Buyer
Employee Plan that was frozen prior to the Effective Time. In addition, the
Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating
to pre-existing conditions to the same extent such limitations are waived
under any comparable medical and dental plan of the Buyer and recognize for
purposes of annual deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and
dental plans, deductible and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing
Employees in the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Buyer Employee Plan_ " means any
"employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA),
"employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), and
any other written or oral plan, agreement or arrangement, including insurance
coverage, severance benefits, disability benefits, deferred compensation,
bonuses and severance benefits (but excluding equity-based compensation plans
and any contract, offer letter or agreement of the Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries with or addressed to an individual), for the benefit of, or
relating to, the current employees of the Buyer or its Subsidiaries and with
respect to which eligibility has not been frozen.

 

  (b) Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring, and the
Company shall take no action that would have the effect of requiring, Buyer or
the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific employee benefit plans or
to continue the employment of any specific person. The provisions of this
_Section 6.8_ are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and
nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i)
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans
maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to or following the
Effective Time or (ii) confer upon or give to any person (including for the
avoidance of doubt any current or former employees, directors, or
independent contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or on or
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation or any of its
subsidiaries), other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns, any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies
(with respect to the matters provided for in this _Section 6.8_ ) under or by
reason of any provision of this Agreement.

  6.9 _Approval of Compensation Arrangements_. If the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into, adopts, amends, modifies or terminates any
Arrangements to Covered Securityholders, all such amounts payable under such
Arrangements shall (a) be paid or granted as compensation for past services
performed, future services to be performed, or future services to be refrained
from performing, by the Covered Securityholders (and matters incidental
thereto) and (b) shall not be calculated based on the number of Shares
tendered or to be tendered into the Offer by the applicable Covered
Securityholder. Moreover, the Company (acting through the Executive
Compensation Committee of the Company Board) shall take such steps as may be
required so that, prior to the Expiration Date: (i) the adoption, approval,
amendment or modification of each such Arrangement shall be approved as an
employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement
solely by independent directors of the Company in accordance with the
requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act and the instructions
thereto and (ii) the "safe harbor" provided pursuant to Rule 14d-10(d)(2) is
otherwise applicable thereto as a result of the taking prior to the Expiration
Date all necessary actions by the Company Board, the Executive Compensation
Committee of the Company Board or its independent directors.

 

6.10 _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Law shall become applicable to the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the
Company, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub and their respective Boards of
Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such Takeover Law.

 

6.11 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give the Buyer the
opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement,
in, but not control, the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation
against the Company or its directors or officers relating to the Offer, the
Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that
no such settlement shall be agreed to without the Buyers consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

6.12 _Alteration of Transaction Structure_. In the event that any Significant
Required Governmental Approval has not been obtained within 45 days after the
date hereof, or if in the parties reasonable good faith judgment any such
approval is not reasonably likely to be obtained within 75 days after the date
hereof, the Buyer shall be permitted to deliver a written notice to the
Company (the " _Transaction Alteration Notice_ ") electing to alter the
structure of the acquisition of the Company by the Buyer to provide for the
merger of the Acquisition Sub with and into the Company, with the Company
surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer (the " _One
Step Merger_ "). The One Step Merger shall be effected upon the terms set
forth in _Section 1.2_ and _Article II_ hereof. Following the delivery of the
Transaction Alteration Notice, the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub shall
terminate the Tender Offer and the parties hereto shall take all actions
necessary to call and hold a meeting of the Companys stockholders for
purposes of adopting this Agreement, as so modified pursuant to this _Section
6.12_ , as promptly as reasonable practicable, including, without limitation,
the filing by the Company of the Proxy Statement relating to such meeting with
the SEC. Subject to _Section 6.1_ , which shall remain in effect
notwithstanding the change in transaction structure (except that all
references to the Acceptance Time shall be deemed to refer to the effective
time of the Merger and all references

  to Acceptance Date shall be deemed to refer to the date on which the closing
of the One Step Merger shall occur), the Proxy Statement will contain the
Recommendation, as so modified to take into account the alteration in
transaction structure. The conditions to the parties obligations to complete
the One Step Merger shall be the same as those conditions applicable to the
Buyer and the Acquisition Subs conditions to accept Shares for payment in the
Tender Offer as set forth in _Annex I_ (except that the Minimum Condition
shall be replaced with a condition that this Agreement be adopted by the
Required Company Stockholder Vote, and the references in _Annex_ _I_ to the
Expiration Date and the Acceptance Time shall be deemed references to the
Effective Time of the merger), and the conditions to the parties obligations
to complete the Merger (other than _Section 7.1(b)_ , although, for the
avoidance of doubt, item 6 set forth in Annex 1 shall be a condition to the
completion of the One Step Merger).

 

ARTICLE VII

 

CONDITIONS TO MERGER

 

7.1 _Conditions to Each Party s Obligations to Effect the Merger_. The
respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall be subject to

Effective Time of only the following conditions:

 

 (a) _Stockholder Approval_. Unless the Merger is consummated pursuant to Section 253 of the DGCL, the Company Voting Proposal shall have been adopted at the Company Meeting by the Required Company Stockholder Vote.

 

 (b) _No Injunction_. No Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued or entered any restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or similar order or legal restraint or prohibition which remains in effect that enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Merger.

ARTICLE VIII

 

TERMINATION AND AMENDMENT

 

8.1 _Termination_. Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the Offer or the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (with respect to
_Sections 8.1(b)_ through _8.1(j)_ , by written notice by the terminating
party to the other party), whether before or after adoption of this Agreement
by the stockholders of the Company:

 

 (a) by mutual written consent of the Buyer and the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Time; 

  (b) by either the Buyer or the Company if the Acceptance Date shall not have occurred by the six month anniversary of the date of this Agreement (subject to possible adjustment as provided below, the " _Outside Date_ "), provided that: 

 

 (i) if the condition to the completion of the Offer set forth in item 2 of _Annex I_ has not been satisfied by the four month anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall be such four month anniversary, provided that if the Buyer delivers written notice to the Company on or prior to such four month anniversary that in the Buyers good faith judgment, it is reasonably probable that the condition set forth in such item 2 will be satisfied on or prior to the six month anniversary of this Agreement, the Outside Date shall be the six month anniversary of the date of this Agreement; and

 

 (ii) if the condition to the completion of the Offer set forth in item 1 of _Annex I_ shall not have been satisfied by the sixth month anniversary of the date of this Agreement, but all other conditions set forth on _Annex I_ would be satisfied if the Acceptance Date were to occur on such date, the Buyer shall be entitled to extend the Outside Date by up to three additional one-month periods by written notice to the Company if in the Buyers good faith judgment, it is reasonably probable that the condition set forth in such item 1 will be satisfied during such three month period; it being understood that in no event shall the Buyer be entitled to extend the Outside Date to a date that is later than the nine-month anniversary of this Agreement; 

 

provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party whose failure (or whose
subsidiarys failure) to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement resulted
in the failure of the milestones set forth in each of clauses (i) or (ii)
above to occur on or before the Outside Date, and provided further, that the
passage of such period shall be tolled for any part thereof during which any
party shall be subject to a non-final order, decree, ruling or action
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Offer;

 

 (c) by either the Buyer or the Company at any time prior to the Acceptance Date if a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any other nonappealable final action, in each case having the effect of permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Offer or the Merger, provided that the party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(c)_ shall have used such efforts as may be required by _Section 6.5_ to prevent, oppose or remove such injunction;

 

 (d) by the Company, if the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub shall have failed to commence the Offer within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement; provided that at such time, the Company has filed or is then prepared to file the Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC;

 

 (e) by the Buyer or the Company, if, due to the failure of one or more conditions set forth in _Annex I_ , the Offer shall have terminated or expired in accordance 

  with its terms without the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub having purchased any
Shares pursuant to the Offer (provided, however, that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ shall not be available to any
party whose failure (or whose Subsidiarys failure) to fulfill any of its
obligations under this Agreement results in the failure of any such condition
or if the failure of such condition results from facts or circumstances
involving any intentional misrepresentation or any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement under this Agreement by such
party or any of its Subsidiaries);

 

 (f) by the Buyer at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, if: (i) the Company Board shall have failed to recommend the Offer in the Schedule 14D-9 or shall have undertaken a Change of Recommendation; (ii) the Company Board shall have approved, endorsed or recommended to the stockholders of the Company an Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) in the case of an Acquisition Proposal made by means of a tender offer or exchange offer for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, the tender offer or exchange offer constituting the Acquisition Proposal shall have been commenced and the Company Board shall have recommended that the stockholders of the Company tender their shares in such tender or exchange offer or, within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such tender or exchange offer, the Company Board shall have failed to recommend against acceptance of such offer; 

 

 (g) by the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Date, in order to enter into a transaction that is a Superior Proposal in accordance with _Section 6.1(b)_ , and prior to or concurrently with such termination, the Company pays the fee due under _Section 8.3(b)_ ;

 

 (h) by the Buyer at any time prior to the Acceptance Date if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a failure of a condition set forth in section 3 or 4 of _Annex I_ or _Section_ _7.1_ to be satisfied and (ii) cannot be cured by the Outside Date, provided that the Buyer shall have given the Company written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination, stating the Buyers intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(h)_ and the basis for such termination; or

 

 (i) by the Company, if the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Annex I_ to be satisfied or the failure of the Acceptance Date or the Closing to occur and (B) cannot be cured by the Outside Date, provided that the Company shall have given the Buyer written notice, delivered at least thirty (30) days prior to such termination, stating the Companys intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(i)_ and the basis for such termination.

 

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in _Section 8.1_ , this Agreement shall immediately become void and
there shall be no liability or

   obligation on the part of the Company, the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub or
their respective officers, directors, stockholders or Affiliates; provided,
that (a) any such termination shall not relieve any party from liability for
any willful breach of this Agreement and (b) the provisions of _Sections 5.2_
(Confidentiality) and _8.3_ (Fees and Expenses), this _Section 8.2_ (Effect of
Termination) and _Article IX_ (Miscellaneous) of this Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive
any termination of this Agreement.

 

 8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 

  (a) Except as set forth in this _Section 8.3_ , and except for any HSR
filing fees, which shall be paid by the Buyer, all fees and expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and expenses, whether or not
the Merger is consummated.

 

  (b) The Company shall pay the Buyer a termination fee of $25,800,000
(the " _Termination Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_ ; (ii) by the Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_
, or (iii) either the Buyer or the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or
_Section 8.1(e)_ or by the Buyer pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ if, (A) before
the date of such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly
announced and not withdrawn and (B) within twelve (12) months after the date
of termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect
to, or consummates, a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal;
provided, however, that, for purposes of this _Section_ _8.3(b)_ , all
references (whether in words or numerals) to "twenty percent (20)%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"forty percent (40)%" (a " _Qualifying Transaction_ "). Any fee due under
_Section 8.3(b)(i)_ shall be paid to the Buyer prior to or concurrently with
the termination of this Agreement by the Company by wire transfer of same-day
funds. Any fee due under _Section 8.3(b)(ii)_ shall be paid to the Buyer by
wire transfer of same-day funds within two Business Days after the date of
termination of this Agreement. Any fee due under _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_ shall
be paid to the Buyer by wire transfer of same-day funds within two Business
Days after the earlier of the entering into of such definitive agreement or
the consummation of such transaction.

 

  (c) In the event that a proposal regarding a Qualifying Transaction
shall have been made known to the public or to the Company Board or shall have
been made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or any Person
shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or not conditional or
withdrawn) to make a proposal regarding a Qualifying Transaction that
reasonably appears to be bona fide and thereafter this Agreement is
terminated under any of the circumstances referred to in _Section 8.3(b)(iii)_
 (disregarding the requirements of (A) and (B) of such clause and except for
a termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or a termination by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ ) and no Termination Fee is yet payable in
respect thereof pursuant to such Section, then the Company shall pay to the
Buyer all of the Expenses (as hereinafter defined) of the Buyer and the
Acquisition Sub and thereafter if the Company becomes obligated to pay to the
Buyer the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ _8.3(b)(iii)_ such payment
obligation shall be reduced by the amount of Expenses previously actually paid
to the Buyer pursuant to this sentence. As used herein, " _Expenses_ " shall
mean all out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, consultants, financial advisors and
investment bankers of the Buyer and its

   Affiliates), incurred by the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub or on their
behalf in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation,
negotiation, execution and performance of this Agreement and all other
matters related to the Offer and the Merger; provided that such fees and
expenses shall not in any case exceed $5 million in the aggregate. In
circumstances in which Expenses are payable pursuant to this _Section 8.3(c)_
, such payment shall be made to the Buyer not later than two Business Days
after delivery to the Company of an itemization setting forth in reasonable
detail all Expenses (which itemization may be supplemented and updated from
time to time by the Buyer until the 45th day after the Buyer delivers such
notice of demand for payment), and all such payments shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be designated by the
Buyer.

 

  (d) In the event that the Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ then the Buyer shall pay to the Company all out-
of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, accountants, consultants, financial advisors and investment bankers
of the Company), incurred by the Company or on its behalf in connection with
or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and all other matters relating to the Offer and
the Merger; provided that such fees and expenses shall not in any case exceed
$5 million in the aggregate. In circumstances in which the above expenses are
payable, such payment shall be made to the Company not later than two Business
Days after delivery to the Buyer of an itemization setting forth in
reasonable detail all such expenses (which itemization may be supplemented and
updated from time to time by the Company until the 45th day after the Company
delivers such notice of demand for payment), and all such payments shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account to be
designated by the Company.

 

  (e) In the event that the Company or the Buyer shall fail to pay the
Termination Fee and/or Expenses or expenses payable to the Company required
pursuant to this _Section 8.3_ when due, such Termination Fee and/or Expenses
or expenses payable to the Company, as the case may be, shall accrue interest
for the period commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a rate
equal to the rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of
New York from time to time during such period, as such banks Prime Lending
Rate. In addition, if the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or
Expenses or the Buyer shall fail to pay expenses payable to the Company, as
the case may be, when due, the Company or the Buyer, as applicable, shall
also pay to the Buyer or the Company, as applicable, all of the Buyers or the
Company, as applicable, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) in connection with efforts to collect such Termination Fee
and/or Expenses or expenses payable to the Company, as the case may be. The
parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section 8.3_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement and
that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages
in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Buyer for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision. Payment of the fees and expenses
described in this _Section 8.3_ shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in
the event of a willful material breach of this Agreement described in _Section
8.2(a)_ , but otherwise shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the
parties in connection with any termination of this Agreement.

  8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 1.1(g)(ii)_ relating to
matters requiring approval by the Continuing Directors, this Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their
respective Boards of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the
matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of any
party, but, after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law
requires further approval by such stockholders without such further approval.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the parties hereto.

 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 1.1(g)(ii)_
relating to matters requiring approval by the Continuing Directors, at any
time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto, by action taken or
authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, may, to the extent legally
allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not
apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition, as the case may
be, other than that which is specified in the extension or waiver. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger service, telex, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly given unless and until it actually is received by the party for whom it is intended. Any party to this Agreement may change the address to which notices and other communications hereunder 

  are to be delivered by giving the other parties to this Agreement notice in
the manner herein set forth.

 

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and the parties hereto
specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior understandings, agreements or
representations to the extent not embodied in this Agreement. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing: (a) the Buyer and the Acquisition Sub
acknowledge that the Company has not made and is not making any representation
or warranty whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express
or implied, except as set forth in _Section 1.1_ and _Article III_ , and that
neither the Buyer nor the Acquisition Sub is relying or has relied on any
representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this
Agreement, express or implied, except those set forth in _Section 1.1_ and
_Article III_ ; and (b) the Company acknowledges that the Buyer and the
Acquisition Sub have not made and are not making any representations or
warranties whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express
or implied, except as set forth in _Section_ _1.1_ and _Article IV_ , and that
it is not relying and has not relied on any representations or warranties
whatsoever regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, express or implied,
except as set forth in _Section 1.1_ and _Article IV_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance
with its terms.

 

9.4 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 6.6_ (with
respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries),
this Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights
or remedies upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with
any Person or to otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto.

 

9.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer may designate,
by written notice to the Company, another Subsidiary of the Buyer to be a
constituent corporation in lieu of Acquisition Sub, whereupon all references
to Acquisition Sub shall be deemed references to such other Subsidiary, except
that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to
Acquisition Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation.

 

9.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the

  parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or
to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term.

 

9.7 _Counterparts and Signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile transmission.

 

9.8 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents, table of defined
terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be
the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and
no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. The words
"hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in
this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or other document
made or delivered pursuant thereto unless otherwise defined therein. Whenever
the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the
corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of
nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to
any federal, state, local or foreign statute or law shall be deemed also to
refer to all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, unless the context
requires otherwise. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation." No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

 

9.9 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this Agreement are
for convenience of the parties only and shall be given no substantive or
interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this Agreement is for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving
effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application
of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

  9.11 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 

9.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware or of any federal court sitting in
Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)
agrees that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding shall be heard
and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transaction contemplated by
this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make
service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the
party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the giving of
notices in _Section 9.2_. Nothing in this _Section 9.12_ , however, shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law.

 

9.13 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

 

9.14 _Disclosure Letter_. Sections of the Company Disclosure Letter shall each
be arranged in Sections corresponding to the numbered sections contained in
this Agreement, and the disclosure in any section of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall qualify (a) the corresponding section of this Agreement and (b)
the other sections of this Agreement, to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent on its face from a reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies

CONDITIONS OF THE OFFER

 

 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, the Acquisition Sub shall not be obligated to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, pay for, and (subject to any such rules or regulations) may, to the extent expressly permitted by this Agreement, delay the acceptance for payment of any tendered Shares if (i) there shall not have been validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer a number of Shares which represents more than one-half of the number of Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis (which shall mean, for purposes of this _Annex I_ , as of any time, the number of Shares then outstanding, together with all Shares then issuable pursuant to outstanding Company Stock Options and issuance upon conversion of the Convertible Senior Notes (the " _Minimum_ _Condition_ ") or (ii) at any time after the date of this Agreement and before the Acceptance Time, any of the following events shall occur and be continuing:

 

 (1) The waiting period under the HSR Act applicable to the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Offer shall not have expired or otherwise been terminated.

 

 (2) Any Significant Required Governmental Approval (as defined below) shall not have been obtained. " _Significant Required Governmental Approval_ " shall mean any approval or clearance (other than the approval or clearance set forth in _Section I_ of the Company Disclosure Letter) required to be obtained by the Buyer, the Acquisition Sub or the Company from any Governmental Entity in order to permit the acceptance for payment of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer or the ownership and operation of the Company by the Buyer; provided, however, that any such approval or clearance shall not be deemed to be a "Significant Required Governmental Approval" unless the acceptance for payment of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer or the ownership and operation of the Company by the Buyer without first obtaining such approval or clearance would have or would be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

 

 (3) (i) any of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in the first two sentences in _Section 3.1(a)_ , _Section 3.2_ , _Section 3.4(a)_ , the first sentence of _Section 3.4(d)_ and the first sentence of _Section 3.7_ shall not be true and correct in all respects (except, in the case of _Sections 3.2_ , for such inaccuracies as are _de_ _minimis_ in the aggregate), in each case at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time as though made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date); or (ii) any of the other representations and warranties of the Company set forth herein (without giving effect to any "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers set forth therein) shall not be true and correct in each case at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time as though made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true 

  and correct would not have, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 (4) The Company shall not have in all material respects performed all obligations and complied with all covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, and such failure to perform shall not have been cured prior to such time.

 

 (5) A Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have enacted issued or entered any restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or similar order or legal restraint or prohibition which remains in effect that enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

 

 (6) There shall have been enacted since the date of the Agreement, and there shall remain in effect, any Law that prohibits the acceptance for payment of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer or that prohibits the consummation of the Merger, and the violation of such Law that would occur if Shares were accepted for payment or if the Merger were consummated would have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect or Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 (7) There shall be pending before any court of competent jurisdiction any action commenced by a Governmental Entity against the Company or the Buyer or the Acquisition Sub that seeks to prohibit the acceptance for payment of Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer or to prohibit the consummation of the Merger that would have a Company Material Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 

 (8) The Agreement shall have been validly terminated in accordance with _Article_ _VIII_ of the Agreement.

 Section 2. (a) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Corporation), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that such person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.

 

Exhibit A-2 (b) The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, except that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such Court of Chancery or such other court shall deem proper.

 

 (c) To the extent that a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith.

 

 (d) Any indemnification under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 2. Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or (iii) by the stockholders.

 

 (e) Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by a director or officer in defending any civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of any undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he or she is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation pursuant to this Section 2. Such expense (including 

 

Exhibit A-3 attorneys fees) incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid upon
such terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems
appropriate.

 

 (f) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 2 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any by-law, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.

 

 (g) For purposes of this Section 2, any reference to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting or surviving corporation, any constituent corporation (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent corporation, or is a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section 2 with respect to the resulting or surviving corporation as he or she would have with respect to such constituent corporation if its separate existence had continued.

 

 (h) For purposes of this Section 2, any reference to "other enterprise" shall include employee benefit plans; any reference to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to any employee benefit plan; and any reference to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation which imposes duties on, or involves services by, such director, officer, employee or agent with respect to an employee benefit plan, its participants or beneficiaries; and a person who acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation" as referred to in this Section 2.

 

 (i) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Section 2 shall continue as to a person who ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such person.

 

 Section 3. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another 

 

Exhibit A-4  corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against
any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any
such capacity, or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not
the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him or her against such
liability under the provisions of Section 145 of the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware.
