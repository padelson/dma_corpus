AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

  



  

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (this " _Agreement_ ")
dated as of May 1, 2017, is by and between First Bancorp, a North Carolina
corporation (" _Buyer_ "), and ASB Bancorp, Inc., a North Carolina
corporation (" _ASBB_ "). Capitalized terms used in this Agreement but not
defined elsewhere herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in Section
10.1 hereof.

  



  

 _Recitals_

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Buyer and ASBB have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
shareholders for ASBB to merge with and into Buyer, with Buyer being the
surviving entity (the " _Merger_ ") pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and have unanimously approved the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby the issued and outstanding
shares of ASBB Common Stock will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration from Buyer;

  



  

WHEREAS, the board of directors of ASBB has recommended that ASBB's
shareholders approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(the " _ASBB Recommendation_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, as a material inducement and as additional consideration to Buyer to
enter into this Agreement, each of the directors and executive officers of
ASBB have entered into a voting agreement with Buyer dated as of the date
hereof (each a " _Support Agreement_ " and collectively, the " _Support
Agreements_ "), in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , pursuant to
which each such Person has agreed, among other things, to vote all shares of
ASBB Common Stock owned by such Person in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, the Merger is subject to the approvals of the shareholders of ASBB,
regulatory agencies, and the satisfaction of certain other
conditions described in this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer and ASBB desire to make certain representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
various conditions to the Merger.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



  

Article 1 
 TRANSACTIONS AND TERMS OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION

  



  

1.1 Merger.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
ASBB shall merge with and into Buyer in accordance with the North
Carolina Business Corporation Act (the " _NCBCA_ "), and Buyer shall be the
Surviving Corporation resulting from the Merger and shall continue to be
governed by the Laws of the State of North Carolina. The Merger shall be
consummated in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement.

  



  

1.2 Time and Place of Closing.

  



  

The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Closing_ ") will
take place at 11:00 A.M. Eastern Time on the date that the Effective Time
occurs, or at such other time as the Parties, acting through their authorized
officers, may mutually agree. The Closing shall be held at such location as
may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties and may be effected by electronic
or other transmission of signature pages, as mutually agreed upon.

  



    

 | 1| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

1.3 Effective Time.

  



  

The Merger shall be consummated by filing Articles of Merger reflecting the
Merger (the " _Articles of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of North
Carolina. The Merger shall become effective (the " _Effective Time_ ") when
the Articles of Merger have been accepted for filing by the Secretary of
State of North Carolina or at such later time as may be mutually agreed
upon by Buyer and ASBB and specified in the Articles of Merger. Subject to
the terms and conditions hereof, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in
writing by the authorized officers of each Party, the Parties shall use their
reasonable efforts to cause the Effective Time to occur within five business
days of the last of the following dates to occur: (i) the effective date
(including expiration of any applicable waiting period) of the last required
Consent of any Regulatory Authority having authority over and approving or
exempting the Merger, (ii) the date on which the shareholders of ASBB approve
this Agreement to the extent such approval is required by applicable Law, or
(iii) expiration of the period specified within Section 9.1(d).

  



  

1.4 Restructure of Transactions.

  



  

Buyer shall have the right to request a revision to the structure of the
Merger contemplated by this Agreement by merging ASBB directly with and
into a subsidiary of Buyer, provided, that no such revision to the structure
of the Merger (i) shall result in any changes in the amount or type of
consideration which the holders of shares of ASBB Common Stock or ASBB Options
are entitled to receive under this Agreement, (ii) would unreasonably impede
or delay consummation of the Merger, or (iii) imposes any less favorable terms
or conditions on ASBB or Bank. Buyer may request such revision by giving
written notice to ASBB in the manner provided in Section 10.8, which
notice shall be in the form of a proposed amendment to this Agreement or in
the form of an Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger and
Reorganization, and the addition of such other exhibits hereto as are
reasonably necessary or appropriate to effect such change.

  



  

1.5 Bank Merger.

  



  

Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, First Bank ("
_Buyer Bank_ "), a wholly owned subsidiary of Buyer, and Asheville Savings
Bank, S.S.B. (the " _Bank_ "), a wholly owned subsidiary of ASBB, shall enter
into the Bank Agreement of Merger, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
, with such changes thereto as Buyer and ASBB shall mutually agree,
pursuant to which Bank will merge with and into Buyer Bank (the " _Bank
Merger_ "). The Bank Merger shall not occur prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

1.6 Tax Treatment of the Merger.

  



  

It is intended by the Parties that the Merger constitute a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. The Parties hereby adopt
this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). The Parties agree to cooperate
and use their best efforts in order to qualify the transactions contemplated
herein as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the Code, to not
take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to fail
to so qualify, and to report the Merger for federal, state and any local
income Tax purposes in a manner consistent with such characterization.

TERMS OF MERGER

  



  

2.1 Articles of Incorporation.

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.2 Bylaws.

  



  

The bylaws of Buyer in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall

repealed.

  



  

2.3 Directors and Officers.

  



  

The directors of Buyer in office immediately prior to the Effective Time,
together with such additional Persons as may thereafter be elected, shall
serve as the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time in accordance with the Surviving Corporation's bylaws, until
the earlier of their resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be a
director. Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall take all action necessary
to appoint Suzanne S. DeFerie and one additional representative of ASBB's
board of directors, as identified by Buyer, to the board of directors of
Buyer and Buyer Bank, to be effective as of 12:01 a.m. on the next
business day following the Effective Time. The officers of Buyer in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with such
additional persons as may thereafter be appointed, shall serve as the

resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer.

  



  

Article 3

  

MANNER OF CONVERTING SHARES

  



  

3.1 Effect on ASBB Common Stock.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, in each case subject to Sections 3.1(d) and
3.2, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Parties, each share of ASBB Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the Extinguished Shares)
shall be converted into the right to receive one of the following: (i) cash in
the amount of $41.90 (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), less any applicable
withholding Taxes; (ii) a number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio (the " _Stock Consideration_ "); or (iii) a combination of the Cash
Consideration and Stock Consideration (the " _Mixed Consideration_ ") in
such proportions as requested by the holder of such share of ASBB Common
Stock to the extent available after the proration of the total Merger
Consideration to 10% Cash Consideration and 90% Stock Consideration in
accordance with Section 3.2 of this Agreement (items (i), (ii), or (iii) are
referred to herein individually as the " _Per Share Purchase Price_ " and
collectively as the " _Merger Consideration_ "); _provided, however,_ and
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the maximum number of shares
of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in exchange for shares of ASBB Common Stock
shall be equal to 19.9% of the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (the " _Maximum Stock
Consideration_ "), and to the extent the total Stock Consideration would
otherwise exceed the Maximum Stock Consideration, the proration of the total
Merger Consideration between Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration shall
be appropriately adjusted. The "Exchange Ratio" shall be 1.44 shares of Buyer
Common Stock per share of ASBB Common Stock.

  



  

(b) At the Effective Time, all shares of ASBB Common Stock shall no
longer be outstanding, shall automatically be cancelled and retired, and
shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate previously
representing any such shares of ASBB Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ")
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share Purchase
Price.

  



    

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of ASBB
Common Stock, or ASBB Options, or the outstanding shares of Buyer
Common Stock, or any rights with respect to Buyer Common Stock pursuant to
stock options granted by Buyer (the " _Buyer Options_ ") are increased,
decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares
or securities, in each case as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock
split, or other similar change in capitalization, then an appropriate and
proportionate adjustment shall be made to the Per Share Purchase Price. For
the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall have the right to grant additional stock
options or other equity based awards under its existing equity
based compensation plans (" _Buyer Awards_ "), and holders of ASBB Options
shall have the right to exercise ASBB Options outstanding as of the date of
this Agreement without triggering an adjustment to the Per Share Purchase
Price under this Section 3.1(c).

  



  

(d) Each share of ASBB Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and owned by any of the Parties or
their respective Subsidiaries (in each case other than shares of ASBB Common
Stock held on behalf of third parties or as a result of debts previously
contracted) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled and retired
without payment of any consideration therefor, and cease to exist (the "
_Extinguished Shares_ ").

  



  

3.2 Election and Proration Procedures.

  



  

(a) An election form in such form as Buyer and ASBB shall agree (an "
_Election Form_ ") shall be mailed on the Mailing Date (as defined below) to
each holder of record of ASBB Common Stock. Unless another date is agreed to
by Buyer and ASBB prior to the Effective Time, the "Mailing Date" shall be
the date on which the Proxy Statement/Prospectus is first mailed to holders
of ASBB Common Stock. Buyer shall make available Election Forms as may be
reasonably requested by all Persons who become holders of ASBB Common Stock
after the record date for availability to vote at the ASBB Shareholders'
Meeting and prior to the Election Deadline (as defined herein), and ASBB
shall provide to Computershare Limited or such other exchange agent
selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to ASBB (the " _Exchange Agent_
") all information reasonably necessary for it to perform its obligations as
specified herein.

  



  

(b) Each Election Form shall entitle the holder of ASBB Common Stock (or
the beneficial owner through appropriate and customary documentation and
instructions) to elect to receive (i) the Stock Consideration for all of such
holder's shares (a " _Stock Election_ "), (ii) the Cash Consideration for all
of such holder's shares (a " _Cash Election_ "), (iii) the Mixed
Consideration for all of such holder's shares (a " _Mixed Election_ "), or
(iv) make no election (a " _Non-Election_ "). Holders of record of ASBB
Common Stock who hold such shares as nominees, trustees or in other
representative capacity (a " _Holder Representative_ ") may submit multiple
Election Forms, _provided, that_ such Holder Representative certifies
that each such Election Form covers all of the shares of ASBB Common Stock
held by that Holder Representative for a particular beneficial owner. The
shares of ASBB Common Stock as to which a Stock Election has been made
(including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are referred to herein as " _Stock
Election Shares_ ," and the aggregate number thereof is referred to herein as
the " _Stock Election Number_." The shares of ASBB Common Stock as to which
a Cash Election has been made (including pursuant to a Mixed Election) are
referred to herein as " _Cash Election Shares_ " and the aggregate number
thereof is referred to as the " _Cash Election Number_ ". Shares of ASBB
Common Stock as to which no election has been made (or as to which an
Election Form is not properly completed or returned in a timely fashion) are
referred to as " _Non-Election Shares_."

  



    

 | 4| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) To be effective, a properly completed Election Form must be received
by the Exchange Agent on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, on such date as the
Parties may mutually agree (the " _Election Deadline_ "), which shall in no
event be later than five calendar days following the Effective Time. An
election shall have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall
have actually received a properly completed Election Form by the Election
Deadline. An Election Form shall be deemed properly completed only if
accompanied by one or more Certificates representing all shares of ASBB Common
Stock covered by such Election Form, or the guaranteed delivery of such
Certificates (or customary affidavits and, if required by Buyer,
indemnification regarding the loss, mutilation, theft or destruction of such
Certificates), together with duly completed transmittal materials. For the
holders of Non-Election Shares, subject to Section 3.2(e), Buyer shall have
the authority to determine the type of consideration constituting the Per
Share Purchase Price to be exchanged for the Non-Election Shares. Any ASBB
shareholder may at any time prior to, but not after, the Election Deadline
change his, her or its election by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a properly completed and
signed revised Election Form. Any ASBB shareholder may, at any time prior to
the Election Deadline, revoke his, her or its election by written notice
received by the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by
withdrawal prior to the Election Deadline of his, her or its Certificates, or
of the guarantee of delivery of such Certificates. All elections shall be
revoked automatically if the Exchange Agent is notified in writing by either
Party that this Agreement has been terminated prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the applicable Section of Article 9 of this Agreement. If an ASBB
shareholder either (i) does not submit a properly completed Election Form by
the Election Deadline or (ii) revokes an Election Form prior to the Election
Deadline but does not submit a new properly executed Election Form prior to
the Election Deadline, the shares of ASBB Common Stock held by such
shareholder shall be designated as Non-Election Shares. Subject to the terms
of this Agreement and the Election Form, the Exchange Agent shall have
reasonable discretion to determine whether any election, revocation or change
has been properly made and to disregard immaterial defects in any Election
Form, and any good-faith decisions of the Exchange Agent regarding such
matters shall be binding and conclusive.

  



  

(d) The number of shares of ASBB Common Stock to be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration shall be equal to 10% of the number
of shares of ASBB Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Aggregate Cash Limit_ "), and the number of shares of ASBB
Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration
shall be equal to 90% of the number of shares of ASBB Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Aggregate Stock
Limit_ "); _provided, however_ , that the maximum number of shares of Buyer
Common Stock to be exchanged for shares of ASBB Common Stock shall not exceed
the Maximum Stock Consideration, and to the extent the total Stock
Consideration would otherwise exceed the Maximum Stock Consideration the
Aggregate Cash Limit and the Aggregate Stock Limit shall be
appropriately adjusted.

  



  

(e) Within five business days after the later to occur of the Election
Deadline or the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Exchange Agent to
effect the allocation among holders of ASBB Common Stock of the Merger
Consideration and to distribute such as follows:

  



  

(i) if the Stock Election Number exceeds the Aggregate Stock Limit,
then all Cash Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, and each Stock Election
Share shall be converted into the right to receive (A) the Stock
Consideration in respect of that number of Stock Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Stock Election Shares held
by such holder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Aggregate
Stock Limit and the denominator of which is the Stock Election Number, and
(B) the Cash Consideration for those Stock Election Shares which were not
converted into the right to receive Stock Consideration as a result of the
Stock Election Number exceeding the Aggregate Stock Limit;

  



  

(ii) if the Cash Election Number exceeds the Aggregate Cash Limit,
then all Stock Election Shares and all Non-Election Shares shall be converted
into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and each Cash Election
Share shall be converted into the right to receive (A) the Cash Consideration
in respect of that number of Cash Election Shares equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Cash Election Shares held by such
holder by (2) a fraction, the numerator of which is the Aggregate Cash
Limit and the denominator of which is the Cash Election Number, and (B) the
Stock Consideration for those Cash Election Shares which were not converted
into the right to receive Cash Consideration as a result of the Cash Election
Number exceeding the Aggregate Cash Limit; and

  



    

 | 5| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(iii) if the Stock Election Number and the Cash Election Number do not
exceed the Aggregate Stock Limit and the Aggregate Cash Limit,
respectively, then (A) all Cash Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive the Cash Consideration, (B) all Stock Election Shares shall
be converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration, and (C) all
Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and/or the Stock Consideration such that the aggregate number of
shares of ASBB Common Stock entitled to receive the Cash Consideration is
equal to the Aggregate Cash Limit and the aggregate number of shares of
ASBB Common Stock entitled to receive the Stock Consideration is equal to the
Aggregate Stock Limit.

  



  

3.3 Exchange Procedures.

  



  

(a) Promptly after the Effective Time, Buyer shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this Section 3.3, the
Merger Consideration and cash in an aggregate amount sufficient for payment
in lieu of fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock to which holders of ASBB
Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.7 (collectively, the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the cash in the Exchange Fund is
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made by the
Exchange Agent hereunder (including pursuant to Section 3.7), Buyer shall
promptly make available to the Exchange Agent the amounts so required to
satisfy such payment obligations in full. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Buyer
Common Stock out of the Exchange Fund. Except as contemplated by this Section
3.3, the Exchange Fund will not be used for any other purpose.

  



  

(b) Unless different timing is agreed to by Buyer and ASBB, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event no more
than seven business days after the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail to the former shareholders of ASBB appropriate
transmittal materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or other instruments
theretofore representing shares of ASBB Common Stock shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such Certificates or other instruments to the Exchange
Agent). In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of ASBB
Common Stock represented by one or more Certificates that are not registered
in the transfer records of ASBB, the Per Share Purchase Price payable for
such shares as provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 may be issued to a transferee
if the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares are delivered to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence such
transfer and by evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Exchange Agent that
such transfer is proper and that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. In the event any Certificate representing ASBB Common Stock shall
have been lost, mutilated, stolen, or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen, mutilated, or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in
such amount as Buyer may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, mutilated, stolen, or
destroyed Certificate the Per Share Purchase Price as provided for in
Sections 3.1 and 3.2. The Exchange Agent may establish such other
reasonable and customary rules and procedures in connection with its duties
as it may deem appropriate. Buyer shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent in connection with the
distribution of the Per Share Purchase Price as provided in Sections 3.1 and
3.2. Buyer or the Exchange Agent will maintain a book entry list of Buyer
Common Stock to which each former holder of ASBB Common Stock is entitled.
Certificates evidencing Buyer Common Stock into which ASBB Common Stock has
been converted will not be issued.

  



  

(c) Unless different timing is agreed to by Buyer and ASBB, after the
Effective Time, each holder of shares of ASBB Common Stock (other
than Extinguished Shares) issued and outstanding at the Effective Time shall
surrender the Certificate or Certificates representing such shares to the
Exchange Agent and shall promptly upon surrender thereof receive in exchange
therefor the consideration provided in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, without
interest, pursuant to this Section 3.3. The Certificate or Certificates of
ASBB Common Stock so surrendered shall be duly endorsed as the Exchange Agent
may reasonably require. Buyer shall not be obligated to deliver the
consideration to which any former holder of ASBB Common Stock is entitled as
a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders such holder's Certificate
or Certificates for exchange as provided in this Section 3.3. Similarly, no
dividends or other distributions in respect of the Buyer Common Stock shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Certificates until
such Certificate or Certificates (or affidavit in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 3.3(b)) are surrendered for exchange as provided in this Section 3.3.
Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither any Buyer
Entity, nor any ASBB Entity, nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any
holder of ASBB Common Stock for any amounts paid or properly delivered in good
faith to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat, or similar Law.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Each of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of ASBB
Common Stock and ASBB Options such amounts, if any, as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code
or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax Law or by any Taxing
Authority or Governmental Authority. To the extent that any amounts are so
withheld by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of ASBB Common
Stock, as applicable in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be.

  



  

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration and cash delivered to the
Exchange Agent by Buyer pursuant to Section 3.3(a) that remains unclaimed by
the holder of shares of ASBB Common Stock for six months after the Effective
Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered
by the Exchange Agent to Buyer. Any holder of shares of ASBB Common Stock who
has not theretofore complied with Section 3.3(c) shall thereafter look only
to Buyer for the consideration deliverable in respect of each share of ASBB
Common Stock such holder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement
without any interest thereon. If outstanding Certificates for shares of ASBB
Common Stock are not surrendered or the payment for them is not claimed prior
to the date on which such Merger Consideration would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Authority, the unclaimed items shall,
to the extent permitted by abandoned property and any other applicable law,
become the property of Buyer (and to the extent not in its possession
shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled to such property. Neither the Exchange Agent nor
any Party to this Agreement shall be liable to any holder of stock represented
by any Certificate for any consideration paid to a Governmental Authority
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Buyer and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of
ASBB to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the
consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of
stock represented by any Certificate or Certificates, Buyer and the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented thereby in
escrow with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with
respect to any claims thereto.

  



  

(f) Adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of ASBB shall
constitute ratification of the appointment of the Exchange Agent. 

  



  

3.4 Effect on Buyer Common Stock.

  



  

At and after the Effective Time, each share of Buyer Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued
and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall
not be affected by the Merger.

  



  

3.5 ASBB Options; ASBB Restricted Stock.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, each Right with respect to ASBB Common Stock
pursuant to stock options granted by ASBB under ASBB's 2012 Equity Incentive
Plan (the " _ASBB Options_ ") which is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled in exchange for the right to
receive a single lump sum cash payment, equal to the product of (i) the
number of shares of ASBB Common Stock subject to such ASBB Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Cash
Consideration over the exercise price per share of such ASBB Option, less any
applicable Taxes require to be withheld with respect to such payment. If the
exercise price per share of any such ASBB Option is equal to or greater than
the Cash Consideration, such ASBB Option shall be cancelled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof. Subject to the foregoing, ASBB's 2012
Equity Incentive Plan and all ASBB Options issued thereunder shall terminate
at the Effective Time.

  



    

 | 7| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) At the Effective Time, any time-based or other restrictions imposed
on shares of ASBB Common Stock granted by ASBB under ASBB's 2012 Equity
Incentive Plan (the " _ASBB Restricted Stock_ ") that is issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, lapse and shall be converted automatically into and shall
thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration, less any
income or employment tax withholding required under the Code or any
provision of applicable Law, in accordance with this Article 3. For the
avoidance of doubt, like other holders of ASBB Common Stock, holders of ASBB
Restricted Stock shall be entitled, pursuant to the terms and subject to the
conditions and limitations of Section 3.2, to make an election with respect
to the Merger Consideration that each will receive.

  



  

(c) Neither ASBB's board of directors nor its compensation committee
shall make any grants of ASBB Options or ASBB Restricted Stock following the
execution of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) ASBB's board of directors or its compensation committee shall make
any adjustments or amendments to or make such determinations with respect to
the ASBB Options and ASBB Restricted Stock necessary to effect the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.5.

  



  

3.6 Rights of Former ASBB Shareholders.

  



  

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of ASBB shall be closed as to
holders of ASBB Common Stock and no transfer of ASBB Common Stock by
any holder of such shares shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.3,
each Certificate theretofore representing shares of ASBB Common Stock (other
than Certificates representing Extinguished Shares), shall from and after the
Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Per
Share Purchase Price, without interest, as provided in this Article 3.

  



  

3.7 Fractional Shares.

  



  

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of ASBB Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger, who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common
Stock (after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder),
shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to
such fractional part of a share of Buyer Common Stock multiplied by the
Average Buyer Stock Price. No such holder will be entitled to dividends,
voting rights, or any other Rights as a shareholder in respect of any
fractional shares.

for the payment of any Tax on any Assets owned by any Buyer Entity or any
ASBB Entity being reassessed or revalued by any Regulatory Authority).

  



  

(c) Except for (i) the filing of applications and notices with, and

the FDIC, and the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, (ii) the filing of
any other required applications, filings, or notices with any other federal

4.3 Capital Stock.

  



  

(a) The authorized capital stock of ASBB consists of 60,000,000 shares
of ASBB Common Stock, of which 3,788,025 shares are issued and outstanding as
of the date of this Agreement, and assuming that all of the issued and
outstanding ASBB Options had been exercised, not more than an additional
443,900 shares would be issued and outstanding at the Effective Time, and
10,000,000 shares of ASBB preferred stock, of which no shares are issued and
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. If the ASBB Options were
exercised as of the date of this Agreement, 443,900 shares of ASBB Common
Stock would be issued at a per share weighted average exercise price of
$16.04. Section 4.3(a) of the ASBB Disclosure Memorandum lists all issued and
outstanding ASBB Options, which schedule includes the names of the
recipients, the date of grant, the exercise prices, the vesting schedules, and
the expiration dates, to the extent applicable. All of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of ASBB are duly and validly issued and
outstanding and are fully paid and nonassessable. None of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of ASBB has been issued in violation of any
preemptive rights of the current or past shareholders of ASBB.

  



  

(b) Except for the 443,900 shares of ASBB Common Stock reserved for
issuance pursuant to outstanding ASBB Options as disclosed in Section 4.3(a)
of ASBB Disclosure Memorandum, there are no shares of capital stock or other
equity securities of ASBB reserved for issuance and no outstanding Rights
relating to the capital stock of ASBB.

  



  

(c) Except as specifically set forth in this Section 4.3, there are no
shares of ASBB capital stock or other equity securities of ASBB
outstanding, and there are no outstanding Rights with respect to any ASBB
securities or any right or privilege (whether pre-emptive or
contractual) capable of becoming a Contract or Right for the purchase,
subscription, exchange, or issuance of any securities of ASBB.

  



  

4.4 ASBB Subsidiaries.

  



  

ASBB has no Subsidiaries except as set forth in Section 4.4 of the ASBB
Disclosure Memorandum, and ASBB owns all of the equity interests in each of
its Subsidiaries. No capital stock (or other equity interest) of any such
Subsidiary is or may become required to be issued (other than to another ASBB
Entity) by reason of any Rights, and there are no Contracts by which any such
Subsidiary is bound to issue (other than to another ASBB Entity) additional
shares of its capital stock (or other equity interests) or Rights or by which
any ASBB Entity is or may be bound to transfer any shares of the capital
stock (or other equity interests) of any such Subsidiary (other than to
another ASBB Entity). There are no Contracts relating to the Rights of any
ASBB Entity to vote or to dispose of any shares of the capital stock (or
other equity interests) of any such Subsidiary. All of the shares of capital
stock (or other equity interests) of each Subsidiary are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by ASBB free and clear of
any Lien. Each Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to transact business
as a foreign entity in good standing in the states of the United States and
foreign jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the nature or
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed. The
minute books and other organizational documents for the Subsidiaries have been
made available to Buyer for its review, and except as disclosed in Section
4.4 of the ASBB Disclosure Memorandum, are true and complete in all
material respects as in effect as of the date of this Agreement and
accurately reflect in all material respects all amendments thereto and all
proceedings of the board of directors and shareholders thereof.

4.5 Exchange Act Filings; Securities Offerings; Financial Statements.

  



  

(a) ASBB has timely filed all Exchange Act Documents required to be
filed by ASBB since January 1, 2013 (the " _ASBB Exchange Act Reports_ ").
ASBB Exchange Act Reports (i) at the time filed, (or, if amended or superseded
by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such
filing) complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Laws and other applicable Laws and (ii) did not, at the time
they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date
of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated in such ASBB Exchange Act Reports or necessary in order to make the
statements in such ASBB Exchange Act Reports, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. Each offering or sale of
securities by ASBB (x) was either registered under the Securities Act or made
pursuant to a valid exemption from registration under the Securities Act, (y)
complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Laws and other applicable Laws, except for immaterial "blue sky"
filings, including disclosure and broker/dealer registration requirements,
and (z) was made pursuant to offering documents which did not, at the time of
the offering (or, in the case of registration statements, at the effective
date thereof) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated in the offering documents or necessary
in order to make the statements in such documents, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. ASBB's principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have made the
certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and
the rules and regulations of the Exchange Act thereunder with respect to ASBB
Exchange Act Reports to the extent such rules or regulations applied at the
time of the filing. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "principal
executive officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings
given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Such certifications contain no
qualifications or exceptions to the matters certified therein and have not
been modified or withdrawn; and neither ASBB nor any of its officers has
received notice from any Regulatory Authority questioning or challenging the
accuracy, completeness, content, form, or manner of filing or submission of
such certifications. No ASBB Subsidiary is required to file any Exchange Act
Documents.

  



  

(b) Each of the ASBB Financial Statements (including, in each case, any
related notes) that are contained in ASBB Exchange Act Reports, including any
ASBB Exchange Act Reports filed after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, complied, or will comply, as to form in all material respects
with the Exchange Act, was, or will be, prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may
be indicated in the notes to such financial statements or, in the case
of unaudited interim statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the Exchange
Act), fairly presented in accordance with GAAP the consolidated financial
position of ASBB and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods indicated,
including the fair values of the assets and liabilities shown therein, except
that the unaudited interim financial statements were or are subject to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments which were not or are not expected to be
material in amount or effect, and were certified to the extent required by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



  

(c) ASBB's independent registered public accountants, which have
expressed their opinion with respect to the ASBB Financial Statements and its
Subsidiaries whether or not included in ASBB's Exchange Act Reports (including
the related notes), are and have been throughout the periods covered by such
ASBB Financial Statements (i) a registered public accounting firm (as defined
in Section 2(a)(12) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) (to the extent applicable
during such period), (ii) "independent" with respect to ASBB within the
meaning of Regulation S-X, and (iii) with respect to ASBB, in compliance with
subsections (g) through (l) of Section 10A of the Exchange Act and related
Securities Laws. ASBB's independent public accountants have audited
ASBB's year-end financial statements, and have reviewed ASBB's interim
financial statements, that are included in the ASBB Financial Statements.
Section 4.5(c) of the ASBB Disclosure Memorandum lists all non-audit services
performed by ASBB's independent registered public accountants for ASBB or
Bank.

  



  

(d) ASBB maintains disclosure controls and procedures as required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and such controls
and procedures are effective to ensure that all material information relating
to ASBB and its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to ASBB's
principal executive officer and ASBB's principal financial officer.

  



    

 | 11| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.6 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.

  



  

Neither ASBB nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability
or obligation of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent, determined, determinable, or otherwise and whether due or to
become due), except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the consolidated balance sheet of ASBB included in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (including
any notes thereto), (ii) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business consistent in nature and amount with past practice since December
31, 2016, or (iii) liabilities incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby. Neither ASBB nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any
joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract or
arrangement (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among ASBB and any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement"), where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, ASBB or any of its
Subsidiaries in ASBB's or such Subsidiary's financial statements.

  



  

4.7 Absence of Certain Changes or Events.

  



  

Except as disclosed in the ASBB Financial Statements delivered prior to the
date of this Agreement or as disclosed in Section 4.7 of the ASBB
Disclosure Memorandum, since December 31, 2016, (i) there have been no
events, changes, or occurrences which have had, or are reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a ASBB Material Adverse Effect, (ii)
none of the ASBB Entities has taken any action, or failed to take any action,
prior to the date of this Agreement, which action or failure, if taken after
the date of this Agreement, would represent or result in a material breach or
violation of any covenants and agreements of ASBB provided in this Agreement,
and (iii) since December 31, 2016, ASBB Entities have conducted their
respective businesses in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice.

  



  

4.8 Tax Matters.

  



  

Except as set forth in Section 4.8 of the ASBB Disclosure Memorandum:

  



  

(a) All ASBB Entities have timely filed with the appropriate Taxing
Authorities all material Tax Returns in all jurisdictions in which Tax
Returns are required to be filed, and such Tax Returns are correct and
complete in all material respects. None of the ASBB Entities is the
beneficiary of any extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. All
material Taxes of the ASBB Entities to the extent due and payable (whether or
not shown on any Tax Return) have been fully and timely paid. There are no
Liens for any material Taxes (other than a Lien for current tax year real
property or _ad valorem_ Taxes not yet due and payable) on any of the Assets
of any of the ASBB Entities. No written claim has ever been made by any Taxing
Authority in a jurisdiction where any ASBB Entity does not file a Tax Return
that such ASBB Entity may be subject to Taxes by that jurisdiction.

  



  

(b) None of the ASBB Entities has received any written notice of
assessment or proposed assessment in connection with any Taxes. There are no
ongoing or pending disputes, claims, audits, or examinations regarding any
Taxes of any ASBB Entity, any Tax Returns of any ASBB Entity, or the assets
of any ASBB Entity. No officer or employee responsible for Tax matters of any
ASBB Entity expects any Taxing Authority to assess any additional material
Taxes for any period for which Tax Returns have been filed. No issue has
been raised by a Taxing Authority in any prior examination of any ASBB
Entity, which, by application of the same or similar principles, could be
expected to result in a proposed material deficiency for any subsequent
taxable period. None of the ASBB Entities has waived any statute of
limitations in respect of any Taxes or agreed to a Tax assessment or
deficiency.

  



    

 | 12| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Each ASBB Entity has complied in all material respects with all
applicable Laws relating to the withholding of Taxes and the payment thereof
to appropriate authorities, including, but not limited to, Taxes required to
have been withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any
employee or independent contractor, and Taxes required to be withheld and paid
pursuant to Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code or similar provisions under
foreign Tax Law.

  



  

(d) The unpaid Taxes of each ASBB Entity (i) did not, as of the most
recent fiscal month end, materially exceed the reserve for Tax
Liability (rather than any reserve for deferred Taxes established to reflect
timing differences between book and Tax income) set forth on the face of the

for any Employee Benefit Plan for the current plan year and the three
preceding plan years, (v) the most recent summary plan description for each
ASBB Benefit Plan and any material modifications thereto, and (vi) all
material correspondence from or to the IRS, DOL, or PBGC regarding any ASBB
Benefit Plan received or sent during this calendar year or any of the
preceding three calendar years.

  



  

(c) Each ASBB Benefit Plan is in material compliance with the terms of
such ASBB Benefit Plan, in compliance with the applicable requirements of the
Code, in compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA, and in
compliance with any other applicable Laws. Each ASBB ERISA Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter or opinion from the IRS or, in the
alternative, appropriately relies upon a favorable determination letter issued
to a prototype plan under which the ASBB ERISA Plan has been adopted and ASBB
is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any
such favorable determination letter. ASBB has not received any written
communication from any Governmental Authority questioning or challenging the
compliance of any ASBB Benefit Plan with applicable Laws. No ASBB Benefit Plan
is currently being audited by any Governmental Authority for compliance with
applicable Laws or has been audited with a determination by any Governmental
Authority that the Employee Benefit Plan failed to comply with applicable
Laws.

  



  

(d) There has been no material oral or written representation or
communication with respect to any aspect of the Employee Benefit Plans
made to employees of any ASBB Entity which is not in all material respects in
accordance with the written or otherwise preexisting terms and provisions of
such plans. Neither ASBB, any ASBB Entity, nor, to the Knowledge of ASBB, any
administrator or fiduciary of any ASBB Benefit Plan (or any agent of any of
the foregoing) has engaged in any transaction, or acted or failed to act in
any manner, which could subject ASBB, any ASBB Entity, or Buyer to any direct
or indirect Liability (by indemnity or otherwise) for breach of any
fiduciary, co-fiduciary, or other duty under ERISA. There are no unresolved
claims or disputes under the terms of, or in connection with, ASBB Benefit
Plans other than claims for benefits which are payable in the ordinary course
of business consistent with the terms of the applicable plan, and no action,
proceeding, prosecution, inquiry, hearing, or investigation has been
commenced with respect to any ASBB Benefit Plan other than routine claims for
benefits.

  



  

(e) All ASBB Benefit Plan documents and annual reports or returns,
audited or unaudited financial statements, actuarial valuations,
summary annual reports, and summary plan descriptions issued with respect to
the ASBB Benefit Plans are correct and complete in all material respects, to
the extent applicable, have been timely filed with the IRS, the DOL, or PBGC,
and distributed to participants of the ASBB Benefit Plans (as required by
Law), and there have been no material misstatements or omissions in the
information set forth therein.

(f) To the Knowledge of ASBB, no "party in interest" (as defined in
ERISA Section 3(14)) or "disqualified person" (as defined in Code Section
4975(e)(2)) of any ASBB Benefit Plan has engaged in any nonexempt "prohibited
transaction" (as described in Code Section 4975(c) or ERISA Section 406).

  



  

(g) No ASBB Entity nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has, or ever has had,
any obligation or Liability in connection with, a ASBB Pension Plan, or any
plan that is or was subject to Code Section 412, ERISA Section 302 or Title IV
of ERISA, or any multiemployer plan (as defined in Sections 4001(a)(3) or
3(37) of ERISA).

  



  

(h) No material Liability under Title IV of ERISA has been or is
expected to be incurred by any ASBB Entity or any ERISA Affiliate
thereof, and no event has occurred that could reasonably result in Liability
under Title IV of ERISA being incurred by any ASBB Entity or any ERISA
Affiliate thereof with respect to any ongoing, frozen, terminated, or other
single-employer plan of any ASBB Entity or the single-employer plan of any
ERISA Affiliate. Except as may arise in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, there has been no "reportable event," within
the meaning of ERISA Section 4043, for which the 30-day reporting
requirement has not been waived by any ongoing, frozen, terminated or other
single employer plan of ASBB or of an ERISA Affiliate.

  



  

(i) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(i) of the ASBB Disclosure
Memorandum, or required under Part 6 of ERISA or Code Section 4980B or
similar state law, no ASBB Entity has any material Liability or obligation
for retiree or post-termination of employment or services health or life
benefits under any of the ASBB Benefit Plans, or other plan or arrangement,
and there are no restrictions on the Rights of such ASBB Entity to
unilaterally amend or terminate any and all such retiree or post-termination
of employment or services health or benefit plan without incurring any
Liability or obtaining any consent or waiver. No Tax under Code Sections 4980B
or 5000 has been incurred with respect to any ASBB Benefit Plan or other plan
or arrangement, and to the Knowledge of ASBB, no circumstance exists that
could give rise to such Taxes.

  



  

(j) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(j) of the ASBB Disclosure
Memorandum, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (whether alone or in
connection with any other event) will (i) result in any payment (including
severance, unemployment compensation, "excess parachute payment" as defined
under Code Section 280G, or otherwise) becoming due from any ASBB Entity
under any ASBB Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits
otherwise payable under any ASBB Benefit Plan, or (iii) result in any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefit, or any
benefit under any life insurance owned by any ASBB Entity or the Rights of any
ASBB Entity in, to or under any insurance on the life of any current or
former officer, director, or employee of any ASBB Entity, or change any Rights
or obligations of any ASBB Entity with respect to such insurance.

  



  

(k) Section 4.15(k) of the ASBB Disclosure Memorandum sets forth
preliminary calculations, based on assumptions set forth therein, of the
following: (i) the amount of all payments and benefits to which each
individual set forth on such ASBB Disclosure Memorandum is entitled
to receive, pursuant to all employment, salary continuation, bonus, change in
control, and all other agreements, plans and arrangements, in connection with
a termination of employment before or following, or otherwise in connection
with or contingent upon, the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
(for the avoidance of doubt, excluding payments or benefits in respect of
vested equity awards) (each such total amount in respect of each such
individual, the " _Change in Control Benefit_ "), other than the payment any
such individual shall otherwise be entitled to receive as a gross-up payment
in respect of any excise tax imposed on the individual pursuant to Section
4999 of the Code as calculated pursuant to the applicable agreement (any each
such payment, a " _Gross-Up Payment_ "); (ii) the amount of any Gross-Up
Payment payable to each such individual; and (iii) the aggregate amount of
all Change in Control Benefits and Gross-Up Payments.

(l) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(l) of the ASBB Disclosure
Memorandum, no ASBB Benefit Plan is or has been funded by, associated
with, or related to a "voluntary employee's beneficiary association" within
the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code, a "welfare benefit fund" within
the meaning of Section 419 of the Code, a "qualified asset account" within
the meaning of Section 419A of the Code or a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. The actuarial
present values of all accrued deferred compensation entitlements (including
entitlements under any executive compensation, supplemental retirement, or
employment agreement) of employees and former employees of any ASBB
Entity and their respective beneficiaries, other than entitlements accrued
pursuant to funded retirement plans, whether or not subject to the provisions
of Code Section 412 or ERISA Section 302, have been reflected on the ASBB
Financial Statements in all material respects to the extent required by and
in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(m) Each ASBB Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code) has been operated in
compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance issued by the IRS
with respect to such plans or is not required to comply therewith due to its
grandfathered status under Section 409A of the Code.

  



  

(n) All individuals who render services to any ASBB Entity and who are
authorized to participate in an ASBB Benefit Plan pursuant to the terms of
such ASBB Benefit Plan are in fact eligible to and authorized to participate
in such ASBB Benefit Plan. All ASBB Entities have, for purposes of the ASBB
Benefit Plans and all other purposes, correctly classified all individuals
performing services for such ASBB Entity as common law employees, independent
contractors, or agents, as applicable.

  



  

(o) Neither ASBB nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has had an "obligation
to contribute" (as defined in ERISA Section 4212) to, or other obligations or
Liability in connection with, a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in ERISA
Sections 4001(a)(3) or 3(37)(A)) or any employee pension benefit plan within
the meaning of ERISA Section 3(2) that is subject to Section 412 of the Code
or Section 302 of ERISA or a multiple employer plan within the meaning of
Section 413(c) of the Code or ERISA Sections 4063, 4064, or 4066.

  



  

(p) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(p) of the ASBB Disclosure
Memorandum, there are no payments or changes in terms due to any
insured person as a result of this Agreement, the Merger or the transactions
contemplated herein, under any bank-owned, corporate-owned split dollar life
insurance, other life insurance, or similar arrangement or Contract, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, upon and after the Effective Time, succeed to
and have all the rights in, to and under such life insurance Contracts as ASBB
presently holds. Each ASBB Entity will, upon the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, and will continue to have until the Effective Time,
notwithstanding this Agreement or the consummation of the transaction
contemplated hereby, all ownership rights and interest in all corporate or
bank-owned life insurance.

  



  

(q) Each ASBB ERISA Plan that is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code so qualifies, and its related trust is tax exempt under
Section 501(a) of the Code, and no event has occurred and no condition exists
that could cause the loss of such qualified or tax exempt status.

  



  

(r) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(r) of the ASBB Disclosure
Memorandum, with respect to each ASBB Pension Plan, (i) all
contributions required to be made under Sections 412 and 430 of the Code with
respect to such ASBB Pension Plan have been made timely, (ii) there has been
no application for any waiver of the minimum funding standards imposed by
Section 412 of the Code, and such minimum funding standards have been met to
date, and (iii) there is not any "amount of unfunded benefit liabilities" as
defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA under such ASBB Pension Plan.

  



  

(s) Each ASBB Benefit Plan may be amended or terminated by ASBB without
the consent of any Person.

  



  

(t) Except as disclosed in Section 4.15(t) of the ASBB Disclosure
Memorandum, no ASBB Benefit Plan that is described in ERISA Section 3(2) is
involved or connected with any fund or other investment that has or involves
any early termination, market value adjustment or other similar fee, payment
requirement, or other charge.

circumstance that is reasonably likely to materially impede or delay receipt
of any required Consents or result in the imposition of a condition or
restriction of the type referred to in the last sentence of Section 8.1(b). No

Article 7

  

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

  



  

7.1 Shareholder Approval.

  



  

(a) ASBB shall submit to its shareholders this Agreement and any other
matters required to be approved by shareholders in order to carry out the
intentions of this Agreement. In furtherance of that obligation, ASBB shall
take, in accordance with applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and
bylaws, all action necessary to call, give notice of, convene, and hold ASBB's
Shareholders' Meeting as promptly as reasonably practicable for the purpose
of considering and voting on approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
transactions provided for in this Agreement. ASBB's board of directors shall
recommend that its shareholders approve this Agreement in accordance with the
NCBCA and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
delivered to shareholders of ASBB, except to the extent ASBB's board of
directors has made an Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined below) in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. ASBB shall solicit and use its
reasonable efforts to obtain the Requisite ASBB Shareholder Approval.

  



  

(b) Neither ASBB's board of directors nor any committee thereof shall,
except as expressly permitted by this Section 7.1, (i) withdraw, qualify or
modify, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner
adverse to Buyer, the ASBB Recommendation, or (ii) approve or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (each, an "
_Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to
the receipt of the Requisite ASBB Shareholder Approval, ASBB's board of
directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change if and only if:

  



   | (A)| ASBB's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with the ASBB Financial Advisor (or such other financial advisor
as ASBB may use) and outside counsel, that it has received an Acquisition
Proposal (that did not result from a breach of Section 7.3) that is a
Superior Proposal; 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (B)| ASBB's board of directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with ASBB's outside counsel, that a failure to make such Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with ASBB's board of
directors' fiduciary duties to ASBB and its shareholders under applicable
Law; 
---|---|--- 
  



    

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



   | (C)| ASBB's board of directors provides written notice (a " _Notice of
Recommendation Change_ ") to Buyer of its receipt of the Superior Proposal
and its intent to announce an Adverse Recommendation Change on the third
business day following delivery of such notice, which notice shall specify
the material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal (and include a
copy thereof with all accompanying documentation, if in writing) and identify
the Person or Group making such Superior Proposal (it being understood that
any amendment to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require
a new Notice of Recommendation Change, except that, in such case, the three
business day period referred to in this clause (C) and in clauses (D) and (E)
shall be reduced to two business days following the giving of such new Notice
of Recommendation Change); 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (D)| after providing such Notice of Recommendation Change, ASBB shall
negotiate in good faith with Buyer (if requested by Buyer) and provide Buyer
reasonable opportunity during the subsequent three business day period to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable ASBB's board of directors to proceed without an Adverse
Recommendation Change (provided, however, that Buyer shall not be required to
propose any such adjustments); and 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (E)| ASBB's board of directors, following such three business day
period, again determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with their fiduciary duties to ASBB and its shareholders under applicable
Law. 
---|---|--- 
  



  

7.2 Registration of Buyer Common Stock.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event, within 50
days) following the date hereof, Buyer shall prepare and file with the SEC
the Registration Statement. The Registration Statement shall contain proxy
materials relating to the matters to be submitted to ASBB's shareholders at
ASBB's Shareholders' Meeting. Such proxy materials shall also constitute the
prospectus relating to the shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger. ASBB will furnish to Buyer the information required to be included in
the Registration Statement with respect to its business and affairs and shall
have the right to review and consult with Buyer on the form of, and any
characterizations of such information included in, the Registration Statement
prior to its being filed with the SEC. Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by
the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of Buyer and ASBB will use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be delivered to the ASBB shareholders as
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective
under the Securities Act. Buyer will advise ASBB, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of Buyer Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement. If
at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Buyer or
ASBB, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Buyer or ASBB which should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the Registration Statement or the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other Party hereto and, to the extent required by
Law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall be promptly filed by Buyer with the SEC and
disseminated by the Parties to their respective shareholders.

  



    

 | 38| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Buyer shall also take any action required to be taken under any
applicable state Securities Laws in connection with the Merger and each of
Buyer and ASBB shall furnish all information concerning it and the holders of
ASBB Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall notify The Nasdaq Stock
Market of the additional shares of Buyer Common Stock to be issued by Buyer
in exchange for the shares of ASBB Common Stock.

  



  

7.3 Other Offers, etc.

  



  

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the first to occur of the
Effective Time or termination of this Agreement, each ASBB Entity shall not,
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, or
encourage, induce or knowingly facilitate, the making, submission, or
announcement of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions (except to notify a third party of the
existence of restrictions provided in this Section 7.3) or negotiations
regarding, or disclose or provide any nonpublic information with respect to,
or knowingly take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making
of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into
any agreement (including any agreement in principle, letter of intent or
understanding, merger agreement, stock purchase agreement, asset purchase
agreement, or share exchange agreement, but excluding a confidentiality
agreement of the type described below) (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ")
contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Transaction, or
(iv) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that
prior to receipt of the Requisite ASBB Shareholder Approval, this Section 7.3
shall not prohibit a ASBB Entity from furnishing nonpublic information
regarding any ASBB Entity or other access to, or entering into a
confidentiality agreement or discussions or negotiations with, any Person or
Group in response to a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal
submitted by such Person or Group (and not withdrawn) if and only if: (A) no
ASBB Entity or Representative or Affiliate thereof shall have violated any of
the restrictions set forth in this Section 7.3 (other than any breach of such
obligation that is unintentional and did not result in the submission of such
Acquisition Proposal), (B) ASBB's board of directors shall have determined in
good faith, after consultation with the ASBB Financial Advisor (or such other
financial advisor as ASBB may use) and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal, (C) ASBB's board of directors concludes in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law to
ASBB and its shareholders, (D) ASBB receives from such Person or Group an
executed confidentiality agreement containing terms no less favorable to the
disclosing Party than the confidentiality terms of this Agreement, and (E)
contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
Person or Group, ASBB furnishes such nonpublic information to Buyer (to the
extent such nonpublic information has not been previously furnished by ASBB
to Buyer). In addition to the foregoing, ASBB shall provide Buyer with
at least two days' prior written notice of a meeting of ASBB's board of
directors at which meeting ASBB's board of directors is reasonably expected
to resolve to recommend the Acquisition Agreement as a Superior Proposal to
its shareholders, and ASBB shall keep Buyer informed on a prompt basis of the
status and material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, including
any material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other material
terms thereof.

  



  

(b) In addition to the obligations of ASBB set forth in this Section
7.3, as promptly as reasonably practicable, after any of the directors or
executive officers of ASBB become aware thereof, ASBB shall advise Buyer of
any request received by ASBB for nonpublic information which ASBB reasonably
believes could lead to an Acquisition Proposal or of any Acquisition Proposal,
the material terms and conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal,
and the identity of the Person or Group making any such request or Acquisition
Proposal. ASBB shall keep Buyer informed promptly of material amendments or
modifications to any such request or Acquisition Proposal.

  



    

 | 39| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Except as specifically permitted under Section 7.3(a), ASBB shall,
and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries', directors, officers, employees, and Representatives to
immediately cease any and all existing activities, discussions, or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and will use and cause to be used all commercially
reasonable efforts to enforce any confidentiality or similar or related
agreement relating to any Acquisition Proposal.

  



  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent a Party or its
board of directors from (i) complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided, that_ such Rules will in
no way eliminate or modify the effect that any action pursuant to such Rules
would otherwise have under this Agreement; (ii) making any disclosure to
ASBB's shareholders if ASBB's board of directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such
disclosures would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with applicable Law;
(iii) informing any Person of the existence of this provisions contained in
this Section 7.3, or (iv) making any "stop, look, and listen" communication to
ASBB's shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to ASBB's shareholders).

  



  

7.4 Consents of Regulatory Authorities.

  



  

The Parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation and applications, to effect all applications, notices,
petitions and filings, and to obtain as promptly as practicable all
Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons which are necessary
or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger). The Parties agree that they will consult with each
other with respect to the obtaining of all Consents of all Regulatory
Authorities and other Persons necessary or advisable to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each Party will keep the
other apprised of the status of matters relating to consummation of the
transactions contemplated herein. Each Party also shall promptly advise the
other upon receiving any communication from any Regulatory Authority or other
Person whose Consent is required for consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement which causes such Party to believe that there
is a reasonable likelihood that any requisite Consent will not be obtained or
that the receipt of any such Consent will be materially delayed.

  



  

7.5 Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate.

  



  

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to
use, and to cause its Subsidiaries to use, its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including using its commercially reasonable efforts to lift or rescind any
Order adversely affecting its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein and to cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to in
Article 8; _provided, _ that __ nothing herein shall preclude either Party
from exercising its Rights under this Agreement.

  



  

7.6 Investigation and Confidentiality.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall keep the other Party
advised of all material developments relevant to its business and the
consummation of the Merger and shall permit the other Party to make or cause
to be made such investigation of its business and properties (including that
of its Subsidiaries) and of their respective financial and legal conditions as
the other Party reasonably requests, including, but not limited to,
conducting any environmental assessment with respect to any property;
provided, that such investigation shall be reasonably related to the
transactions contemplated hereby and shall not interfere unnecessarily or
materially with normal operations. No investigation by a Party shall affect
the ability of such Party to rely on the representations and warranties of
the other Party. Between the date hereof and the Effective Time, ASBB shall
permit Buyer's senior officers and independent auditors to meet with the
senior officers of ASBB, including officers responsible for the ASBB Financial
Statements and the internal controls of ASBB and ASBB's independent public
accountants, to discuss such matters as Buyer may deem reasonably
necessary or appropriate for Buyer to satisfy its obligations under Sections
302, 404, and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  



    

 | 40| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) In addition to each Party's obligations pursuant to Section 7.6(a),
each Party shall, and shall cause its advisors and agents to, maintain the
confidentiality of all confidential information furnished to it by the other
Party concerning its and its Subsidiaries' businesses, operations, and
financial positions and shall not use such information for any purpose except
in furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each Party shall
promptly return or certify the destruction of all documents and copies
thereof, and all work papers containing confidential information received
from the other Party.

  



  

(c) ASBB shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to exercise, and
shall not waive any of, its Rights under confidentiality agreements entered
into with Persons which were considering an Acquisition Proposal with respect
to ASBB to preserve the confidentiality of the information relating to ASBB
Entities provided to such Persons and their Affiliates and Representatives.

  



  

(d) Each Party agrees to give the other Party notice as soon as
practicable after any determination by it of any fact or occurrence
relating to the other Party which it has discovered through the course of its
investigation and which represents, or is reasonably likely to represent,
either a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement of the other Party or which has had or is reasonably likely to have
an ASBB Material Adverse Effect or a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as
applicable.

  



  

(e) Each Buyer Entity shall, in accordance with Buyer's comprehensive
written data security program established and maintained pursuant to 15
U.S.C. § 6801 and regulations promulgated thereunder (" _Buyer 's Security
Program_"), safeguard IIPI disclosed to that Buyer Entity pursuant to this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In
the event that any Buyer Entity allows a third party to access such IIPI,
Buyer shall ensure that the third party safeguards that IIPI in accordance
with a data security program substantially equivalent to the Buyer's Security
Program.

  



  

(f) Buyer shall notify ASBB promptly (but in no event more than 24
hours) of any Data Incident. All Buyer Entities shall promptly take
all actions that are necessary and advisable to correct, mitigate, and
prevent recurrence of the Data Incident. All Buyer Entities shall cooperate
fully with ASBB and its designees in all reasonable efforts to investigate the
Data Incident.

  



  

(g) If this Agreement is terminated prior to the Effective Time, each
Buyer Entity shall promptly return or dispose of, and certify the return or
disposal, of all IIPI received by the Buyer Entity in connection with this
Agreement. Any disposal of such IIPI must be performed in a manner that
ensures that the IIPI is rendered permanently unreadable and unrecoverable.

  



  

7.7 Press Releases.

  



  

Prior to the Effective Time, ASBB and Buyer shall consult with each other and
agree as to the form and substance of any press release, communication
with ASBB's shareholders, or other public disclosure materially related to
this Agreement, or any other transaction contemplated hereby; _provided,_
that nothing in this Section 7.7 shall be deemed to prohibit any Party from
making any disclosure which its counsel deems necessary or advisable in order
to satisfy such Party's disclosure obligations imposed by Law.

  



  

7.8 Charter Provisions.

  



  

Each ASBB Entity shall take all necessary action to ensure that the entering
into of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not result in the grant of
any rights to any Person under the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or
other governing instruments of any ASBB Entity or restrict or impair the
ability of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries to vote, or otherwise to exercise
the rights of a shareholder with respect to, shares of any ASBB Entity that
may be directly or indirectly acquired or controlled by them.

  



    

 | 41|

7.9 Employee Benefits and Contracts.

  



  

(a) All Persons who are employees of ASBB Entities immediately prior to
the Effective Time and whose employment is not terminated, if any, at or
prior to the Effective Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") shall, at the
Effective Time or the effective time of the Bank Merger, as applicable,
become employees of Buyer or Buyer Bank, as applicable. Buyer and Buyer Bank
shall honor all ASBB employment and change of control agreements existing as
of the date of this Agreement that have been disclosed to Buyer,
regardless of whether the employees with such agreements are Continuing
Employees or receive new agreements with Buyer. Buyer and Buyer Bank shall
honor the Bank Change in Control Severance Plan. All of the Continuing
Employees shall be employed at will, and no contractual right with respect to
employment shall inure to such employees because of this Agreement, except as
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

(b) As of the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall be employed
on the same terms and conditions as similarly situated employees of Buyer
Bank and eligible to participate in each of Buyer's Employee Benefit Plans
with full credit for prior service with ASBB solely for purposes of
eligibility and vesting.

  



  

(c) As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall make available employer-
provided benefits under Buyer Employee Benefit Plans to each
Continuing Employee on the same basis as it provides such coverage to Buyer
or Buyer Bank employees. With respect to Buyer Employee Benefit Plans
providing health coverage, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any pre-existing condition, eligibility waiting period, or other
limitations or exclusions otherwise applicable under such plans to new
employees not to apply to a Continuing Employee or their covered dependents
who were covered under a similar ASBB plan at the Effective Time of the
Merger. In addition, if any such transition occurs during the middle of a
plan year, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
such successor Buyer Employee Benefit Plan providing health coverage to give
credit towards satisfaction of any annual deductible limitation and out-of-
pocket maximum applied under such successor plan for any deductible, co-
payment and other cost-sharing amounts previously paid by a Continuing
Employee respecting his or her participation in the corresponding ASBB
Employee Benefit Plan during that plan year prior to the transition effective
date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in lieu of the same, Buyer may
continue ASBB's health and other employee welfare benefit plans for each
Continuing Employee as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(d) Reserved.

  



  

(e) Upon not less than 10 days' notice prior to the Closing Date from
Buyer to ASBB, ASBB shall cause the termination, amendment, or other
appropriate modification of each ASBB Benefit Plan as specified by Buyer in
such notice such that no ASBB Entity shall sponsor or otherwise have any
further Liability thereunder in connection with such applicable ASBB Benefit
Plans, effective as of the date which immediately proceeds the Closing Date.
Upon such action, participants in such applicable ASBB Benefit Plans that are
described in ERISA Section 3(2) shall be 100% vested in their account
balances.

  



  

(f) No officer, employee, or other Person (other than the Parties to
this Agreement) shall be deemed a third party or other beneficiary of this
Section 7.9, and no such Person shall have any right or other entitlement to
enforce any provision of this Agreement or seek any remedy in connection with
this Agreement, except as set forth in Section 7.12. No provision of this
Agreement constitutes or shall be deemed to constitute, an Employee Benefit
Plan or other arrangement, an amendment of any Employee Benefit Plan or
other arrangement, or any provision of any Employee Benefit Plan or other
arrangement.

  



    

 | 42| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) ASBB shall take all appropriate action to terminate any ASBB Benefit
Plan which provides for a "cash or deferred arrangement" pursuant to Code
Section 401(k) (each, a " _401(k) Plan_ ") prior to the Closing Date;
_provided, however_ , that Buyer agrees that nothing in this Section 7.9 will
require ASBB to cause the final dissolution and liquidation of, or to
amend (other than as may be required to maintain such plan's compliance with
the Code, ERISA, or other applicable Law), said plan prior to the Closing
Date.

  



  

(h) The board of directors of ASBB and each other applicable ASBB Entity
shall adopt resolutions terminating the ASBB tax-qualified employee stock
ownership plan (the " _ASBB ESOP_ ") immediately prior to and effective as of
the Effective Time (all shares held by the ASBB ESOP shall be converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration); to the extent necessary, the
Merger Consideration exchanged for the unallocated shares held by the ASBB
ESOP will be applied to the repayment of all outstanding ASBB ESOP
indebtedness; and the balance, if any, of the unallocated shares and any other
assets remaining unallocated shall be allocated and distributed to ASBB ESOP
participants as their interests appear, as provided for in the ASBB ESOP
unless otherwise required by applicable law. In the case of a conflict
between the terms of this Section 7.9(h) and the terms of the ASBB ESOP, the
terms of the ASBB ESOP shall control; however, in the event of any such
conflict, ASBB before the Merger, and Buyer after the Merger, shall use their
best efforts to cause the ASBB ESOP to be amended to conform to the
requirements of this Section 7.9(h).

  



  

7.10 Retention Plan and Conversion Bonus Plan.

  



  

(a) ASBB may implement a retention plan (the " _Retention Plan_ ") for
the benefit of those non-director employees of ASBB and its Subsidiaries (i)
with respect to non-executive officers, as determined by the chief executive

The undersigned is a director and/or an officer of ASB Bancorp, Inc. ("ASBB")

First Bancorp ("Buyer") and ASBB are considering the execution of an

In consideration of the substantial expenses that Buyer will incur in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and to
induce Buyer to execute the Agreement and to proceed to incur such expenses,
the undersigned agrees and undertakes, in his or her capacity as a
shareholder of ASBB, and not in his or her capacity as a director or officer
of ASBB, as follows:

  



  

1. While this letter agreement is in effect, the undersigned shall not, directly or indirectly: (a) solicit, initiate, or encourage, induce or knowingly facilitate, the making, submission, or announcement of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Agreement); (b) participate in any discussions (except to notify a third party of the existence of restrictions provided in Section 7.3 of the Agreement) or negotiations regarding, or disclose or provide any nonpublic information with respect to, or knowingly take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes an Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Agreement); or (c) propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

3. While this letter agreement is in effect, the undersigned shall not, directly or indirectly, except with the prior approval of Buyer, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, (a) sell or otherwise dispose of (other than in connection with the payment of the exercise price of outstanding options to purchase shares of ASBB Common Stock) or encumber (other than in connection with an ordinary bank loan) prior to the record date of ASBB's Shareholders' Meeting (as defined in the Agreement) any or all of his or her shares of ASBB Common Stock, or (b) deposit any shares of ASBB Common Stock into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any shares of ASBB Common Stock or grant any proxy with respect thereto, other than for the purpose of voting to approve the Agreement and the Merger and matters related thereto.

4. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that any remedy at law for breach of the foregoing provisions shall be inadequate and that, in addition to any other relief which may be available, Buyer shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief without having to prove actual damages.

  



  

5. The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to shares with respect to which the undersigned may have voting power as a fiduciary for others. In addition, this letter agreement shall only apply to actions taken by the undersigned in his or her capacity as a shareholder of ASBB and, if applicable, shall not in any way limit or affect actions the undersigned may take in his or her capacity as a director or officer of ASBB.
