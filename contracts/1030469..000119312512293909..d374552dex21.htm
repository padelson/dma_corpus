performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby are within Buyers corporate powers and have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Buyer.
This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of Buyer enforceable
against Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as such enforcement may be
limited by the Enforceability Exceptions.

Section 4.03. _Governmental Authorization_. The execution, delivery and
performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby require no material action by or in respect
of, or material filing with, any Governmental Authority other than (i) receipt
of regulatory approvals, consents or waivers, if applicable, from, and
expiration of all statutory waiting periods in connection therewith, the
following agencies: (A) the OCFI pursuant to the IBC Act, the Banking Act, and
certain conditions imposed by the OCFI in the OCFI Letter; (B) the Federal
Reserve under the BHC Act; (C) the FDIC under the Bank Merger Act; and (D)
FINRA pursuant to NASD Rule 1017, (ii) compliance with any applicable

aggregate, be material to Buyer or materially interfere with, impede or delay
the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer has not been advised in any
manner by any Governmental Authority, and otherwise has no reason to believe,
that any of the approvals referred to in this Section 4.03 will not be
granted.

 

Section 4.04. _Noncontravention_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby do not and will not (i) violate the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of Buyer, (ii) assuming compliance with the matters referred to in
Section 4.03, violate in any material respect any Applicable Law, (iii)
require any consent or other action by any Person under, violate, conflict
with, result in the breach of any provision of, constitute a default under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, modification

repay or offer to repay, any Indebtedness of Buyer or (v) result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of Buyer, with such exceptions
in the case of each of clauses (ii) through (v) as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on Buyer or
materially interfere with, impede or delay the transactions contemplated
hereby.

Section 4.05. _Financing_. (a) Buyer has not been advised in any manner by any
counterparty to a Subscription Agreement, and otherwise has no reason to
believe, that the transactions contemplated by any of the Subscription
Agreements shall not be consummated within three Business Days after the date
hereof. Prior to the execution hereof, Buyer has delivered to Seller true,
complete and correct copies of each Subscription Agreement. Each Subscription
Agreement is a valid and binding agreement of Buyer and, to the knowledge of
Buyer, the other parties thereto, is enforceable against Buyer and, to the
knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, in accordance with its terms
(subject to the Enforceability Exceptions) and is in full force and effect.
Buyer has performed all of the obligations required to be performed by it to
date under each Subscription Agreement in all material respects. Neither Buyer
nor, to the knowledge of Buyer, any other party thereto, is in default or
breach in any material respect under the terms of any Subscription Agreement
and, to the knowledge of Buyer, neither Buyer nor any other party thereto, has
received notice alleging the existence of any event or condition that
constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute such a
default or breach.

(b) Buyer (i) has (assuming the completion of the Buyer Capital Raise in an
amount not less than $66,000,000), and will have at Closing, sufficient cash
to enable it to make payment of the Purchase Price and any other amounts to
be paid by it hereunder, and (ii) is and will be at Closing (after giving
effect to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Buyer Capital
Raise, on a _pro forma_ basis) at least "well-capitalized," as defined in the
BHC Act. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither the consummation of the
Buyer Capital Raise nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Subscription Agreements shall be deemed a condition to Buyers obligation
to consummate the Closing. No regulator has indicated that it will condition
any of the Governmental Authorizations set forth in Section 4.03 upon an
increase in Buyers capital or compliance with any capital requirement,
standard or ratio, in each case that would not be satisfied by the completion
of the Buyer Capital Raise in an amount not less than $66,000,000, assuming
for this purpose that the closing under the Subscription Agreements
has occurred.

 



35 Section 4.06. _Regulatory Approvals_. To the knowledge of Buyer, there are
no facts or circumstances relating to Buyer or its Affiliates that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to, result in a
failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(a).

 

Section 4.07. _Purchase for Investment_. Buyer is purchasing the Transferred
Shares for investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale
in connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or together
with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
its investment in the Transferred Shares and is capable of bearing the
economic risks of such investment.

 

Section 4.08. _Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no action, suit,
investigation or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of Buyer
threatened against, Buyer before any arbitrator or any Governmental Authority
which is reasonably likely to materially interfere with, impede or delay the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 4.09. _Agreements with Governmental Authorities_. Neither Buyer nor
any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-and-desist or other order or
enforcement action issued by, or is a party to any written agreement, consent
agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a party to any commitment
letter or similar undertaking to or with, or is subject to any order or
directive by, any Governmental Authority that, in any such case, would
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, materially
interfere with, impede or delay the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, nor has Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries been advised by any
Governmental Authority that it is considering issuing, initiating, ordering or
requesting any such agreement, memorandum of understanding, letter,
undertaking, order or directive.

 

Section 4.10. _Finders  Fees_. Except for Jefferies Group Inc., whose fees
and expenses will be paid by Buyer, there is no investment banker, broker,
finder or other intermediary that has been retained by or is authorized to act
on behalf of Buyer who might be entitled to any fee or commission in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement from Seller
or any of its Affiliates.

Section 4.11. _Inspections; No Other Representations_. Buyer is an informed
and sophisticated purchaser, and has engaged expert advisors, experienced in
the evaluation and purchase of companies such as the Companies as contemplated
hereunder. Buyer has undertaken such investigation and has been provided with
and has evaluated such documents and information as it has deemed necessary
to enable it to make an informed and intelligent decision with

 



36  respect to the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement without
reliance upon any express or implied representations or warranties of any
nature made by or on behalf of or imputed to Seller, except as expressly set
forth in this Agreement. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has given Buyer
complete and open access to the key employees, documents and facilities of the
Companies. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or warranty, express
or implied, with respect to (i) any projections, estimates or budgets
delivered to or made available to Buyer of future revenues, future results of
operations (or any component thereof), future cash flows or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of any of the Companies or the future
business and operations of any of the Companies, (ii) any other information or
documents made available to Buyer or its counsel, accountants or advisors
with respect to the Companies or their respective businesses or operations or
(iii) any other matter (including the quality of PR Banks loan portfolio),
except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), as expressly set forth in this
Agreement.

the prospective 

 



41  issuer after giving effect to the Closing. Any investigation pursuant to
this Section shall not affect, modify or limit the representations and
warranties made in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered under
Section 8.02, or any resulting right to indemnification. Notwithstanding the

shall not have access to (A) (1) personnel records of any of the Companies
relating to individual performance or evaluation records, (2) medical
histories or (3) other information, in each case, which in Sellers good faith
opinion would cause Seller or such Company to violate Applicable Law or (B)
any information where such access or any related disclosure would (I)
jeopardize the attorney-client or other legal privilege of the institution in
possession or control of such information (unless, in such case, Buyer agrees
to enter into a joint defense agreement or other similar agreement that would
be reasonably expected to preserve such privilege) or (II) contravene any
confidentiality provision of any binding agreement (including with a
customer) entered into prior to the date of this Agreement if, in the case of
any such confidentiality obligation, Seller shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to have obtained consent of the relevant third party to
such access, in which case the parties hereto will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

(b) On and after the Closing Date, Seller will afford promptly to Buyer and
its agents reasonable access to its books of account, financial and other
records, information, employees and auditors to the extent necessary or
useful for Buyer in connection with any audit, investigation, dispute or
litigation or any other reasonable business purpose relating to any of the
Companies; _provided_ that any such access by Buyer shall not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of Seller. Buyer
shall bear all of the out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees, but excluding reimbursement for general overhead, salaries and employee
benefits) reasonably incurred in connection with the foregoing.

Section 5.03. _Notices to Buyer of Certain Events_. Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer of:

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



42 (c) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced
or, to Sellers knowledge, threatened, relating to Seller or any of the
Companies that, if pending or, to Sellers knowledge, threatened on the date
of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant
to Section 3.12;

(d) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that is likely to cause
any representation or warranty of Seller in this Agreement to be materially
untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that Sellers
failure to comply with its obligations under this Section 5.03(d) shall not
provide Buyer with a right not to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under Section 8.02, except to the extent the occurrence or non-
occurrence of such event would independently provide such right; and

 

(e) any change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.04. _Resignations_. At or prior to the Closing Date, Seller will
deliver to Buyer the resignations of all officers and directors of the
Companies set forth in Section 5.04 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules. Seller
will cause the delivery to the Buyer of resignations of all of the trustees of
any Employee Plan.

 

Section 5.05. _Monthly Reports_. From the date of this Agreement until the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 9,
Seller will cause the Companies to provide to Buyer such monthly financial
reports of the Companies that are prepared for management purposes and
provided to Seller, consistent with historical practice. Seller shall cause
the Companies to provide such reports no later than promptly following the
furnishing of such reports to Seller.

 

Section 5.06. _No Solicitation of Alternative Transactions._ Between the date
of this Agreement and the Closing or the earlier termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article 9, unless in connection with the sale of all or
substantially all of the business of Seller, Seller shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates and the Companies and their representatives not to, solicit,
knowingly encourage or initiate the submission of proposals or offers from,
provide any confidential information relating to any Company to, or
participate in discussions or negotiations or enter into any letter of intent
or agreement with, or authorize any financial advisor or other person to
solicit or initiate discussions or engage in negotiations with, any Person
(other than Buyer, its Affiliates and their respective representatives)
concerning (and in connection with) the transfer of any of the capital stock
of any Company or all or substantially all of its assets to a third party.

 



43 Section 5.07. _Cooperation with Buyer Capital Raise._ Seller shall use
its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide, and shall cause the
Companies and their respective representatives to use their reasonable best
efforts to promptly provide, to Buyer and its representatives such historical,

COVENANTS OF BUYER

Buyer agrees that:

Section 6.01. _Access_. On and after the Closing Date, Buyer will cause each
Company to afford promptly to Seller and its agents reasonable access to its
properties, books, records, information, employees and auditors in connection
with (a) the preparation of Tax Returns that are the responsibility of Seller,
(b) management and handling of any Tax audits and Tax disputes, (c) complying
with any request, subpoena, inquiry or investigation demand by any
Governmental Authority, in each case relating to any period ending on or
before the Closing Date, (d) to the extent necessary to determine any matter
relating to its rights hereunder or (e) for any other legitimate business
purpose, including the preparation of financial statements; _provided_ that
any such access by Seller shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct
of the business of Buyer or any such Company. Seller shall bear all of the
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys fees, but excluding
reimbursement for general overhead, salaries and employee benefits)
reasonably incurred in connection with the foregoing. This Section 6.01 shall
survive the Closing and shall continue in full force and effect, and Buyer and
the Companies shall maintain all such books and records, until the later to
occur of: (i) seven years after the Closing Date; and (ii) the expiration of
all applicable statute of limitations periods. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller and its agents shall not have access to (A) (1) personnel records of
any of the Companies relating to individual performance or evaluation
records, (2) medical histories or (3) other information, in each case, which
in Buyers good faith opinion would cause Buyer or such Company to violate
Applicable Law or (B) any information where such access or any related
disclosure would (I) jeopardize the attorney-client or other legal privilege
of the institution in possession or control of such information (unless, in
such case, Seller agrees to enter into a joint defense agreement or other
similar agreement that would be reasonably expected to preserve such
privilege) or (II) contravene any confidentiality provision of any binding
agreement (including with a customer) if, in the case of any
such confidentiality obligation, Buyer shall have used commercially
reasonable efforts to have obtained consent of the relevant third party to
such access, in which case the parties hereto will use their commercially
reasonable efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements.

Section 6.02. _Seller Marks Phase Out._ (a) Seller hereby grants to the
Companies a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable,
royalty-free license for a term of 60 days immediately after the Closing to
use the Seller Marks solely in connection with the conduct of the business of
the Companies substantially as conducted immediately prior to the Closing;
_provided_ that Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies to, cease use of
the Seller Marks as soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing in
accordance with this Section 6.02(a). As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Closing, but in any event, no later than 60 days immediately after the
Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies to, (i) cease all use of
the Seller Marks, (ii) deplete the labeling,

 



46  stationery, forms, supplies, displays, advertising and promotional
materials, manuals, and packaging existing in the inventory of the Companies
at the Closing that bear the Seller Marks (the "Materials") or remove,
destroy or strike over all Seller Marks from the Companies Materials, (iii)
remove Seller Marks from the Companies assets, websites, email and other
online materials and from all signage and other displays and (iv) no later
than 30 days after the Closing, file amendments to the Companies certificates
of incorporation, articles of association or other organizational documents
with the applicable Governmental Authorities changing the names of the
Companies to names that do not include any of the Seller Marks or any
Trademark that is confusingly similar to any Seller Mark; _provided_ that, as
soon as practicable after the date hereof, Seller shall assist Buyer in
developing a plan for Buyers phase-out of Seller Marks and Trademarks in
accordance with this Section 6.02(a). Any use by the Companies of the Seller
Marks during the limited license period provided in this Section 6.02(a)
shall be (A) solely in connection with goods, products and services that are
(x) the type of goods, products and services in connection with which the
Companies were using the Seller Marks at the time of the Closing and (y) of a
quality at least as high as the quality of goods, products and services
provided by the Companies immediately prior to the Closing and (B) subject to
all style and other usage guidelines in effect for the Seller Marks
immediately prior to the Closing. All goodwill associated with the use by the
Companies of the Seller Marks shall inure to the benefit of Seller or its
Affiliates, as applicable. Following the Closing, none of Buyer, its
Affiliates, or any of the Companies shall contest the validity or ownership
of any of the Seller Marks or adopt or employ any Seller Marks or any
variation or derivative of any Seller Mark or any Trademark that is
confusingly similar to any Seller Mark. For the purposes of this Section 6.02,
"Seller Marks" shall mean any and all Trademarks owned by Seller or any of
its Affiliates, including the Trademarks set forth in Section 6.02(a) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedules.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time, either
Buyer or Seller discovers any Trademark registration or application
(including any domain name registration) for any Seller Mark that is owned or
registered in the name of any of the Companies, the parties hereto shall take
all reasonable actions to promptly effect the transfer and assignment of
such Trademark registrations and applications (including any domain name
registrations) to Seller or one of its Affiliates (as determined by Seller).

(c) Without limitation of the foregoing in this Section 6.02, prior to the
Closing, Seller shall provide to Buyer such assistance as Buyer may reasonably
request with respect to Buyers design and implementation of alternate

6.02(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (the "Retained Domain Names");
provided that (i) 

 



47  Seller shall not be required to provide any such assistance to the extent
such assistance would unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of Seller and (ii) Buyer shall pay Seller for such assistance as
if such assistance were a New Service (as defined in Exhibit A) provided
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement during the term of the
Transition Services Agreement (it being understood that such assistance
shall be limited to the period between the date hereof and the Closing, that
the cost used to calculate clause (i) of the definition of Service Cost under
Exhibit A and the Transition Services Agreement shall include the costs of the
Companies, and that the applicable payment terms and invoicing requirements
set forth in the Transition Services Agreement shall apply to such assistance
mutatis mutandis).

Section 6.03 _. Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_. __ (a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and
agrees to cause the Companies following Closing to waive and not to assert,
any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation,
after the Closing (the "Post-Closing Representation"), of Seller, the
Companies or any of their respective shareholders, officers, employees or
directors (any such Person, a "Designated Person") in any matter involving
this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions contemplated hereby, by
any legal counsel that represented Seller or any of the Companies prior to
the Closing Date in connection with this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Current Representation").

 

(b) Buyer will not assert, and agrees to cause the Companies to not assert,
any attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between any
legal counsel and any Designated Person occurring during the Current
Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including
in connection with a dispute with Buyer, Seller or, following the
Closing, with any of the Companies, it being the intention of the parties
hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to control
such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by Seller and, Buyer waives
and will cause the Companies to waive, such attorney-client privilege, for
the limited purpose of giving effect to the foregoing; _provided_ that the
foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any
communication not involving this Agreement or any other agreements or
transactions contemplated hereby, or to communications with any Person other
than the Designated Persons and their advisors and is not intended to affect
the attorney-client privilege in any other context.

 

Section 6.04. _Notices to Seller of Certain Events_. Buyer shall promptly
notify Seller of:

 

(a) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 



48 (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

interfere with, impede or delay the transactions contemplated hereby;

(d) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event that is likely to cause
any representation or warranty of Buyer in this Agreement to be materially
untrue or inaccurate at or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ that Buyers
failure to comply with its obligations under this Section 6.04(d) shall not
provide Seller with a right not to effect the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement under Section 8.03, except to the extent the occurrence or non-
occurrence of such event would independently provide such right; and

 

(e) any change or event that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer or
materially interfere with, impede or delay the ability of Buyer to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 6.05. _Contact with Customers and Vendors_. Without prior written
consent of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned), Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, prior to the Closing
Date, contact any customer, vendor, supplier or employee of, or any other
Person having business dealings with the Companies, in each such case, with
respect to the Companies or any aspect of the transactions contemplated under
this Agreement.

Section 6.06. _Satisfaction of Liabilities; Director and
Officer Indemnification_. (a) Buyer shall cause each Company to satisfy its
liabilities and obligations on a punctual basis and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall, and shall cause each Company to,

officers of such Company in their capacities as such (each, a "Company
Indemnified Party") in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws, or other charter documents, of such Company to the fullest extent
permitted thereunder and not prohibited by

 



49  Applicable Law after the Closing Date against any and all damage, loss and

assigns or a Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or
conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or such Company, as
applicable, assume the respective obligations set forth in this Section 6.06.

(c) The provisions of this Section 6.06 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her
heirs and representatives.

 

Section 6.07. _Buyer Financing_. (a) Buyer shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Subscription
Agreements within three Business Days after the date hereof and shall keep

in a manner that would materially impair or delay Buyers ability to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, (b) take any action that to Buyers knowledge at the

condition or restrictions, in connection with the provisions of Sections 7.01
or 7.02 that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
or a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial

take (and shall cause its Affiliates to promptly take) any and all action
necessary, including (i) participating in and actively defending against or
otherwise pursuing any litigation that may be commenced by a Governmental
Authority or private party relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or
vacate or lift, any order that would have the effect of preventing or delaying
the Closing and (ii) resolving the objections, if any, that any Governmental
Authority or private party may assert under any Applicable Law with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and, consistent with the
foregoing, to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Applicable Law asserted by any Governmental Authority or private party with
respect to the purchase by Buyer of the Transferred Shares so as to enable the
Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including (A) restructuring,
selling, divesting or disposing of assets or businesses of Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the Companies), or committing to take
such actions and (B) otherwise taking or committing to take actions that
would limit Buyers or its Subsidiaries (including, after Closing, the

(d) Each of Buyer and Seller shall promptly inform the other party upon
receipt of any communication from any Governmental Authority or private party
regarding any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the extent

 



53  permitted by Applicable Law and not contrary to the request or requirement
of such Governmental Authority. If Buyer or Seller (or any of their respective
Affiliates or any of the Companies) receives a request for additional
information from any Governmental Authority that is related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made in good faith,
after consultation with the other party to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law and not contrary to the request or requirement of such Governmental
Authority, an appropriate response to such request as promptly as practicable.
No party shall participate in any meeting, or engage in any material

opportunity to attend or participate.

(e) Buyer shall advise Seller promptly of any understandings, undertakings or
agreements (oral or written) which Buyer proposes to make or enter into with
any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt and irrespective of whether the
purchase by Buyer of the Transferred Shares occurs, Buyer shall not require
Seller, any of its Affiliates or any of the Companies to, and neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to, take any action with respect
to any Applicable Law which would bind Seller, any of its Affiliates or any
of the Companies.

Section 7.03. _Public Announcements_. The parties agree to consult with each
other before issuing any press release or making any public statement with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and, except

obligation of consultation cannot be reasonably complied with, will not issue
any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation.

Section 7.04. _Transition Services Agreement_. From the date hereof until the
Closing Date, the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate (a)

Exhibit A hereto together with such additional services as may be mutually
agreed (collectively, the "Services") and (b) to prepare schedules that set
forth the terms and scope of such Services (the "Services Schedules"), which
shall specify that the Services shall be provided (i) for a transition period
of not more than twelve (12) months following the Closing and, except as

Closing, on the pricing terms on which those services

 



54  were provided prior to Closing (the "Historical Price") and (B) for any
period beyond the initial six-month period following Closing, at the
Historical Price _plus _ fifteen percent (15%). At Closing, Buyer and Seller
shall enter into a transition services agreement consisting of a "base"
agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B hereto and the Services
Schedules prepared in accordance with this Section 7.04 (Exhibit B and the
Services Schedules together, the "Transition Services Agreement").

 

Section 7.05. _Bank Merger_. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in no
event later than 10 Business Days immediately after the date hereof, (a)

have not already done so, Buyer (in its capacity as sole shareholder of Buyer
Bank) and the board of directors of Buyer Bank shall approve the Bank Merger,
(c) Seller shall cause PR Bank to execute and deliver to Buyer Bank a
counterpart to a merger agreement in the form of Exhibit C hereto with respect
to the Bank Merger (the "Bank Merger Agreement") and (d) Buyer shall cause

Agreement. The parties intend that the Bank Merger will become effective on
the Closing Date.

Section 7.06. _Non-competition; Non-solicitation_. (a) Seller agrees that
during the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date it will not, and it will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to: (i) control (within the meaning of the BHC Act, including the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any successor provision) any
insured depositary institution with its headquarters located within Puerto
Rico, (ii) open or operate a branch of Seller, or of any Subsidiary of Seller,
in Puerto Rico that engages in banking, insurance or broker-dealer activities
or (iii) actively market banking, securities brokerage or insurance products
and services to Persons in Puerto Rico (other than (A) as a result of
worldwide or region wide general media advertising not aimed primarily at
Persons in Puerto Rico, (B) to any Person or any of its Affiliates to whom
Seller or any of its Affiliates has provided products or services prior to the
date hereof and (C) to any Person or any of its Affiliates to whom Seller or
any of its Affiliates first provides products or services after the date
hereof so long as the marketing in connection with the first products and
services provided was not primarily directed to providing products
and services in Puerto Rico) (the activities referenced in clauses (i), (ii)
and (iii), the "Prohibited Activities"); _provided_ that nothing herein will
prevent Seller or any of its Subsidiaries from acquiring, and
thereafter owning, any entity or business (such entity or business, the
"Acquired Business") that directly or indirectly engages in any of the
Prohibited Activities so long as, at the time of the acquisition, the
Prohibited Activities account for less than 20% of the value (as determined
in good faith by the board of directors of Seller) of the Acquired Business.

 



55 (b) Seller agrees that during the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date it will not, and it will
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, solicit for employment or employ any
person who was in a senior vice president or more senior position with any of
the Companies on the Closing Date; _provided_ that (i) the foregoing shall
not apply to the Excepted Employees, (ii) nothing herein shall apply to any
person who has left the employment of the Companies other than as a result of
a breach of this provision and (iii) the non-solicitation restrictions of
this paragraph shall not apply to any general solicitations for employment,
such as any newspaper or Internet help wanted advertisement, or any search
firm engagement which, in any such case, is not directed or focused on
personnel employed by the Companies. As used herein, the term "Excepted
Employees" means the persons set forth in Section 7.06(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules.

 

(c) If any provision contained in this Section 7.06 shall for any reason be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Section, but this Section shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein
is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not
permitted by Applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any
extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of
no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable
under Applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and
interpret or reform this Section to provide for a covenant having the maximum
enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions (not greater
than those contained herein) as shall be valid and enforceable under such
Applicable Law.

 

Section 7.07. _Intercompany Accounts; Related Party Agreements._ Effective as
of the Closing, all Contracts and other intercompany arrangements between any
Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, shall be terminated and of no further force or effect, and none of the
Companies, the Seller or any of the Sellers Subsidiaries shall have any
further rights or obligations against each other with respect thereto, except
that the foregoing shall not apply to: (i) the Contracts and arrangements set
forth on Section 3.10 of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (disregarding the
cross reference to Section 3.11(a)(ix) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules
therein), (ii) any Derivative Contract entered into in the ordinary course of
business after March 31, 2012 and any related right or obligation, including
any collateral account with

 



56  respect thereto and (iii) any amount owed to a provider under any
intercompany services or similar arrangements entered into in the ordinary
course of business with respect to goods or service provided prior to the
Closing ("Service Fees"). For the avoidance of doubt, all intercompany
services or similar arrangements entered into from the date hereof until the
Closing Date shall be entered into in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice in all material respects. If any third party is
a party to any such Contract to be terminated the parties will use their
reasonable best efforts to implement the arrangements hereunder with
respect thereto. Immediately prior to the Closing each applicable recipient
shall pay all accrued and unpaid Services Fees owed by it except to the extent
such Service Fees cannot practicably be calculated as of such time, in which
case the amount that cannot be so calculated will be paid as promptly as
practicable after it can be so calculated. At the Closing the Companies and
Seller (on behalf of itself and its Subsidiaries) will enter into customary
arrangements effecting the termination described above and releasing all
claims each may have against the other with respect to the period ending on
the Closing, except for the matters set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
of the first sentence of this Section 7.07. 

Section 7.08. _Confidentiality_. (a) Buyer and Seller hereby agree to be bound
by and comply with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, which are
hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference, such that the
information obtained by Buyer or its officers, employees, agents, financing
sources or representatives during any investigation conducted pursuant to
Section 5.02, or in connection with the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
otherwise, shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement; 
_provided_ the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate upon Closing and
_provided, further,_ that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, (i) Buyer shall be entitled to use
any information regarding the Companies provided by Seller, the Companies or
their respective representatives pursuant to Section 5.07 in any Proxy
Statement, registration statement or other offering document, in each case,
relating to the Buyer Capital Raise, to the extent necessary so that such
Proxy Statement, registration statement or other offering document does not
contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and the information contained in any such Proxy Statement,
registration statement or other offering document may be included in other
documents and presentations with respect to the Buyer Capital Raise and (ii)
each of Buyer and Seller shall be permitted to file this Agreement in
accordance with applicable securities laws.

 



57 (b) Seller agrees that during the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates, officers, employees, agents and representatives to, keep
confidential any and all non-public information relating to the Companies,
including any technical, scientific, trade secret or other proprietary
information, together with any reports, analyses, compilations, memoranda,
notes and any other writings prepared by Seller or its Affiliates, officers,
employees, agents or representatives to the extent they contain, incorporate
or reflect such information, except (A) pursuant to the order, demand or
request of any Governmental Authority, as required in any litigation or other
proceeding, or as otherwise required by Applicable Law or administrative
process (in which case the disclosing party shall, to the extent it is
permitted to do so, provide Buyer prompt notice thereof and cooperate with
Buyer so that Buyer may seek a protective order or other appropriate
remedy), (B) for information that is or becomes part of the public domain
other than as a result of a breach of this Section 7.08(b) and (C) to the
extent that such information is or has become known to the Person receiving
such information from a source who, to Sellers knowledge, is not breaching
any contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation by making such disclosure, and
Seller shall not use, and shall cause its Affiliates not to use, the
information restricted by this Section 7.08(b) in connection with the conduct
of its or its Affiliates businesses or for any other purpose except as
required for financial or tax reporting or by Applicable Law, as necessary to
enforce its rights and remedies under this Agreement or for any other
legitimate business purpose that maintains the confidentiality of such
information and is not detrimental to the Companies.

Section 7.09. _Employee Benefit Matters_. (a) Seller shall, between the date
hereof and Closing, take any and all actions necessary to transfer the
employment of the employees set forth in Section 7.09(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedules, such that each such individual is no longer employed by
any of the Companies as of the Closing. Buyer agrees that, upon written
request by Seller, it will allow such individuals to continue to receive
medical benefits under the plans of the Companies at Sellers cost for a
reasonable period of time not to exceed three months following the Closing, to
be mutually agreed by Seller and Buyer.

 

(b) Buyer agrees that, with respect to the employees of the Companies as of
the Closing, it and the Companies will be responsible for all obligations
pursuant to all applicable severance and/or retention plans, arrangements and
statutory requirements arising (i) out of the transactions contemplated hereby
or (ii) after the Closing. In addition, Buyer expressly agrees to honor and
assume all obligations under the Retention Agreements.

(c) For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the one (1)
year anniversary thereof, Buyer shall provide to each employee of the

 



58  Companies as of the Closing who continues employment with Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (each, a "Continuing Employee") (i) a base salary or hourly
wage rate, as applicable, an annual bonus opportunity and employee benefits
(excluding any equity or equity-based incentive) that are in the aggregate
substantially comparable to the base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, annual bonus opportunity and employee benefits provided pursuant
to an Employee Plan (excluding any equity or equity-based incentive) to which
such Continuing Employee is entitled immediately prior to the Closing and (ii)
severance benefits that are no less favorable than those provided by the
Companies, as applicable to any such Continuing Employee, immediately prior to
the Closing, consisting of those severance benefits set forth in Section
7.09(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and those statutory severance
benefits required to be paid under Applicable Law.

(d) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee becomes a participant, for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and levels of benefits, but not for purposes
of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan, such
Continuing Employee shall receive full credit for service with the applicable
Company (or predecessor employers to the extent the Company provided such past
service credit prior to the Closing) to the same extent that such service was
recognized as of the Closing under a comparable plan of the applicable
Company in which the Continuing Employee participated.

(e) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in which any Continuing Employee is eligible to participate after
the Closing, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, to the extent
permitted under Applicable Law, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions and exclusions with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such conditions and
exclusions were satisfied or did not apply to such employees under
the welfare plans of the Companies prior to the Closing and (ii) provide each
Continuing Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid and
for out-of-pocket maximums incurred prior to the Closing in satisfying any
analogous co-payment, deductible or out-of-pocket requirements to the extent
applicable under any such plan.

(f) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 7.09 are included for the sole benefit of Buyer and Seller and
shall not create any right in any other Person, including, any Continuing
Employees. No provision in this Agreement shall create any right to
employment or to continued employment or to a particular term or condition of
employment with any of the Companies or Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 7.09 or any other provision of this
Agreement (i) shall be construed

 



59  to establish, amend, or modify any benefit plan, program or arrangement or
(ii) shall limit the ability of the Companies or Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any benefit plan, program
or arrangement following the Closing.

Section 7.10. _Certain Litigation Matters_. From and after the Closing, with
respect to any Litigation set forth in Section 3.12 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules to which both Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and
any of the Companies, on the other hand, are defendants, the parties shall
enter into a mutually acceptable joint defense agreement and shall cooperate
in good faith in the defense thereof.

Section 7.11 __. ___Certain Intellectual Property Matters_. (a) Prior to the
Closing, Seller shall transfer and assign to the Companies all of its right,
title and interest in and to the Transferred Software (including any
Intellectual Property Rights arising therefrom). Effective as of the Closing,
Seller hereby grants and shall grant to the Companies a perpetual,
irrevocable, royalty-free, nonexclusive license to use, copy, distribute,
perform, display and create derivative works of the Licensed Software. For
purposes of this Section 7.11, "Transferred Software" means (i) the software
set forth in Section 7.11(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules and (ii) any
other software owned by Seller and used exclusively in the business of the
Companies as currently conducted other than the Excluded Software, and
"Licensed Software" means any software owned by Seller and used primarily in
the business of the Companies as currently conducted other than the
Transferred Software and Excluded Software. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, except as provided in the Transition Services Agreement, Seller
shall not have any obligation to deliver, perform or provide any support,
maintenance, improvement or update with respect to any Transferred Software or
Licensed Software. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall deliver to the Companies
a copy of all source code and object code included in the Transferred
Software and Licensed Software, and all documentation associated therewith, in
each case to the extent that the Companies are not already in possession of
such source code, object code or documentation. The Licensed Software shall
be deemed added to Exhibit A, Appendix 1\.

(b) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to assign the licenses, in each
case to the extent that such licenses were paid for solely by the Companies,
to the software set forth in Section 7.11(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedules (the "Third Party Software") to the Companies, including, in the
event that the consent of the licensor of any Third Party Software is required
in order to effect such assignment, using reasonable best efforts to obtain
such consent; _provided_ that if Seller is unable to obtain any such consent,
Seller shall promptly notify the Companies in writing and shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable

 



60  best efforts to implement an appropriate alternative arrangement. The costs
relating to obtaining any such consents or implementing any such alternative
arrangements shall be borne solely by Buyer; provided that Seller shall not
incur any such costs without the prior written consent of Buyer.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Companies shall transfer and assign to Seller
all of their right, title and interest in and to the software set forth in
Section 7.11(c) of the Seller Disclosure Schedules (including any Intellectual
Property Rights arising therefrom) (the "Excluded Software"). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Companies shall not have any obligation
hereunder to deliver, perform or provide any support, maintenance, improvement
or update with respect to any Excluded Software. Prior to the Closing, the
Companies shall deliver to Seller a copy of all source code and object code
included in the Excluded Software, and all documentation associated therewith,
in each case to the extent that Seller is not already in possession of such
source code, object code or documentation.

Section 9.01. _Grounds for Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing:

 

(a) by mutual written agreement of Seller and Buyer;

 



62 (b) by either Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been
consummated on or before the one year anniversary of the date hereof (the
"Outside Date"); _provided_ that if Buyer has been unable to consummate the
Buyer Capital Raise despite being in compliance with its obligations
under Section 6.07(b), the Outside Date may be extended, by written notice
delivered by Buyer to Seller at least five (5) Business Days prior to the then
effective Outside Date, up to a date not beyond the end of the fifteenth month
following the date hereof; _provided, further_ , that the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(b) shall not be available to any
party whose breach of any provision of this Agreement results in the failure
of the Closing to be consummated by such time;

(c) by either Seller or Buyer if (i) any Governmental Authority that
must grant an approval referenced in Section 8.01(a) has denied such
approval, and such denial has become final and non-appealable or (ii) any
Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
non-appealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of
the Closing, unless, in either case, such denial of approval or issuance of
such order arises out of, or results from, a breach of any provision of this
Agreement by the party seeking to terminate this Agreement;

(d) by Buyer if a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Seller shall
have occurred that would cause one or more of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.02 not to be satisfied, and either (i) if such breach is of a type
that can be cured, such breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
days by Seller after receiving notice of such breach or (ii) such condition
would not reasonably be expected to be satisfied by the Outside Date;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.01(d) shall not be available to Buyer if it shall then be in material
breach of this Agreement; or

(e) by Seller if a breach of any provision of this Agreement by Buyer shall
have occurred that would cause one or more of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.03 not to be satisfied, and either (i) if such breach is of a type
that can be cured, such breach shall not have been cured within thirty (30)
days by Buyer after receiving notice of such breach or (ii) such condition
would not reasonably be expected to be satisfied by the Outside Date;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.01(e) shall not be available to Seller if it shall then be in
material breach of this Agreement.

 



63 The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(b),
Section 9.01(c), Section 9.01(d) or Section 9.01(e) shall give notice of such
termination to the other party.

Section 9.02.  _Effect of Termination_. (a) If this Agreement is terminated
as permitted by Section 9.01, such termination shall be without liability of
either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; _provided_ that if such termination shall result from (i) the
willful and knowing failure to perform a covenant of this Agreement or (ii)
any inaccuracy in a representation or warranty in respect of which the party
that made such representation or warranty knew, at the time such
representation or warranty was made, of facts that would cause such
representation or warranty to be untrue in a manner that would result in a
condition to Closing not being satisfied, then such party shall be fully
liable for any and all Damages reasonably incurred or suffered by the other
party as a result of such failure or breach. The provisions of this Section
9.02, Sections 7.08, 11.03, 11.04, 11.05, 11.06, 11.07, 11.08, 11.09, 11.10,
11.11 and 11.12, and the second to last and third to last sentences of Section
5.07 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 9.01. 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(b) or Section
9.01(c) and at the time of such termination (i) Seller is not in breach of
any provision of this Agreement in a manner that would cause one or more of
the conditions set forth in Section 8.02 not to be satisfied and (ii) there
exists no fact or circumstance that results in any representation or warranty
set forth in Sections 3.14, 3.15, 3.16 or 3.17 being inaccurate at any time
prior to termination, which fact or circumstance materially contributes to (A)
any denial or failure to obtain the regulatory approvals set forth in Section
8.01(a), (B) any order or injunction set forth in Section 8.01(b), (C) actions
by a Governmental Authority that have delayed or impeded the Closing such that
the Closing could not occur by the Outside Date (as the same may have been
extended pursuant to Section 9.01(b) or (D) a Materially Burdensome Regulatory
Condition, then Buyer shall (x) in the case of a termination by Seller, pay to
Seller an amount equal to $25,000,000 in immediately available funds (the
"Break-up Fee") within two Business Days of Buyers receipt of Sellers notice
of termination or (y) in the case of a termination by Buyer, pay to Seller the
Break-up Fee concurrently with (and as a condition to the effectiveness of)
Buyers delivery of notice of termination to Seller. If this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with its terms and such termination gives rise to the
obligation of Buyer to pay the Break-up Fee, the sole and exclusive remedy of
Seller and its Affiliates against Buyer and its Affiliates for any Losses or
other damages resulting from, arising out of, or incurred in connection with,
this Agreement (including any termination thereof) or any transactions
ancillary hereto shall be the Break-up Fee and no Person shall have any rights
or claims

 



64  against Buyer and its Affiliates under this Agreement, whether at law or
equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, and none of Buyer and its Affiliates
shall have any further liability or obligation resulting from, arising out
of, or incurred in connection with, this Agreement, in each case, except for
Section 7.08(a) and the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that if such
termination by Seller is pursuant to Section 9.01(b) and Buyers failure to
consummate the Buyer Capital Raise or Buyers willful and knowing breach of
this Agreement is the proximate cause of the Closing not having been
consummated on or before the Outside Date, and Seller has suffered
Termination Losses in excess of the amount of the Break-up Fee, Seller shall
be entitled to recover from Buyer such excess Termination Losses in an amount
up to an additional $25,000,000 in the aggregate.

 

ARTICLE 10

 

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 10.01. _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. All
representations and warranties made by any party in this Agreement or in any
certificate deliverable hereunder, and the covenants in Section 5.01, shall
survive the Closing Date until the date that is twelve months after the
Closing Date, except with respect to, and to the extent of, any claim of which
written notice in has been given in good faith and in reasonable detail by
one party to the other party prior to such expiration, which shall survive
until final resolution of such claim; _provided_ , that representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.05, 3.06, 3.26, 4.01, 4.02,
4.07, 4.10 and 4.11 shall survive the Closing indefinitely. All covenants and
agreements made by any party in this Agreement (other than the covenants in
Section 5.01, which shall survive as set forth in the preceding sentence)
shall survive until performed in full or the obligation to so perform shall
have expired.

Section 10.02.  _Indemnification_. (a) Effective at and after the Closing and
subject to the other provisions of this Article 10, Seller hereby indemnifies
Buyer, its Affiliates and the Companies, and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives (collectively, the "Buyer
Indemnified Parties") against and agrees to hold each of them harmless from
any and all Losses actually suffered by a Buyer Indemnified Party, whether or
not involving a Third Party Claim, to the extent attributable to or resulting
from: (i) the failure of any of the representations or warranties made by
Seller in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered hereunder to be true
and correct, (ii) any breach of covenant or agreement made or to be performed
by Seller pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) without duplication of any
amounts described in Section 10.02(a)(i) or (ii) (A) any Income Taxes or
Municipal License Taxes of the Companies apportioned to any Pre-Closing Tax
Period other than (1) amounts

 



65  reserved therefor in one of the Balance Sheets and (2) Taxes payable with
respect to income earned by, or gross receipts of or gross volume of business
of, the Companies during the period from the Balance Sheet Date through the
Closing Date and (B) any payments (other than payments owed to another
Company) owed by any of the Companies under any tax allocation, sharing or
indemnity agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not have any
liability under Section 10.02(a) for Taxes allocable to any taxable period (or
portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date.

(b) Effective at and after the Closing and subject to the other provisions of
this Article 10, Buyer hereby indemnifies Seller and its Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") against and agrees to hold
each of them harmless from any and all Losses actually suffered by any Seller
Indemnified Party, whether or not involving a Third Party Claim, to the
extent arising out of (i) the failure of any of the representations or
warranties made by Buyer in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered
hereunder to be true and correct, (ii) any breach of covenant or agreement
made or to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement or (iii) any
action taken by Buyer (or, after the Closing, any of the Companies) with
respect to any of the Continuing Employees.

 

(c) An indemnifying party shall not have any liability under Section
10.02(a)(i) or Section 10.02(b)(i): (i) until the aggregate amounts of Losses
incurred by the indemnified parties and otherwise indemnifiable under Section
10.02(a)(i) or Section 10.02(b)(i), as the case may be, based upon,
attributable to or resulting from the failure of any of the representations
or warranties to be true and correct exceeds $5,000,000 (the "Basket") and
then only to the extent of such excess and (ii) with respect to any given
failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct unless the
Loss from such failure exceeds $100,000 (and any Loss from a given failure
that does not exceed such amount shall be disregarded for purposes of
determining whether the Basket has been exceeded). An indemnifying party shall
not have any liability under Section 10.02(a)(i), 10.02(a)(iii) or
10.02(b)(i) for any Losses, individually or in the aggregate, in excess of
$25,000,000 (the "Cap"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Basket and Cap
shall not limit indemnification for Damages arising from a failure of a
representation or warranty set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.05, 3.06 or
3.26, of this Agreement (in the case of Losses incurred by a Buyer Indemnified
Party) or Sections 4.01, 4.02, 4.07, 4.10 or 4.11 of this Agreement (in the
case of Losses incurred by a Seller Indemnified Party) to be true and correct.

 

(d) For purposes of this Article 10, in determining (i) whether any
representation or warranty was not true and correct, any qualification
regarding a matter having a Material Adverse Effect (or words of similar
import with respect

 



66  to a Material Adverse Effect) in the representations and warranties in this
Agreement and any certificate delivered hereunder, other than in Sections
3.08(a)(ii) and 3.32 (or in any certificate delivered hereunder to the extent
in respect of Section 3.08(a)(ii) or 3.32), shall be deemed to be a
qualification as to the matter being material in the context of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or words of similar import
as the context requires) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the phrases
"material," "materially," "in all material respects" and similar phrases
(other than qualifications as to Material Adverse Effect) in
the representations and warranties in this Agreement and any certificate
delivered hereunder shall not be affected for purposes of this clause (i)) and
(ii) the amount of any indemnifiable Losses under Sections 10.02(a)(i) and
10.02(b)(i) arising from any failure of any representation or warranty to be
true and correct, the phrases "material," "materially," "in all material
respects" or similar phrases and any qualifications as to a Material Adverse
Effect in the representations and warranties in this Agreement and any
certificate delivered hereunder, other than in Section 3.08(a)(ii) (or in any
certificate delivered hereunder to the extent in respect of Section
3.08(a)(ii)), shall be disregarded.

(e) The right to indemnification based on representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being
acquired), at any time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or
inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreements, will not affect the right to indemnification or
any other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements (except to the extent, if any, otherwise expressly provided in such
waiver).

 

Section 10.03. _Third Party Claim Procedures_. (a) The party seeking
indemnification under this Article 10 (the "Indemnified Party") agrees to
give prompt notice in writing to the party against whom indemnity is to be
sought (the "Indemnifying Party") of the assertion of any claim or the
commencement of any suit, action or proceeding by any third party ("Third
Party Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder. Such
notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such Third Party Claim and the
basis for indemnification (taking into account the information then available
to the Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except
to the extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party.

 



67 (b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim and, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section, shall be entitled to control and appoint lead counsel for such
defense, in each case at its own expense.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.03, (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering
into any settlement of such Third Party Claim, if the settlement does not
expressly unconditionally release the Indemnified Party and its Affiliates
from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Third Party Claim or
the settlement imposes injunctive or other similar equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (ii) the Indemnified
Party shall not enter into any settlement of such Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party and (iii) the Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim
and to employ separate counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_
that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the
Indemnified Party, except that the Indemnifying Party shall pay such fees and
expenses to the extent both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
are named parties and representation of both the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party by the same counsel would create a conflict of interest (in
which case the Indemnifying Party shall pay for only one separate counsel for
all Indemnified Parties).

(d) In connection with the defense or prosecution of any Third Party Claim,
each party shall (i) cooperate, and cause its respective Affiliates to
cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of such claim, (ii) furnish or cause
to be furnished such documents, records, information and testimony, grant or
cause to be granted access to all reasonably requested witnesses, and attend
such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, in each
case as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith, (iii) take all
reasonable steps to make available to the other party, upon written request,
its former and current employees, other personnel and agents (whether as
witnesses or otherwise) to the extent that such persons may reasonably be
required in connection therewith. Neither Seller nor Buyer will (and each of
Seller and Buyer shall cause its respective Affiliates not to) destroy or
dispose of any documents, records or information related to the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim without first using its reasonable best
efforts to notify the other party of the proposed destruction or disposition
and giving the other party the opportunity to take possession of or copy such
documents, records or information prior to such destruction or disposition. 

 



68 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 10.03 shall
not apply to any Tax Contest governed by Article 12\.

Section 10.04. _Direct Claim Procedures_. In the event an Indemnified Party
has a claim for indemnity under this Article 10 against an Indemnifying Party
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party agrees to
give prompt notice in writing of such claim to the Indemnifying Party.
Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail such claim and the basis for
indemnification (taking into account the information then available to the
Indemnified Party). The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent such failure shall have actually prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

Section 10.05. _Calculation of Losses_. (a) The amount of any Losses payable
under this Article 10 by the Indemnifying Party shall be net of any (i)
amounts recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance
policies, or from any other Person other than the Indemnifying Party (pursuant
to this Article 10) alleged to be responsible therefor, and (ii) Tax benefit
realized by the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or payment of
any such Losses. If the Indemnified Party receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person other than the
Indemnifying Party (pursuant to this Article 10) alleged to be
responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by the
Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse the
Indemnifying Party for any payment made by such Indemnifying Party in
connection with providing such indemnification payment up to the amount
received by the Indemnified Party (net of any costs or expenses incurred or to
be incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such amount).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable under this Agreement for any (i) consequential, indirect,
incidental, special, exemplary or punitive Losses, (ii) Losses for lost
profits or opportunities or (iii) Losses specifically reserved on one of the
Balance Sheets.

 

(c) Each Indemnified Party must use its commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses for which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification
under this Agreement.

(d) Each Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
collect any amounts available under insurance coverage, or from any other
Person other than the Indemnifying Party potentially responsible, for any
Losses payable under this Article 10.

 



69 Section 10.06. _Assignment of Claims_. If the Indemnified Party receives
any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Losses pursuant to
this Article 10 and the Indemnified Party potentially could have recovered all
or a part of such Losses from a third party (a "Potential Contributor"),
the Indemnified Party shall, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable
Law, assign such of its rights to proceed against the Potential Contributor as
are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from the Potential
Contributor the amount of such payment.

Section 10.07. _Exclusivity_. Except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement or in the case of intentional fraud, effective as of the Closing,
Buyer waives (and will cause the other Buyer Indemnified Parties to waive) any
rights and claims Buyer, or any other Buyer Indemnified Party, may have
against Seller (or any of the Seller Indemnified Parties), whether in law or
in equity, relating to any Company or the Transferred Shares or other
transactions contemplated hereby. The rights and claims waived by Buyer and
the other Buyer Indemnified Parties include claims for contribution or other
rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental Law
(whether now or hereinafter in effect), claims for breach of contract, breach
of representation or warranty, negligence, misrepresentation and all
other claims for breach of duty. After the Closing, this Article 10 shall
provide the exclusive remedy for any of the matters addressed herein and any
other claims arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, except (i) as provided in Section 11.13 with respect to the covenants
and agreements to be performed after Closing; (ii) for the rights and remedies
under the Transition Services Agreement and (iii) for claims of intentional
fraud.

 

Section 10.08. _Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. All payments made by Seller
to or for the benefit of the Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to this
Article 10 and all payments made by Buyer to or for the benefit of the Seller
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article 10 shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by law, and such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this
Agreement. All payments to or for the benefit of the Buyer Indemnified Parties
under this Article 10 shall be made by or on behalf of Seller.

be brought in the United States District Court for the Southern District of

of such courts shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such suit, action
or proceeding, any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be
deemed to have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of New York,
and each of the parties hereby 

 



72  irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such suit, action or
proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of
any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any such suit,
action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each party
agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 11.01
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

Section 11.07. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY

Section 11.08. _Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were
upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each

party hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof
signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no
party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of
any other oral or written agreement or other communication). Except for

or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 

Section 11.09. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the Confidentiality

the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

Section 11.10. _Severability_. __ If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the
remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance
of the transactions contemplated hereby is

 



73  not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such a
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as

possible.

on the Seller Disclosure Schedules in Schedules thereof that correspond to
the Sections of this Agreement to which they relate. A matter set forth in one
Section of the Seller Disclosure Schedules need not be set forth in any other

Disclosure Schedules or to another section of this Agreement is reasonably
apparent on the face of the information disclosed therein. The parties
acknowledge and agree that the Seller Disclosure Schedules may include certain
items and information solely for informational purposes for the convenience
of Buyer and the disclosure by Seller of any matter in the Seller Disclosure
Schedules shall not be deemed to constitute an acknowledgement by Seller that
the matter is required to be disclosed by the terms of this Agreement or that
the matter is material.

ARTICLE 12

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 12.01. _Tax Returns Filed Prior to Closing_. Seller shall prepare or
shall cause to be prepared all Tax Returns required to be filed under
applicable law by the Companies on or prior to the Closing Date (taking into
account any

 



74  extensions received from the relevant taxing authorities), and shall be
responsible for the timely filing of such Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall
be true and correct and completed in accordance with applicable law, shall
accurately set forth all items to the extent required to be reflected or
included in such Tax Returns by applicable laws, regulations or rules, and
shall be prepared on a basis consistent with those prepared for prior taxable
periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by an intervening
change in law. Seller shall provide Buyer with a copy of such Tax Returns, as
filed with the appropriate Taxing Authority.

 

Section 12.02. _Allocation to Tax Periods_. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, Buyer and the Companies shall treat the Closing Date as the
last day of the taxable year of the Companies for all Tax purposes, and shall
take any necessary action to ensure such treatment. For the portion of the
Closing Date after the time of Closing, other than transactions
expressly contemplated hereby, Buyer shall cause the Companies to carry on
its business only in the ordinary course in the same manner as heretofore
conducted. For all other Taxes, and for all purposes of this Agreement, in
order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the
portion of any Taxes that are allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period
shall be (a) in the case of income Taxes and all other Taxes that are not
imposed on a periodic basis, the amount that would be payable if the taxable
year or period ended on the Closing Date based on an interim closing of the
books and (b) in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis,
the amount of such Taxes for the relevant period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which shall be the number of calendar days from the beginning of
the period up to and including the Closing Date and the denominator of which
shall be the number of calendar days in the entire period.

 

Section 12.03. _Tax Returns Filed After Closing_. Buyer shall prepare or shall
cause to be prepared all Tax Returns required by Applicable Law to be filed
by the Companies after the Closing Date, including Tax Returns with respect to
a Straddle Period. Buyer shall deliver to Seller any Tax Returns relating to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period no less than thirty (30) days prior to the applicable
filing deadline (taking into account applicable extensions). Seller shall be
entitled to review and comment on such Tax Returns, such comments to be
provided at least fifteen (15) days before such Tax Returns are due to
be filed, and Buyer and Seller agree to negotiate in good faith to resolve
any disagreements. In the event any disagreement between Buyer and Seller
cannot be resolved before such Tax Returns are due to be filed, such Tax
Returns shall be filed in accordance with Buyers reasonable determination;
_provided_ that in this event any amount indicated as due and payable on such
Tax Returns in respect of Taxes that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall
not be determinative of Losses. Buyer shall cause any amounts shown to be due
on Tax Returns that include Pre-Closing Tax Periods to be timely remitted to
the applicable Governmental Authority on or prior to the date such Taxes are
due.

 



75 Section 12.04. _Refunds Attributable to Pre-Balance Sheet Periods_. __
Buyer shall promptly pay or cause to be paid to Seller all refunds of Taxes
and interest thereon received by Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or the
Companies attributable to any Pre-Balance Sheet Tax Period.

 

Section 12.05. _Tax Contests_. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing
upon receipt by Buyer or any of the Companies of notice in writing of any Tax
Contest involving Income Taxes or Municipal License Taxes that relates either
to (i) any Pre-Balance Sheet Tax Period of the Companies, or (ii) any Tax
Return or Taxes in respect of which Seller has made a representation about
the accuracy or payment thereof pursuant to Section 3.19 and which may give
rise to a claim for indemnification under Article 10. Seller may, at its own
expense, participate in and, upon written notice to Buyer, assume the defense
of any such Tax Contest. If Seller assumes such defense, Seller shall have the
sole discretion as to the conduct of such defense and Buyer shall have the
right (but not the duty) to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from counsel employed by Seller. Seller
shall keep Buyer informed of the progress of any such Tax Contest and provide
copies of any correspondence with any Taxing Authority related to any Tax
Contests controlled by Seller. Seller shall not settle any such Tax Contest
without Buyers prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

Section 12.06. _Tax Cooperation_. Buyer, the Companies and Seller shall
cooperate fully, each at its own expense, as to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
pursuant to this Article 12 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with
respect to Taxes.

 

Section 12.07. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be borne 50% by Buyer and 50% by Seller;  _provided_ that
Buyer shall bear 100% of such charges and fees incurred in connection with the
Bank Merger. Buyer will file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation
with respect to all such Taxes, fees and charges.

executed by their respective authorized officers as of the day and year first
above written.
