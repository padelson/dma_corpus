"offering restrictions" required by Rule 902 under the 1933 Act.

 

(10) _No Integration_. None of the Partnership Parties nor any other

days after such date as shall be agreed upon by the Representative and
the Partnership (such time and date of payment and delivery being herein
called the " _Closing Date_ ").

Payment shall be made to the Partnership by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a single bank account designated by the Partnership against
delivery to the Representative for the respective accounts of the Initial
Purchasers of the Securities to be purchased by them. It is understood that
each Initial Purchaser has authorized the Representative, for its account, to
accept delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for,
the Notes which it has agreed to purchase. Wells Fargo, individually and not
as representative of the Initial Purchasers, may (but shall not be obligated
to) make payment of the purchase price for the Notes to be purchased by any
Initial Purchaser whose funds have not been received by the Closing Date, but
such payment shall not relieve such Initial Purchaser from its obligations
hereunder.

more global certificates (collectively, the " _Global Securities_ ")
representing the Securities available for inspection by the Representative not
later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business day prior to the
Closing Date and, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Issuers shall deliver
the Global Securities to DTC or to the Trustee, acting as custodian for DTC,
as applicable. Delivery of the Securities to the Initial Purchasers on the
Closing Date shall be made through the facilities of DTC unless the
Representative shall otherwise instruct.

 

(d) _Representations of the Initial Purchasers_. Each of the Initial
Purchasers, severally and not jointly, hereby represents and warrants to the
Memorial Parties that it intends to offer the Securities for sale upon the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the General Disclosure
Package. Each of the Initial Purchasers, severally and not jointly, hereby
represents

 



20  and warrants to, and agrees with, the Memorial Parties, on the basis of the
representations, warranties and agreements of the Memorial Parties, that such
Initial Purchaser: (i) is a QIB; (ii) in connection with the Exempt Resales,
will sell the Securities only to, the Eligible Purchasers, and in the case of
offers and sales outside the United States, upon the terms and conditions set
forth in Annex I hereto, which Annex I is hereby expressly made a part
hereof; and (iii) will not sell the Securities, nor has it sold the Securities
by any form of General Solicitation, without the prior written consent of the
Partnership. The Initial Purchasers have advised the Issuers that they will
offer the Securities to Eligible Purchasers at a price initially equal to
97.000% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued interest, if any, from
April 17, 2013. Such price may be changed by the Initial Purchasers at any
time without notice. Each of the Initial Purchasers understands that the
Memorial Parties and, for purposes of the opinions to be delivered to the
Initial Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement, counsel to the Memorial Parties
and counsel to the Initial Purchasers, will rely upon the accuracy and truth
of the foregoing representations, warranties and agreements, and the Initial
Purchasers hereby consent to such reliance.

U.S. or non-U.S. federal or state securities commission of any stop order
suspending the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the
Securities for offer or sale in any jurisdiction, or the initiation of any
proceeding for such purpose by any U.S. or non-U.S. federal or state
securities commission or other regulatory authority, or (B) the occurrence of
any event that makes any statement of a material fact made in the General
Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing Document, General Solicitation or
the Offering Memorandum, untrue or that requires the making of any additions
to or changes in the General Disclosure Package, any Issuer Free Writing
Document, General Solicitation or the Offering Memorandum, to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or order suspending the qualification or exemption
from qualification of any of the Securities under any securities or "Blue
Sky" laws of U.S. state or non-U.S. jurisdictions and (iii) if, at any time,
any U.S. or non-U.S. federal or state securities commission or other
regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification

use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such
order at the earliest possible time.

foregoing as they reasonably request.

 

 (d) _Continued Compliance with Securities Laws_ _. _The Issuers will

Act Regulations so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the
Securities as contemplated by this Agreement, the General Disclosure Package
and the Offering Memorandum. If at any time prior to the completion of the
distribution of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers to Eligible
Purchasers, any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of
which it is necessary (or if the Representative or counsel for the Initial
Purchasers shall notify the Issuers that, in their judgment, it is necessary)
to amend or supplement the General Disclosure Package or the Offering
Memorandum (or, in each case, any documents incorporated by reference
therein) so that the General Disclosure Package or the Offering Memorandum, as

omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made or then
prevailing, not misleading or if it is necessary (or, if the Representative or

of their intention to prepare such amendment or supplement) and will promptly
prepare, subject to Section 3(b) hereof, such amendment or supplement as may
be necessary to correct such untrue statement or omission or to comply with
such requirements, and the Issuers will furnish to the Initial Purchasers
such number of copies of such amendment or supplement as the Initial
Purchasers may reasonably request. If at any time an event shall occur or
condition shall exist as a result of which it is necessary (or if the
Representative or counsel for the Initial Purchasers shall notify the Issuers
that, in their judgment, it is necessary) to amend or supplement any Issuer
Free Writing Document so that it will not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they

 



22  were made or then prevailing, not misleading, or if it is necessary (or, if
the Representative or counsel for the Initial Purchasers shall notify the
Issuers that, in their judgment, it is necessary) to amend or supplement such
Issuer Free Writing Document in order to comply with applicable law, the
Issuers will promptly notify the Representative of such event or condition and
of their intention to prepare such amendment or supplement (or, if the
Representative or counsel for the Initial Purchasers shall have notified the
Issuers as aforesaid, the Issuers will promptly notify the Representative of

with the offering and sale of the Securities.

 

 (f) _"Blue Sky" and Other Qualifications_ _. _The Issuers will
cooperate with the Initial Purchasers to qualify the Securities for offering

jurisdictions (domestic or foreign) as the Representative may designate and
to maintain such qualifications and exemptions in effect for so long as
required for the distribution of the Securities (but in no event for a period
of not less than one year from the date of this Agreement); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Issuers shall not be obligated to file any general
consent to service of process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a
dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or
to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any jurisdiction
in which it is not otherwise so subject. In each jurisdiction in which the
Securities have been so qualified or exempt, the Issuers will file
such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of such
jurisdiction to continue such qualification or exemption, as the case may be,
in effect for so long as required for the distribution of the Securities (but
in no event for a period of not less than one year from the date of this
Agreement).

under the 1933 Act that have been acquired by any of them, except for
Securities purchased by the Issuers or any of their respective affiliates and
resold in a transaction registered under the 1933 Act or in accordance with
Rule 144 under the 1933 Act. 

 (o) _No Integration_. The Issuers will not, and will ensure that no
affiliate of the Issuers will, sell, offer for sale or solicit offers to buy
or otherwise negotiate in respect of any "security" (as defined in the 1933
Act) that would be integrated with the sale of the Securities in a manner
that would require the registration under the 1933 Act of the sale to the
Initial Purchasers or to the Eligible Purchasers of the Securities.

 



24 (p) _Additional Written Communications_. Before making, preparing,
using, authorizing, approving or referring to any Issuer Free Writing

for, or offer or sell, the Securities by means of any General Solicitation
(except as permitted in the next succeeding sentence) or (ii) engage in any
directed selling efforts (with respect to the Securities within the meaning
of Regulation S), and the Issuers will and will cause all such persons to
comply with the offering restrictions requirement of Regulation S with respect
to the Securities. Before making, preparing, using, authorizing or

Memorial Parties, their respective directors, each of their respective
officers and each person, if any, who controls the Partnership within the
meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, in each
case in connection with any one action or separate but similar or related
actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations
or circumstances. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written
consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any litigation, or any investigation or
proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or
any claim whatsoever in respect of which indemnification or contribution
could be sought under this Section 6 or Section 7 hereof (whether or not the
indemnified parties are actual or potential parties thereto), unless such
settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of
each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such litigation,
investigation, proceeding or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to
or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of
any indemnified party.

 

(d) _Settlement Without Consent if Failure to Reimburse_ _. _If at
any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to
reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as
contemplated by this Section 6, such indemnifying party agrees that it shall
be liable for any settlement of the nature contemplated by Section 6(a)(ii)
effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into
more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid
request, (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice of the terms
of such settlement at least 30 days prior to such settlement being entered
into and (iii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed such
indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of such
settlement.

 



30 SECTION 7. _Contribution_. If the indemnification provided for in Section
6 hereof is for any reason unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute
to the aggregate amount of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages and
expenses incurred by such indemnified party, as incurred, (i) in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Memorial Parties, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other
hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii)
if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law,
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the
Memorial Parties, on the one hand, and of the Initial Purchasers, on the other
hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations.

 

The relative benefits received by the Memorial Parties, on the one hand, and
the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of
the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same
respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the
Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by
the Memorial Parties and the total discounts and commissions received by the
Initial Purchasers, in each case as determined pursuant to this Agreement,
bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities as set forth on
the cover of the Offering Memorandum.

The relative fault of the Memorial Parties, on the one hand, and the
Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates
to information supplied by the Memorial Parties, on the one hand, or by the
Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.

 

The Memorial Parties and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined
by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one
entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not
take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this
Section 7\. The aggregate amount of losses, liabilities, claims, damages and
expenses incurred by an indemnified party and referred to above in this
Section 7 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, or any investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever
based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission.

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 7, no Initial Purchaser shall
be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the net
proceeds from the sale to Eligible Purchasers of the Securities initially
purchased by it exceed the amount of any damages which such Initial Purchaser
has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

 



31 No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

 

For purposes of this Section 7, each affiliate, officer, director, employee,
partner and member of each Initial Purchaser and each person, if any, who
controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933
Act or Section 20 of the 1934 Act, shall have the same rights to contribution
as such Initial Purchaser, and each director of each of the Memorial Parties,
each officer of each of the Memorial Parties, and each person, if any, who
controls the Partnership within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or
Section 20 of the 1934 Act, shall have the same rights to contribution as the
Memorial Parties. The Initial Purchasers respective obligations to contribute
pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion to the principal amount
of Notes set forth opposite their respective names in Exhibit A hereto and
not joint.

SECTION 8. _Representations, Warranties and Agreements to
Survive Delivery_. All the respective representations, warranties,
indemnities and agreements of the Memorial Parties and the Initial Purchasers
shall remain operative and in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser or the Memorial
Parties, and shall survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

 

SECTION 9. _Termination of Agreement_.

 

(a) _Termination; General_ _. _The Representative may terminate this
Agreement, by notice to the Partnership, at any time on or prior to the
Closing Date (i) if there has occurred any material adverse change in the
financial markets in the United States or the international financial markets,
any declaration of a national emergency or war by the United States, any
outbreak of hostilities or escalation thereof or other calamity or crisis or
any change or development involving a prospective change in national or
international political, financial or economic conditions (including, without
limitation, as a result of terrorist activities), in each case the effect of
which is such as to make it, in the judgment of the Representative, so
material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed
with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities or to enforce contracts
for the sale of the Securities on the terms and in the manner contemplated in
the General Disclosure Package and the Offering Memorandum, or (ii) (A) if
trading in any securities of the Partnership has been suspended or materially
limited by the Commission or the Nasdaq Global Market, or (B) if trading
generally on the NYSE, the Nasdaq Global Select Market or the Nasdaq Global
Market has been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices for trading
have been fixed, or maximum ranges for prices have been required, by any of
said exchanges or by order of the Commission or any other governmental
authority or (iii) if a banking moratorium has been declared by either
Federal or New York authorities.

 

(b) _Liabilities_ _. _If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to this Section 9, such termination shall be without liability of any party
to any other party except that the Memorial Parties shall be obligated to
reimburse the expenses of the Initial Purchasers as provided in Section 4
hereof, and except that Sections 1, 2(d) 6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18,
19 and 20 hereof shall survive such termination and remain in full force and
effect.

 



32 SECTION 10. _Default by One or More of the Initial Purchasers_. If one or
more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail at the Closing Date to purchase the
aggregate principal amount of Securities which it or they are obligated to
purchase under this Agreement (the " _Defaulted Securities_ "), the
Representative shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make
arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or any
other purchaser, to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted
Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms herein set
forth; if, however, the Representative shall not have completed such
arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:

 

 (i) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted Securities does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities, each of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount of such Defaulted Securities in the proportions that their respective underwriting obligations hereunder bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Initial Purchasers; or 

 

 (ii) if the number of Defaulted Securities exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of Securities, this Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting Initial Purchaser. 

 

No action taken pursuant to this Section 10 shall relieve any defaulting
Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of its default.

In the event of any such default which does not result in a termination of
this Agreement, the Representative shall have the right to postpone the
Closing Date for a period not exceeding seven days in order to effect any
required changes in the General Disclosure Package or Offering Memorandum or
in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein, the term "Initial
Purchaser" includes any person substituted for an Initial Purchaser under this
Section 10\.

 

SECTION 11. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder
shall be in writing, shall be effective only upon receipt and shall be
mailed, delivered by hand or overnight courier, or transmitted by fax (with
the receipt of any such fax to be confirmed by telephone). Notices to the
Initial Purchasers shall be directed to the Representative at Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC, 550 S. Tryon Street, 5th Floor, Charlotte, North Carolina
28202, Attention: High Yield Syndicate, fax no. (704) 410-4874 (with such fax

Attention: General Counsel, fax no. (713) 588-8301 (with such fax to be
confirmed by telephone to (713) 588-8300).

SECTION 12. _Parties_. This Agreement shall each inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the Initial Purchasers, the Memorial Parties and their
respective successors. Nothing expressed or mentioned in this Agreement is
intended or shall be construed to give any person, firm or corporation, other
than the Initial Purchasers, the Memorial Parties and their respective

 



33  successors and the controlling persons and other indemnified parties
referred to in Sections 6 and 7 and their successors, heirs and legal
representatives, any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in
respect of this Agreement or any provision herein contained. This Agreement
and all conditions and provisions hereof are intended to be for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the Initial Purchasers, the Memorial Parties and their
respective successors, and said controlling persons and other indemnified
parties and their successors, heirs and legal representatives, and for the
benefit of no other person or entity. No purchaser of Securities from any
Initial Purchaser shall be deemed to be a successor by reason merely of such
purchase.

SECTION 13. _GOVERNING LAW AND TIME_. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CLAIM,
CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW

created in respect of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
irrespective of whether or not any of the Initial Purchasers has advised or is

any event that no Initial Purchaser shall be deemed to have provided legal,
accounting or tax advice to the Memorial Parties or any of their respective
subsidiaries);

divisions and are subject to certain regulations and internal policies, and
that such Initial Purchasers research analysts may hold views and make
statements or investment recommendations and/or publish research reports with
respect to the Issuers and the Guarantors and/or the offering that differ
from the views of their respective investment

 



36  banking divisions. Each of the Memorial Parties hereby waives and releases,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any claims that the
Memorial Parties may have against the Initial Purchasers arising from the
fact that the views expressed by their research analysts and research
departments may be different from or inconsistent with the views or advice
communicated to the Memorial Parties by such Initial Purchasers investment
banking divisions. Each of the Memorial Parties also acknowledges that each of
the Initial Purchasers is a full service securities firm and as such from time

and irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in
any such court that any such action, suit or proceeding has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

---|--- 

Our identification of documents and information as part of the Pricing
Disclosure Package has been at your request and with your approval. Such
identification is for the limited purpose of making the statements set forth
in this letter and is not the expression of a view by us as to whether any
such information has been or should have been conveyed to investors generally
or to any particular investors at any particular time or in any particular
manner.

Because the primary purpose of our professional engagement was not to
establish or confirm factual matters, financial, accounting or statistical
information or reserve and production  information, and because many determinations involved in the preparation of
the Pricing Disclosure Package and the Final Offering Memorandum are of a
wholly or partially non-legal character, except as expressly set forth in
paragraph 8 of this opinion letter, we are not passing upon and do not assume
any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the
statements contained or incorporated by reference in the Pricing Disclosure
Package and the Final Offering Memorandum and we make no representation that
we have independently verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such
statements.

 

However, in the course of our acting as counsel to the Partnership in
connection with the preparation of the Pricing Disclosure Package and the
Final Offering Memorandum, we have reviewed each such document and have
participated in conferences and telephone conversations with representatives
of the Partnership, representatives of the independent public accountants for
the Partnership, representatives of the independent reserve engineers for the
applicable Specified Partnership Entities, representatives of the Initial
Purchasers and representatives of the Initial Purchasers counsel, during
which conferences and conversations the contents of such documents and
related matters were discussed.

Subject to the foregoing, on the basis of the information we gained in the
course of our participation in such conferences and conversations and our
review of such documents, we confirm to you that:

 

(a) The Incorporated Documents, at the time they were filed, appeared on
their face to be appropriately responsive in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, except that (i) we express no view as to the
financial statements, the notes and schedules thereto and other financial and
accounting data and oil and gas reserve and production information contained
or incorporated by reference therein or omitted therefrom, and (ii) we express
no view in this sentence as to the antifraud provisions of the U.S. federal
securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated under such
provisions.

(b) No information has come to our attention that causes us to believe that
(i) the Pricing Disclosure Package, as of [ _ _] (New York time) on
October 7, 2013 (which you have informed us is a time prior to the time of the
first sale of the Notes by any Initial Purchaser), contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading or (ii) the Final Offering
Memorandum, as of its date and as of the Closing Date, contained or contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omits to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that
in the case of each of clauses (i)-(ii) above, we do not express any view as
to the financial statements, the notes and schedules thereto and other
financial and accounting data and oil and gas reserve and production
information contained or incorporated by reference therein or omitted
therefrom. EXHIBIT H

jurisdictions as are necessary to permit Consummation of the Exchange Offer,
and (iv) upon the effectiveness of such Exchange Offer Registration
Statement, as promptly as practicable, commence the Exchange Offer. The
Exchange Offer shall be on the appropriate form permitting registration of the
Exchange Securities to be offered in exchange for the Transfer Restricted
Securities (other than Transfer Restricted Securities acquired by any Broker-
Dealer directly from the Issuers) and to permit resales of Transfer Restricted
Securities held by Broker-Dealers as contemplated by Section 3(c) hereof.

(b) The Issuers and the Guarantors shall cause the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement to be effective continuously and shall keep the
Exchange Offer open for a period of not less than the minimum period required
under applicable federal and state securities laws to Consummate the Exchange
Offer; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall such period be less than
20 Business Days after the date notice of the Exchange Offer is mailed or
otherwise delivered to the Holders. The Issuers shall cause the Exchange Offer
to comply with all applicable federal and state securities laws. No
securities other than the Exchange Securities shall be included in the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement. The Issuers and the Guarantors shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Offer to be
Consummated on the earliest practicable date after the Exchange Offer
Registration Statement has become effective, but in no event later than _
_ days after the Closing Date (or if such  _ _th day is not a Business
Day, the next succeeding Business Day) (such  _ _th day herein referred
to as the " _Exchange Deadline_ ").

 

(c) The Issuers shall indicate in a "Plan of Distribution" section
contained in the Prospectus forming a part of the Exchange Offer Registration
Statement that any Broker-Dealer who holds New Securities that are Transfer
Restricted Securities that were acquired for its own account as a result of
market-making activities or other trading activities (other than Transfer
Restricted Securities acquired directly from the Issuers), may exchange such
New Securities pursuant to the Exchange Offer; however, such Broker-Dealer may
be deemed to be an "underwriter" within the meaning of the Securities Act and
must, therefore, deliver a prospectus meeting the requirements of the
Securities Act in connection with any resales of the Exchange Securities
received by such Broker-Dealer in the Exchange Offer, which prospectus
delivery requirement may be satisfied by the delivery by such Broker-Dealer
of the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement. Such
"Plan of Distribution" section shall also contain all other information with
respect to such resales by Broker-Dealers that the Commission may require in
order to permit such resales pursuant thereto, but such "Plan of Distribution"
shall not name any such Broker-Dealer or disclose the amount of New Securities
held by any such Broker-Dealer except to the extent required by the
Commission.

 



-5- The Issuers and the Guarantors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
keep the Exchange Offer Registration Statement continuously effective,
supplemented and amended as required by the provisions of Section 6(c) hereof
to the extent necessary to ensure that it is available for resales of Transfer
Restricted Securities acquired by Broker-Dealers for their own accounts as a
result of market-making activities or other trading activities, and to ensure
that it conforms with the requirements of this Agreement, the Securities Act
and the policies, rules and regulations of the Commission as announced from
time to time, for a period ending on the earlier of (i) 180 days from the date
on which the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is declared effective and
(ii) the date on which a Broker-Dealer is no longer required to deliver a
prospectus in connection with market-making or other trading activities;
_provided_ that the Partnership may for a period (the " _Exchange Offer
Registration Statement Suspension Period_ ") of up to 45 days in any three
months period, not to exceed 90 days in any calendar year, determine that the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not usable under the circumstances
relating to corporate developments, public filings with the Commission and
similar events, and suspend the use of the Prospectus that is a part of the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement.

 

The Issuers shall provide sufficient copies of the latest version of such
Prospectus to Broker-Dealers promptly upon request at any time during such
180-day (or shorter as provided in the foregoing sentence) period in order to
facilitate such resales.

SECTION 4. _Shelf Registration_.

(a) _Shelf Registration_. If (i) the Issuers and the Guarantors are not
required to file an Exchange Offer Registration Statement or to consummate the
Exchange Offer for the New Securities because the Exchange Offer is not
permitted by applicable law or Commission policy; (ii) for any reason the
Exchange Offer for the New Securities is not Consummated by the Exchange
Deadline (unless an Exchange Offer Registration Statement has been filed
within _ _ days of the Closing Date and has not yet been declared
effective by the Commission, other than as a result of the fault of any Issuer
or Guarantor, and as a result of Commission review of data or information
included or incorporated by reference in such Registration Statement that
would also be included or incorporated in a Shelf Registration Statement, the
Issuers and Guarantors reasonably believe that a Shelf Registration Statement
would not become effective prior to consummation of the Exchange Offer);
or (iii) with respect to any Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities that is
not an Affiliate of the Issuer or Guarantors (A) such Holder is prohibited by
applicable law or Commission policy from participating in the Exchange
Offer, (B) such Holder may not resell the Exchange Securities acquired by it
in the Exchange Offer to the public without delivering a prospectus and that
the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement is not
appropriate or available for such resales by such Holder, or (C) such Holder
is a Broker-Dealer and holds New Securities acquired directly from the Issuers
or one of their Affiliates, then, upon such Holders written request within
six months of the first to occur of the Exchange Date or the Exchange
Deadline, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall (1) if permitted by law and
Commission policy, cause the Transfer Restricted Securities of such Holder to
be reissued in a form that does not bear any restrictive legends relating to
the Securities Act and

 



-6-  does not have a restrictive CUSIP number so that such Transfer Restricted
Securities may be sold to the public in accordance with Rule 144 under the
Securities Act by a person that is not an Affiliate of the Issuer or any of
the Guarantors where no conditions of Rule 144 are then applicable (other than
the holding period requirement in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of Rule 144 so long as
such holding period requirement is satisfied at such time of such reissue)
and (2) in the event the Issuers cannot or do not comply with the provisions
of the foregoing clause within 20 Business Days of the later of (I) the date
of receipt by the Issuer of such notice of such Holder and (II) the first to
occur of the Exchange Date and the Exchange Deadline (such later date being a
" _Shelf Filing Deadline_ "), then the Issuers and the Guarantors shall:

 

(x) as promptly as practicable cause to be filed a shelf registration
statement pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, which may be an
amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration Statement (in either event, the "
_Shelf Registration Statement_ ") on or prior to the Shelf Filing Deadline
which Shelf Registration Statement shall provide for resales of all Transfer
Restricted Securities the Holders of which shall have provided the information
required pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof; and

 

(y) use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Shelf Registration
Statement to be declared effective by the Commission on or before the 90th
day after the Shelf Filing Deadline (or if such 90th day is not a Business
Day, the next succeeding Business Day).

 

Each of the Issuers and the Guarantors shall keep any such Shelf Registration
Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as required by the
provisions of Sections 6(b) and (c) hereof to the extent necessary to ensure
that it is available for resales of New Securities by the Holders of Transfer
Restricted Securities by the Holders entitled to the benefit of this Section
4(a), and to ensure that it conforms in all material respects with the
requirements of this Agreement, the Securities Act and the policies, rules and
regulations of the Commission as announced from time to time, for a period of
one year following the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement
(or such shorter period that will terminate when all the New Securities
covered by such Shelf Registration Statement have been sold pursuant to such
Shelf Registration Statement or may be sold without a restrictive legend
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or any successor rule). Each of
the Issuers and the Guarantors shall be deemed not to have used commercially
reasonable efforts to keep the Shelf Registration Statement effective during
the requisite period if any of the Issuers or the Guarantors voluntarily takes
any action that would result in Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities
covered thereby not being able to offer and sell such Transfer Restricted
Securities during that period, unless (X) such action is required by
applicable law or Commission policy; or (Y) such action is taken by any of the
Issuers or Guarantors in good faith and for valid business reasons
(not including avoidance of the Issuers or the Guarantors obligations
hereunder) including, but not limited to, the acquisition or divestiture of
assets, so long as the Issuers and the Guarantors promptly thereafter comply
with the requirements of the last paragraph of Section 6(c) hereof (the
period during which the Shelf Registration Statement is not available under
clauses (X) or (Y) above, the " _Blackout Period_ "). The Blackout Period
shall not exceed 45 days in any three-month period or 90 days in any twelve-
month period.

 



-7- (b) _Provision by Holders of Certain Information in Connection with the
Shelf Registration Statement_. No Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities
may include any of its Transfer Restricted Securities in any Shelf
Registration Statement pursuant to this Agreement unless and until
such Holder furnishes to the Issuers in writing, within ten Business Days
after receipt of a request therefor, such information as the Issuers may
reasonably request for use in connection with any Shelf Registration Statement
or Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus included therein. Each Holder as to
which any Shelf Registration Statement is being effected agrees to furnish
promptly to the Issuers all information required to be disclosed in order to
make the information previously furnished to the Issuers by such Holder not
materially misleading.

SECTION 5. _Additional Interest. _If (i) the Exchange Offer is not
Consummated on or prior to the Exchange Deadline, (ii) a Shelf Registration
Statement applicable to the Transfer Restricted Securities required to be
filed by the terms of this Agreement is not declared effective (or does not
automatically become effective) on or prior to the 90th calendar day following
any Shelf Filing Deadline (or if such 90th day is not a Business Day, the next
succeeding Business Day), or (iii) a Shelf Registration Statement applicable
to the Transfer Restricted Securities required to be filed by the terms of
this Agreement is declared effective (or automatically becomes effective) as
required but thereafter fails to remain effective or becomes unusable in
connection with resales for more than 30 calendar days, excluding any Blackout
Period (each such event referred to in clauses (i) through (iii) above, a "
_Registration Default_ "), the Issuers hereby agree that the interest rate
borne by the Transfer Restricted Securities shall be increased by 0.25% per
annum for the first 90-day period immediately following the Exchange Deadline
and by an additional 0.25% per annum with respect to each subsequent 90-day
period, in each case for the period of occurrence of the Registration Default,
up to a maximum additional interest rate of 1.00% per annum thereafter ("
_Additional Interest_ "), until the earlier of the consummation of the
Exchange Offer and such time as no Registration Default is in effect, plus
such additional amount of time as is required under the last sentence of
Section 6(c), upon which Additional Interest will cease to accrue and the
interest rate on the Transfer Restricted Securities will revert to the
original rate; _provided, however_ , that, if after the date such Additional
Interest ceases to accrue, another Registration Default occurs, Additional
Interest will again commence accruing pursuant to the foregoing provisions.
In no event will Additional Interest accrue under more than one of the
foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) at any one time; _provided, however_ ,
that the amount of Additional Interest accruing on the Transfer Restricted
Securities shall not exceed, in any event, 1.00% per annum. The obligations of
the Issuers and the Guarantors to pay Additional Interest as set forth in this
Section 5 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Holders for any
Registration Default.

All obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors set forth in the preceding
paragraph that are outstanding with respect to any Transfer Restricted
Security at the time such security ceases to be a Transfer Restricted Security
shall survive until such time as all such obligations with respect to such
security shall have been satisfied in full.

SECTION 6. __ _Registration Procedures_. __

(a) _Exchange Offer Registration Statement_. In connection with the
Exchange Offer, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall comply with all of the
applicable provisions of Section 6(c)

 



-8-  hereof, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to effect such exchange to
permit the sale of Transfer Restricted Securities being sold in accordance
with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof. As a condition
to its participation in the Exchange Offer pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, each Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities shall furnish, upon
the request of the Issuers, prior to the Consummation thereof, a written
representation to the Issuers (which may be contained in the letter of
transmittal contemplated by the Exchange Offer Registration Statement) to the
effect that (A) it is not an affiliate (within the meaning of Rule 405 under
the Securities Act) of the Issuers or the Guarantors, (B) it is not engaged
in, and does not intend to engage in, and has no arrangement or understanding
with any Person to participate in, a distribution (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) of the Exchange Securities to be issued in the Exchange Offer
and (C) it is acquiring the Exchange Securities in its ordinary course of
business. In addition, all such Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities
shall otherwise cooperate in the Issuers preparations for the Exchange
Offer. Each Holder hereby acknowledges and agrees that any Broker-Dealer and
any such Holder using the Exchange Offer to participate in a distribution of
the securities to be acquired in the Exchange Offer (1) could not under
Commission policy as in effect on the date of this Agreement rely on the
position of the Commission enunciated in _Morgan Stanley and Co., Inc._
(available June 5, 1991) and _Exxon Capital Holdings Corporation_ (available
May 13, 1988), as interpreted in the Commissions letter to Shearman and
Sterling dated July 2, 1993, and similar no-action letters, and (2) must
comply with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the
Securities Act in connection with a secondary resale transaction and that such
a secondary resale transaction should be covered by an effective registration
statement containing the selling security holder information required by Item
507 or 508, as applicable, of Regulation S-K if the resales are of Exchange
Securities obtained by such Holder in exchange for New Securities acquired by
such Holder directly from the Issuers.

(b) _Shelf Registration Statement_. In connection with any Shelf
Registration Statement, each of the Issuers and the Guarantors shall comply
with all the provisions of Section 6(c) hereof and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect such registration to permit the sale of the
Transfer Restricted Securities being sold in accordance with the intended
method or methods of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto each of the
Issuers and the Guarantors will as expeditiously as possible, when required,
prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement relating to the
registration on any appropriate form under the Securities Act, which form
shall be available for the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities in
accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution thereof.

 

(c) _General Provisions_. In connection with any Registration Statement
and any Prospectus required by this Agreement to permit the sale or resale of
Transfer Restricted Securities (including, without limitation, any
Registration Statement and the related Prospectus required to permit resales
of New Securities by Broker-Dealers), each of the Issuers and the Guarantors
shall:

 (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to keep such Registration
Statement continuously effective and provide all requisite financial
statements (including, if required by the Securities Act or any regulation
thereunder, financial statements of the Guarantors) for the period specified
in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable; upon the

 



-9-  occurrence of any event that would cause any such Registration Statement or
the Prospectus contained therein (A) to contain a material misstatement or
omission or (B) not to be effective and usable for resale of Transfer
Restricted Securities during the period required by this Agreement, the
Issuers shall file promptly an appropriate amendment to such Registration
Statement (or file with the Commission a document to be incorporated by
reference into the Registration Statement), in the case of clause (A),
correcting any such misstatement or omission, and, in the case of either
clause (A) or (B), use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such amendment
to be declared effective and such Registration Statement and the related
Prospectus to become usable for their intended purposes as soon as practicable
thereafter, subject to the provisions applicable to Exchange Offer
Registration Statement Suspension Periods and Blackout Periods and the last
paragraph hereof;

 (ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and post-
effective amendments to the applicable Registration Statement as may be
necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective for the applicable
period set forth in Section 3 or 4 hereof, as applicable, or such shorter
period as will terminate when all Transfer Restricted Securities covered by
such Registration Statement have been sold; cause the Prospectus to be
supplemented by any required prospectus supplement, and as so supplemented to
be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the Securities Act, and to comply fully
with the applicable provisions of Rules 424, 430A and 430B under the
Securities Act in a timely manner; and comply in all material respects with
the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all
securities covered by such Registration Statement during the applicable period
in accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution by the
sellers thereof set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the
Prospectus;

 (iii) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, advise the
underwriters, if any, and selling Holders promptly and, if requested by such
Persons, to confirm such advice in writing, (A) when the Prospectus or any
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment has been filed, and, with
respect to any Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto, when the same has become effective, (B) of any request by the
Commission for amendments to the Registration Statement or amendments or
supplements to the Prospectus or for additional information relating thereto,
(C) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement under the Securities Act or of the
suspension by any state securities commission of the qualification of the
Transfer Restricted Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or
the initiation of any proceeding for any of the preceding purposes, and (D) of
the existence of any fact or the happening of any event that makes any
statement of a material fact made in the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, any amendment or supplement thereto, or any document incorporated
by reference therein untrue, or that requires the making of any additions to
or changes in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus in order to make
the statements therein (with respect to the Prospectus, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading. If at any time the
Commission shall issue any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement, or any state securities commission or other

 



-10-  regulatory authority shall issue an order suspending the qualification or
exemption from qualification of the Transfer Restricted Securities under state
securities or blue sky laws, each of the Issuers and the Guarantors shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal or lifting of such
order at the earliest possible time;

 

 (iv) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, furnish without
charge to each of the Initial Purchasers, each selling Holder named in any
Registration Statement if so requested by such Holder, and each underwriter,
if any, before filing with the Commission, copies of any Registration
Statement or any Prospectus included therein or any amendments or supplements
to any such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all documents
incorporated by reference after the initial filing of such Registration
Statement), which documents will be subject to the review and comment of such
Holders and underwriters in connection with such sale, if any, for a period of
at least five Business Days, and the Issuers will not file any such
Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to any
such Registration Statement or Prospectus (including all such documents
incorporated by reference) to which an Initial Purchaser of Transfer
Restricted Securities covered by such Registration Statement or the
underwriters, if any, shall reasonably object in writing within five Business
Days after the receipt thereof (such objection to be deemed timely made upon
confirmation of telecopy transmission within such period); _provided_ , that
this clause (iv) shall not apply to any filing by the Partnership of any
annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q or Current Report on
Form 8-K with respect to matters unrelated to the New Securities, the Transfer
Restricted Securities and the Exchange Securities and the offering or
exchange therefor. The objection of an Initial Purchaser or an underwriter,
if any, shall be deemed to be reasonable if such Registration Statement,
amendment, Prospectus or supplement, as applicable, as proposed to be filed,
contains a material misstatement or omission;

 (v) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, make
available during normal business hours for inspection by the Initial
Purchasers, the managing underwriters, if any, participating in any
disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement and any attorney or
accountant retained by such Initial Purchasers or any of the underwriters,
all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties
of each of the Issuers and the Guarantors and cause the Issuers and the
Guarantors officers, directors and employees to supply all information
reasonably requested by any such Holder, underwriter, attorney or accountant
in connection with such Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
thereto subsequent to the filing thereof (and each such Person shall agree
that it will keep such information confidential and not disclose any such
records, documents, properties or information unless (A) the disclosure of
such records, documents, properties or information is, in the opinion of
counsel to such Person, necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or
omission in such Registration Statement, (B) the release of such records,
documents, properties or information is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or
other order from a court of competent jurisdiction, (C) the records,
documents, properties or information in such records is public or has been
made generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure
or failure to safeguard by such Person or (D) disclosure of such records,

 



-11-  documents, properties or information is, in the opinion of counsel for any
such Person, necessary or advisable in connection with any action, claim, suit
or proceeding, directly or indirectly, involving such Person and arising out
of, based upon, related to, or involving this Agreement, or any transaction
contemplated hereby or arising hereunder) and prior to its effectiveness and
to participate in meetings with investors to the extent requested by the
managing underwriters, if any, if in connection with the Underwritten Offering
of Transfer Restricted Securities of an aggregate principal amount of
$100,000,000 or greater;

 

 (vi) in connection with an Underwritten Offering, if requested by any
selling Holders or the underwriters, if any, promptly incorporate in any
Registration Statement or Prospectus, pursuant to a supplement or post-
effective amendment if necessary, such information as such selling Holders and
underwriters, if any, may reasonably request to have included therein,
including, without limitation, information relating to the "Plan of
Distribution" of the Transfer Restricted Securities, information with respect
to the principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities being sold to such
underwriters, the purchase price being paid therefor and any other terms of
the offering of the Transfer Restricted Securities to be sold in such
offering; and make all required filings of such prospectus supplement
or post-effective amendment as soon as practicable after the Issuers are
notified of the matters to be incorporated in such prospectus supplement or
post-effective amendment, subject to the provisions applicable to the Exchange
Offer Registration Statement Suspension Periods and Blackout Periods and the
last paragraph hereof;

 

 (vii) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, furnish to each
Initial Purchaser, each selling Holder if requested and each of the
underwriters, if any, without charge, at least one copy of the Registration
Statement, as first filed with the Commission, and of each amendment thereto,
including financial statements and schedules, but without all documents
incorporated by reference therein or exhibits thereto (including exhibits
incorporated therein by reference), unless requested;

 

 (viii) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, deliver to each
selling Holder if requested and each of the underwriters, if any, without
charge, as many copies of the Prospectus (including each preliminary
prospectus) and any amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons reasonably
may request; each of the Issuers and the Guarantors hereby consents to the
use of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto by each of the
selling Holders and each of the underwriters, if any, in connection with the
offering and the sale of the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the
Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto;

 (ix) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, enter into such
customary agreements (including an underwriting agreement in form, scope and
substance as is customary in underwritten offerings of debt securities similar
to the Transfer Restricted Securities, as may be appropriate in the
circumstances), and make such representations and warranties, and take all
such other actions in connection therewith as is customary in offerings of
debt securities similar to the Transfer Restricted Securities in order to 

 



-12-  expedite or facilitate the disposition of the Transfer Restricted Securities
pursuant to any Registration Statement contemplated by this Agreement, all to
such extent as may be reasonably requested by any Initial Purchaser or by any
Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities or underwriter in connection with any
sale or resale pursuant to any Registration Statement contemplated by this
Agreement; and, whether or not an underwriting agreement is entered into and
whether or not the registration is an Underwritten Registration, each of the
Issuers and the Guarantors shall:

 

(A) furnish to each Initial Purchaser, each selling Holder and each
underwriter, if any, in such substance and scope as they may request and as
are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in primary underwritten
offerings, upon the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement:

 

 (1) a certificate, dated the date of effectiveness of the Shelf
Registration Statement signed by (x) the Chief Executive Officer, President
or any Vice President and (y) the principal financial or accounting officer of
each of the Issuers and the Guarantors (or their general partner or sole
member, as applicable), confirming, as of the date thereof, the matters set
forth in Section 5(c) of the Purchase Agreement (to the extent applicable) and
such other matters as such parties may reasonably request;

 

 (2) an opinion, dated the date of effectiveness of the Shelf
Registration Statement, as the case may be, of counsel for the Issuers and
the Guarantors, covering the matters set forth in Section 5(a) of the Purchase
Agreement and such other matter as such parties may reasonably request, and in
any event including a statement to the effect that such counsel has
participated in conferences with officers and other representatives of the
Issuers and the Guarantors, representatives of the independent public
accountants for the Issuers and the Guarantors, representatives of the
underwriters, if any, and counsel to the underwriters, if any, in connection
with the preparation of such Shelf Registration Statement and the related
Prospectus and have considered the matters required to be stated therein and
the statements contained therein, although such counsel has not independently
verified the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such statements; and that
such counsel advises that, on the basis of the foregoing, no facts came to
such counsels attention that caused such counsel to believe that the Shelf
Registration Statement, at the time such Shelf Registration Statement or any
post-effective amendment thereto became effective, contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
or that the Prospectus contained in such Registration Statement as of its date
contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Without limiting
the foregoing, 

 



-13-  such counsel may state further that such counsel assumes no responsibility
for, and has not independently verified, the accuracy, completeness or
fairness of the financial statements, notes and schedules and other
financial, accounting and reserve data included in any Shelf Registration
Statement contemplated by this Agreement or the related Prospectus;

 

 (3) a customary comfort letter, dated the date of effectiveness of the
Shelf Registration Statement, from the Partnerships independent accountants,
in the customary form and covering matters of the type customarily requested
to be covered in comfort letters by underwriters in connection with primary
underwritten offerings, and covering or affirming the matters set forth in
the comfort letters delivered pursuant to Section 5(d) of the Purchase
Agreement, without exception, provided that to be an addressee of the comfort
letter, if requested by the applicable accountant, each Initial Purchaser,
underwriter and selling Holder may be required to confirm that it is in the
category of person to whom a comfort letter may be delivered in accordance
with applicable accounting literature; and

 

 (4) a customary comfort letter, dated the date of effectiveness of the
Shelf Registration Statement, from any of the Partnerships independent
petroleum engineers whose reports are referenced in the Shelf Registration
Statement or any document incorporated by reference into the Shelf
Registration Statement, in the customary form and covering matters of the
type customarily requested to be covered in comfort letters by underwriters in
connection with primary underwritten offerings.

 

(B) set forth in full or incorporate by reference in the underwriting
agreement, if any, the indemnification provisions and procedures of Section 8
hereof with respect to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to said Section;
and

 

(C) deliver such other documents and certificates as may be reasonably
requested by such parties to evidence compliance with Section 6(c)(ix)(A)
hereof and with any customary conditions contained in the underwriting
agreement or other agreement entered into by the Issuers or any of the
Guarantors pursuant to this Section 6(c)(ix), if any.

If at any time the representations and warranties of the Issuers and the
Guarantors contemplated in Section 6(c)(ix)(A)(1) hereof cease to be true and
correct, the Issuers or the Guarantors shall so advise the Initial Purchasers
and the underwriters, if any, and each selling Holder promptly and, if
requested by such Persons, shall confirm such advice in writing;

(x) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, prior to any public
offering of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration
Statement, cooperate with the selling Holders, the underwriters, if any, and
their respective counsel in connection with the registration and qualification
of the Transfer Restricted Securities under the state securities or blue sky
laws of such jurisdictions as the selling Holders or underwriters, if any, may
reasonably request and do any and all other acts or things 

 



-14-  necessary or advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of
the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement; _provided, however_ , that none of the Issuers nor the Guarantors
shall be required to register or qualify as a foreign entity where it is not
then so qualified or to take any action that would subject it to the service
of process in suits or to taxation in any jurisdiction where it is not then
so subject;

(xi) shall issue, upon the request of any Holder of New
Securities covered by the Exchange Offer Registration Statement, in
connection with the Consummation of the Exchange Offer and in accordance with
the Indenture, Exchange Securities having an aggregate principal amount equal
to the aggregate principal amount of New Securities surrendered to the
Issuers by such Holder in exchange therefore;

(xii) in connection with an Underwritten Offering, cooperate with the
selling Holders and the underwriters, if any, to facilitate the timely
preparation and delivery of certificates representing Transfer Restricted
Securities to be sold and not bearing any restrictive legends; and enable
such Transfer Restricted Securities to be in such denominations and registered
in such names as the Holders or the underwriters, if any, may request at least
two Business Days prior to any sale of Transfer Restricted Securities made by
such Holders or underwriters;

(xiii) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Transfer Restricted Securities covered by the
Registration Statement to be registered with or approved by such other
domestic governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable
the seller or sellers thereof or the underwriters, if any, to consummate the
disposition of such Transfer Restricted Securities, subject to the proviso
contained in Section 6(c)(x) hereof;

 

(xiv) if any fact or event contemplated by Section 6(c)(iii)(D) hereof shall
exist or have occurred, prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to
the Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any document incorporated
therein by reference or file any other required document so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of Transfer Restricted Securities, the
Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
subject to the provisions applicable to Exchange Offer Registration Statement
Suspension Periods and Blackout Periods and the last paragraph hereof;

 

(xv) provide a CUSIP number for all Exchange Securities not later than the
effective date of the Registration Statement covering such Exchange
Securities and provide the Trustee under the Indenture with printed
certificates for such Exchange Securities which are in a form eligible for
deposit with the Depository Trust Company and take all other action
reasonably necessary to ensure that all such Exchange Securities are eligible
for deposit with the Depository Trust Company;

 

(xvi) cooperate and assist in any filings required to be made with the FINRA
and in the performance of any due diligence investigation by any underwriter
(including

 



-15-  any "qualified independent underwriter" as that term is defined within the
rules and regulations of the FINRA) that is required to be retained in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the FINRA;

(xvii) otherwise use commercially reasonable efforts to comply in all
material respects with all applicable rules and regulations of the
Commission, and make generally available to its security holders, as soon as
reasonably practicable, a consolidated earnings statement meeting the
requirements of Rule 158 under the Securities Act (which need not be audited)
for the twelve-month period (A) commencing at the end of any fiscal quarter in
which Transfer Restricted Securities are sold to underwriters in a firm
commitment or best efforts Underwritten Offering or (B) if not sold to
underwriters in such an offering, beginning with the first month of the
Issuers first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the
Registration Statement;

 

(xviii) cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust Indenture Act not
later than the effective date of the first Registration Statement required by
this Agreement, and, in connection therewith, cooperate with the Trustee and
the Holders of the New Securities to effect such changes to the Indenture as
may be required for such Indenture to be so qualified in accordance with the
terms of the Trust Indenture Act; and to execute and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents that may be
required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required
to be filed with the Commission to enable such Indenture to be so qualified
in a timely manner; and

 

(xix) in the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, cause all Transfer
Restricted Securities covered by such Shelf Registration Statement to be
listed on each securities exchange or automated quotation system on which
similar securities issued by the Issuers are then listed if requested by the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of New Securities or the
managing underwriters, if any.

Each Holder agrees by acquisition of a Transfer Restricted Security that,
upon receipt of any notice from the Issuers of the existence of any fact of
the kind described in Section 6(c)(iii)(D) hereof or any Exchange Offer
Registration Statement Suspension Period described in Section 3(c) or any
Blackout Period described in Section 4(a) hereof, such Holder will forthwith
discontinue disposition of Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to the
applicable Registration Statement until such Holders receipt of the copies of
the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(c)(xiv)
hereof, or until it is advised in writing (the " _Advice_ ") by the Issuers
that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of
any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated by reference in
the Prospectus. If so directed by the Issuers, each Holder will deliver to the
Issuers (at the Issuers expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies
then in such Holders possession, of the Prospectus covering such Transfer
Restricted Securities that was current at the time of receipt of such notice.
In the event the Issuers shall give any such notice, the time period regarding
the effectiveness of such Registration Statement set forth in Section 3 or 4
hereof, as applicable, shall be extended by the number of days during the
period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to
Section 6(c)(iii)(D) hereof or notice of any Exchange Offer Registration
Statement

 



-16-  Suspension Period and Blackout Period to and including the date when each
selling Holder covered by such Registration Statement shall have received the
copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section
6(c)(xiv) hereof or shall have received the Advice.

SECTION 7. _Registration Expenses_.

(a) All expenses incident to the Issuers and the Guarantors
performance of or compliance with this Agreement will be borne by the Issuers
and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, regardless of whether a
Registration Statement becomes effective, including, without limitation: (i)
all registration and filing fees and expenses (including filings made by any
Initial Purchaser or Holder with the FINRA (and, if applicable, the fees and
expenses of any "qualified independent underwriter" and its counsel that may
be required by the rules and regulations of the FINRA)); (ii) all fees and
expenses of compliance with federal securities and state securities or blue
sky laws; (iii) all expenses of printing (including printing certificates for
the Exchange Securities to be issued in the Exchange Offer and printing of
Prospectuses), if any, messenger and delivery services and telephone; (iv) all
fees and disbursements of counsel for the Issuers, the Guarantors and,
subject to Section 7(b) hereof, the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities;
(v) all fees and disbursements of independent certified public accountants of
the Issuers and the Guarantors (including the expenses of any special audit
and comfort letters required by or incident to such performance); (vi) all
application and filing fees in connection with listing the Exchange Securities
on a securities exchange or automated quotation system pursuant to
the requirements thereof; and (vii) all fees and disbursements of the Trustee
and its counsel; _provided_ that all underwriting discounts and commissions
and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the sale or disposition of a
Holders Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration
Statement shall be the responsibility of each Holder.

 

Each of the Issuers and the Guarantors will, in any event, bear its internal
expenses (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its
officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expenses of
any annual audit and the fees and expenses of any Person, including special
experts, retained by the Issuers or the Guarantors.

 

(b) In connection with any Shelf Registration Statement required by this
Agreement, the Issuers and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, will
reimburse the Initial Purchasers and the Holders of Transfer Restricted
Securities being registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, as
applicable, for the reasonable fees and disbursements of not more than one
counsel, who shall be Latham and Watkins LLP or such other counsel as may be
chosen by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Transfer
Restricted Securities for whose benefit such Registration Statement is being
prepared.

SECTION 8. _Indemnification_. __

 

(a) The Issuers and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree to
indemnify and hold harmless (i) each Holder and (ii) each Person, if any, who
controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act) any Holder (any of the Persons referred to in this clause
(ii) being hereinafter referred to as a " __ _controlling person_ __") and
(iii) the respective officers, directors, partners, employees,
representatives and agents of any Holder or any controlling person (any Person
referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) may hereinafter

 



-17-  be referred to as an " _Indemnified Holder_ "), to the fullest extent
lawful, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions in respect thereof) including, without limitation, and as
incurred, reimbursement of each such Indemnified Holder for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or
defending any such loss, claim damage, liability or action, joint or several,
directly or indirectly arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration
Statement or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein (in the case of the Registration Statement or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or necessary to make the statements therein (with respect
to the Prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made)
not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
actions are caused by an untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue
statement or omission that is made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information relating to any of the Holders furnished in writing to the Issuers
by any of the Holders expressly for use therein. This indemnity agreement
shall be in addition to any liability which the Issuers or any of the
Guarantors may otherwise have.

In case any action or proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory
investigation or proceeding) shall be brought or asserted against any of the
Indemnified Holders with respect to which indemnity may be sought against the
Issuers or the Guarantors, such Indemnified Holder (or the Indemnified
Holder controlled by such controlling person) shall promptly notify the
Issuers and the Guarantors in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Issuers or any of the
Guarantors of their respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Such
Indemnified Holder shall have the right to employ its own counsel in any such
action and the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid, as incurred,
by the Issuers and the Guarantors (regardless of whether it is ultimately
determined that an Indemnified Holder is not entitled to indemnification
hereunder). The Issuers and the Guarantors shall not, in connection with any
one such action or proceeding or separate but substantially similar
or related actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction arising out of the
same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the reasonable fees
and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any
local counsel) at any time for such Indemnified Holders, which firm shall be
reasonably designated by the Holders. The Issuers and the Guarantors shall not
be liable to any indemnified party for any settlement or compromise or consent
to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim,
action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution
may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or
potential parties to such claim, action, suit or proceeding) unless such
settlement, compromise or consent is consented to by the Issuers and the
Guarantors in writing. The Issuers and the Guarantors shall not, without the
prior written consent of each Indemnified Holder, settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any pending
or threatened action, claim, litigation or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not
any Indemnified Holder is a party thereto), unless such settlement,
compromise, consent or termination (i) includes an unconditional release of
each Indemnified Holder from all liability arising out of such action, claim,
litigation or proceeding and (ii) does not include any statements as to or
any findings of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any
indemnified party.

 



-18- (b) Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold
harmless the Issuers, the Guarantors and their respective directors, officers
of the Issuers and the Guarantors who sign a Registration Statement, and any
Person controlling (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act) the Issuers or any of the Guarantors, and the
respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and
agents of each such Person, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from
the Issuers and the Guarantors to each of the Indemnified Holders, but only
with respect to claims and actions based on information relating to such
Holder furnished in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any
Registration Statement or Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto). In case any action or proceeding shall be brought against the
Issuers, the Guarantors or their respective directors or officers or any such
controlling person in respect of which indemnity may be sought against a
Holder of Transfer Restricted Securities, such Holder shall have the rights
and duties given the Issuers and the Guarantors, and the Issuers, the
Guarantors, their respective directors and officers and such controlling
person shall have the rights and duties given to each Holder by the preceding
paragraph. This indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that
the Holders of Transfer Restricted Securities may otherwise have.

 

(c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable
to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or (b) hereof (other than by
reason of exceptions provided in those Sections) in respect of any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or actions referred to therein, then each
applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified
party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified
party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Holders, on the other
hand, from the Initial Placement (which in the case of the Issuers and the
Guarantors shall be deemed to be equal to the total gross proceeds to the
Issuers and the Guarantors from the Initial Placement and in the case of the
Holders shall be deemed to be equal to the total discount received by such
Holder with respect to the New Securities), the amount of Additional Interest
which did not become payable as a result of the filing of the Registration
Statement resulting in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions,
and such Registration Statement, or if such allocation is not permitted by
applicable law, the relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the
one hand, and the Holders, on the other hand, in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors on the one hand and of the
Indemnified Holder on the other shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Issuers or any of the Guarantors, on the one hand,
or the Indemnified Holders, on the other hand, and the parties relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and actions referred to
above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in the
second paragraph of Section 8(a) hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses
reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or
defending any action or claim.

 



-19- The Issuers, the Guarantors and each Holder agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8(c) were determined
by pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for
such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account
of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of
the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions referred to in the
immediately preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any
such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 8, none
of the Holders (and its related Indemnified Holders) shall be required to
contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the
total discount received by such Holder with respect to the New
Securities exceeds the amount of any damages which such Holder has otherwise
been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The Holders obligations to contribute pursuant to this
Section 8(c) are several in proportion to the respective principal amount of
New Securities held by each of the Holders hereunder and not joint.

SECTION 9. _Rule 144A. _Each of the Issuers and the Guarantors
hereby agrees with each Holder, for so long as any Transfer Restricted
Securities remain outstanding, if the Partnership is no longer required to
file reports under the Exchange Act, to make available upon request to any
Holder or beneficial owner of Transfer Restricted Securities in connection
with any sale thereof and any prospective purchaser of such Transfer
Restricted Securities from such Holder or beneficial owner, the information
required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in order to permit
resales of such Transfer Restricted Securities pursuant to Rule 144A under the
Securities Act.

 

SECTION 10. _Participation in Underwritten Registrations. _No Holder
may participate in any Underwritten Registration hereunder unless such Holder
(a) agrees to sell such Holders Transfer Restricted Securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled
hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes all
reasonable questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting
agreements, lock-up letters and other documents required under the terms of
such underwriting arrangements.

 

SECTION 11. _Selection of Underwriters. _The Holders of Transfer
Restricted Securities covered by the Shelf Registration Statement who desire
to do so may sell such Transfer Restricted Securities in an Underwritten
Offering. In any such Underwritten Offering, the investment bankers and
managing underwriter(s) that will administer such offering will be selected
by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Transfer
Restricted Securities included in such offering; _provided, however_ , that
such investment banker(s) and managing underwriters must be reasonably
satisfactory to the Issuers.

 



-20- SECTION 12. _Miscellaneous_.

 

(a) _Remedies. _Each of the Issuers and the Guarantors hereby agrees
that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss
incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and
hereby agree to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that
a remedy at law would be adequate.

 

(b) _No Inconsistent Agreements. _Each of the Issuers and the
Guarantors will not on or after the date of this Agreement enter into any
agreement with respect to its securities that is inconsistent with the rights
granted to the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the
provisions hereof. The rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in any
way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the
holders of the Issuers or any of the Guarantors securities under any
agreement in effect on the date hereof.

 

(c) _Adjustments Affecting the Securities_. The Issuers will not take
any action, or permit any change to occur, with respect to the New Securities
that would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Holders to
Consummate any Exchange Offer.

 

(d) _Amendments and Waivers_. The provisions of this Agreement may not
be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to or
departures from the provisions hereof may not be given unless the Issuers have
(i) in the case of Section 5 hereof and this Section 12(d)(i), obtained the
written consent of Holders of all outstanding Transfer Restricted Securities
and (ii) in the case of all other provisions hereof, obtained the written
consent of Holders of a majority of the outstanding principal amount of
Transfer Restricted Securities (excluding any Transfer Restricted Securities
held by the Issuers or its Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
waiver or consent to departure from the provisions hereof that relates
exclusively to the rights of Holders whose securities are being
tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer and that does not affect directly or
indirectly the rights of other Holders whose securities are not being tendered
pursuant to such Exchange Offer may be given by the Holders of a majority of
the outstanding principal amount of Transfer Restricted Securities being
tendered or registered; _provided, however_ , that, with respect to any matter
that directly or indirectly affects the rights of any Initial Purchaser
hereunder, the Issuers shall obtain the written consent of Wells Fargo
Securities LLC, as representative of the Initial Purchasers, with respect to
which such amendment, qualification, supplement, waiver, consent or departure
is to be effective.

 

(e) _Notices_. All notices and other communications provided for or

 _Resale Pursuant to Regulation S or Rule 144A_. Each Initial Purchaser
understands that:

 

Such Initial Purchaser agrees that it has not offered or sold and will not
offer or sell the Securities in the United States or to, or for the benefit
or account of, a U.S. Person (other than a distributor), in each case, as
defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S (i) as part of its distribution at any
time and (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of
the offering of the Securities pursuant hereto and the Closing Date, other
than in accordance with Regulation S or another exemption from the
registration requirements of the 1933 Act. The Initial Purchaser agrees that,
during such 40-day restricted period, it will not cause any advertisement
with respect to the Securities (including any "tombstone" advertisement) to be
published in any newspaper or periodical or posted in any public place and
will not issue any circular relating to the Securities, except such
advertisements as are permitted by and include the statements required by
Regulation S.

Such Initial Purchaser agrees that, at or prior to confirmation of a sale of
Securities by it to any distributor, dealer or person receiving a selling
concession, fee or other remuneration during the 40-day restricted period
referred to in Rule 903 of Regulation S, it will send to such distributor,
dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration a
confirmation or notice to substantially the following effect:

 

"The Securities covered hereby have not been registered under the U.S.
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and may not be
offered and sold within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit
of, U.S. persons (i) as part of your distribution at any time or (ii)
otherwise until 40 days after the later of the date the Securities were first
offered to persons other than distributors in reliance on Regulation S and the
Closing Date, except in either case in accordance with Regulation S under the
Securities Act (or in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act or
to accredited investors in transactions that are exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act), and in connection with any subsequent
sale by you of the Securities covered hereby in reliance on Regulation S under
the Securities Act during the period referred to above to any distributor,
dealer or person receiving a selling concession, fee or other remuneration,
you must deliver a notice to substantially the foregoing effect. Terms used
above have the meanings assigned to them in Regulation S under the Securities
Act."

Such Initial Purchaser agrees that the Securities offered and sold
in reliance on Regulation S will be represented upon issuance by a global
security that may not be exchanged for definitive securities until the
expiration of the 40-day restricted period referred to in Rule 903 of
