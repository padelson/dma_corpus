indemnify and hold the Seller and its affiliates, subsidiaries, parent
companies, directors, officers, agents and employees harmless (subject to the

any warranty, representation or covenant on the part of the Purchaser made
herein, and (ii) the Assumed Liabilities.

  



  

5.3  _Indemnification by the Seller._ The Seller hereby agrees to indemnify
and hold the Company, the Purchaser and their respective affiliates,
subsidiaries, parent companies, directors, officers, agents and employees
harmless (subject to the terms of this Article 5) from and against any and

(a) Upon receipt by one party of notice of any claim by a third party which
might give rise to indemnification hereunder, or upon such party's discovery
of facts which might give rise to indemnification hereunder including with
respect to any breach of any of Purchaser's representation or warranties,
covenants or agreements in this Agreement, the party claiming
indemnification hereunder (the " _Indemnitee "_) shall give prompt written
notice to the other (the " _Indemnitor_ "), which notice shall describe in
reasonable detail the Damages anticipated to be suffered (if ascertainable)
and the specific circumstances thereof, and specifying the provisions of this
Agreement to which such claim for Damages relates (the " _Damage Claim Notice_
"). The Indemnitee may amend the Damage Claim Notice, without prejudice to
its rights hereunder, if it becomes aware of facts indicating that the
Damages anticipated to be suffered have increased or decreased from those
estimated in the previous Damage Claim Notice. A failure to provide or amend
the Damage Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor from any obligations
or liabilities that the Indemnitor may have to the Indemnitee hereunder,
except to the extent that the Indemnitor has been adversely prejudiced as a
result of such failure. The Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of any such claim or action which is a third party claim or action at
the Indemnitor's own cost and, upon the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to
assume the defense thereof, with counsel of Indemnitor's own choosing, the
cost of which shall be paid for by the Indemnitor. Upon notice from Indemnitor
to Indemnitee of Indemnitor's election to assume the defense, the Indemnitor
will not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense
thereof. The Indemnitee may not compromise or settle any claim for which it
has asserted or may assert its right to indemnification without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The Indemnitor may not compromise or settle any claim for
which Indemnitor has elected to assume the defense without Indemnitee's prior
written consent, unless (i) Indemnitor has acknowledged its obligation to pay
all Damages relating to such claim and has provided to Indemnitee evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitee that Indemnitor has the financial
wherewithal to pay such Damages, (ii) such settlement will not contain any
terms that would interfere in the normal operations of the Indemnitee, and
(iii) such settlement contains an unconditional release of all claims against
the Indemnitee.

(b) Upon receipt by Indemnitor of a Damage Claim Notice which does not relate
to a third party claim, the Indemnitor and Indemnitee shall make all
reasonable efforts to promptly resolve such claim on an amicable basis within
the thirty (30) day period following such receipt. If not resolved, then the
issues will be exclusively resolved by binding arbitration by the American
Arbitration Association in New York, New York, upon a party's submission of
the dispute to arbitration. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a
reasonable time after the claim, dispute or other matter in question has
arisen, and in no event shall it be made after two years from when the
aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim, dispute
or breach. The complaining party shall notify the other party in writing
thereof.

  



  

(c) The arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator. If the parties
are not able to agree upon the selection of an arbitrator, within 20 days of
commencement of an arbitration proceeding by service of a demand for
arbitration, the arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration
Association. The arbitrator so elected shall have at least five (5) years'
experience in resolving commercial disputes involving indemnification claims
similar to those under this Agreement. The arbitrator shall permit
reasonable document discovery and deposition of witnesses. The decision of
the arbitrator shall be rendered as promptly as is feasible, and shall be
final and binding on the parties. The costs and expenses of the arbitration,
including the arbitrator's fees, shall be shared equally by the parties.

  



  

5.5  _Payment of Indemnification Obligations_. Damages shall be due and owing
when finally judicially determined to be covered by the indemnities set forth
in Article 5 hereof or otherwise as mutually agreed among the parties hereto.
The Indemnitor shall, within ten (10) business days following receipt of
written demand by the Indemnitee, pay the Indemnitee or at the
Indemnitee's direction in immediately available funds any and all Damages
then due and owing.

  



  

5.6  _Agreements Regarding Representations_. It is understood that the Seller
is not making any representations or warranties except as expressly set forth
in Article 3 hereof and the Purchaser is not making any representations or
warranties except as expressly set forth in Article 4 hereof. The
representations and warranties of any party (a " _Representing Party_
") shall not be affected or deemed waived by reason of any investigation made
(or not made) by or on behalf of the other party, or by reason of the fact
that the other party knew or should have known that any such representation or
warranty is or might be inaccurate or untrue. Each Representing Party hereby
acknowledges that, regardless of any investigation made (or not made) by or on
behalf of the other party, and regardless of the results of any such
investigation, the other party has entered into this transaction in express
reliance upon the representations and warranties of the Representing Party
made herein. The Representing Party further acknowledges that, in connection
with this transaction, the other party has furnished to the Representing Party

representations and warranties made herein.
