ARTICLE II 

 

 

THE MERGER

 

 

Section 2.1 The Closing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place
at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, as soon as practicable (and, in any
event, within one (1) Business Day) after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in
Article IX (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted
hereunder) of such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated
pursuant to its terms or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing
by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Heller,
Ehrman LLP, 275 Middlefield Road, Menlo Park, California 94025, unless
another place is agreed to by the parties hereto.

 

 

Section 2.2 The Merger.

 

 

(a) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger Sub
shall file a certificate of merger (the "Merger Certificate") with the
Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required
by Delaware Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time (the "Effective Time") as the Merger Certificate is
duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State or at such later time as is
specified in the Merger Certificate.

 

 

(b) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges
and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities,
restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided
under Delaware Law.

 

 

Section 2.3 Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

 

 

(a) except as otherwise provided in Sections 2.3(b), 2.3(c) or 2.5, each
Company Share or Company Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive $2.70 in
cash, without interest (the "Merger Consideration");

 

 

(b) each Company Share or Company Restricted Share held by the Company as
treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect
thereto;

 

 

(c) each Company Share held by any Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent
(other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into such number of shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Surviving Corporation such that each such Subsidiary owns the same percentage
of Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such
Subsidiary owned in the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

 

 

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same
rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and (in addition to
shares referred to in Section 2.3(c)) shall constitute the only outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

Section 2.4 Surrender and Payment.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose
of exchanging for the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing
Company Shares (the "Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated Company Shares
(the "Uncertificated Shares"). Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall pay to the Exchange Agent, the Merger Consideration to be paid
in respect of the Certificates and the Uncertificated Shares. Promptly after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after
the Effective Time), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each record holder of Company Shares or Company Restricted Shares at
the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the
Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

 

 

(b) Each holder of Company Shares or Company Restricted Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common
Stock represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i)
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly
completed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the
Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the case
may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent after
the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

 

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the
transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share
shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment
shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a
result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the
Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11  

 

 

 

 

 


 

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Shares or Company Restricted Shares. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,
in this Article II.

 

 

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration paid to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.4(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon)
that remains unclaimed by holders of Company Shares or Company Restricted
Shares six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent,
upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged such Company Shares or
Company Restricted Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this Section 2.4 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such Company Shares or
Company Restricted Shares without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares or
Company Restricted Shares for any amounts paid to a public official pursuant
to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

 

 

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration paid to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.4(a) in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.

 

 

Section 2.5 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.3, any Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the
"Dissenting Shares") held by a holder who has not voted in favor of adoption
of this Agreement or the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
demanded appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with Delaware Law
shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration,
unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right
to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or loses the right to appraisal, such Company Shares shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right
to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Company
Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), the Company shall not make any payment with respect
to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 

 

Section 2.6 Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Shares.

 

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
or payment being required on the part of the holders thereof, each option to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Company Stock Option")
issued under any stock option stock or equity compensation plan or agreement
(the "Company Stock Plans") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be deemed to
be one hundred percent (100%) vested and exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time, cancelled and, in consideration of such cancellation, Parent
shall, or shall cause Surviving Corporation to, promptly following the
Effective Time, pay to such holders of Company Stock Options an amount in
respect thereof equal to the product of (i) the excess, if

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 


 

any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price of each such Company
Stock Option and (ii) the number of unexercised Company Shares subject
thereto (such payment, if any, to be net of applicable Taxes withheld
pursuant to Section 2.7). In the case of any issued Company Stock Option for
which the per share exercise price is greater than or equal to the
Merger Consideration, the amount to which the holder of such Company Stock
Option shall be entitled at the Effective Time shall be $0.00 and, for the
avoidance of doubt, such Company Stock Option shall be terminated for
no consideration. As of the Effective Time, the Company Stock Plans shall
terminate and all rights under any provision of any other plan, program
or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in
respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall
be cancelled. The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to effectuate the
foregoing, including, but not limited to, sending out the requisite
notices and obtaining all consents necessary to cash out and cancel all
Company Stock Options necessary to ensure that, after the Effective Time, no
person shall have any right under the Company Stock Plans, except as set
forth herein.

 

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
or payment being required on the part of the holders thereof, each Company
Restricted Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be, whether or not then vested, deemed to be one hundred percent (100%)
vested immediately prior to the Effective Time and converted into the right
to receive Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.4.

 

 

Section 2.7 Withholding Rights. Each of the Company, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold in
respect of any payments made hereunder as may be required by applicable
Tax law. If the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect
of which the Company, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the
case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

 

Section 2.8 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated under this Article II.

 

 

 

ARTICLE III

 

 

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

 

 

Section 3.1 Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall
be amended and restated in its entirety so that such certificate of
incorporation is identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (i)

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

13  

 

 

 

 

 


 

the name of the corporation set forth therein shall be changed to the name of
the Company and (ii) the identity of the sole incorporator shall be deleted.

 

 

Section 3.2 Bylaws. The bylaws of Merger Sub in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
amended in accordance with Applicable Law.

 

 

Section 3.3 Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time,
except as otherwise duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii)
the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

 

 

 

ARTICLE IV

Section 4.1 Corporate Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware and has all corporate powers required to carry on its
business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business and
is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification is

committees of the Company Board, all codes of conduct, whistleblower policies
or similar policies adopted by the Company Board. The Company has made
available to Parent a true and correct copy of the Company Certificate of

"Company Charter Documents"). Each such instrument is in full force
and effect. The Company is not in violation of any of the provisions of the
Company Charter Documents.

 

 

Section 4.2 Corporate Authorization.

 

 

(a) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
are within the Company's corporate powers and, except for obtaining the
Stockholder Approval have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the
approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger (the
"Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of the holders of any of the
Company's capital stock necessary in connection with the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 


 

Agreement. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium
and other similar Applicable Law affecting creditors' rights generally and by
general principles of equity.

 

 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, the Company's Board of Directors duly adopted resolutions by a
unanimous vote of those directors in attendance (i) declaring that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby are fair to and in the
best interests of the Company's stockholders, (ii) approving and declaring
advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) directing that the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger be
submitted to the Stockholder Meeting and (iv) making the Board
Recommendation.

 

 

Section 4.3 Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the
filing of the Merger Certificate with the Delaware Secretary of State and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other states in which
the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any applicable
requirements of the HSR Act and any Applicable Law analogous to the HSR Act
or otherwise regulating antitrust, competition or merger control matters and
in each case existing in foreign jurisdictions ("Foreign Competition Laws"),

Act and any other applicable U.S. state or federal securities laws, (iv)
compliance with the Exon-Florio Amendment of the Defense Production Act of
1950, as amended ("Exon-Florio") and any similar or analogous Applicable Law
including the making of a Joint Filing (as that term is defined in
Section 8.1(e) hereof), (v) the contractual consents set forth on Section 4.3
of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (vi) any actions or filings the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

 

 

Section 4.4 Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not and will not (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the Company Charter Documents, (ii) assuming compliance with the

the advice of outside counsel, result in a waiver of attorney-client

the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

 

 

(iv) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would reasonably be
expected to cause the conditions set forth in Section 9.3(a) or Section
9.3(d) not to be satisfied; and

 

 

(v) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant
contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that would

by Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the

effective on the Closing Date. The Company shall provide Parent evidence that
such resolutions to terminate the Company 401(k) plan have been adopted by
the Company Board or the board of directors of its Subsidiaries, as
applicable. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
review and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be

certification to that effect dated not more than thirty (30) days prior to
the Effective Time.

 

 

Section 6.9 Director Resignations. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain a written letter of resignation from each of the
directors of the Company, and each of its Subsidiaries that will be effective
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, that such

its Subsidiaries.

 

 

 

ARTICLE VII

 

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT

 

 

Parent agrees that:

 

 

Section 7.1 Director and Officer Liability.

 

 

(a) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Person") as provided
in the Company Charter Documents (or comparable organizational documents as
in effect on the date of this Agreement) and any indemnification or other
agreements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date
hereof (the "Indemnification Agreements") shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms, and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to, comply with and honor the foregoing obligations. Without limiting the
generality or effect of the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all
respect the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Indemnified Persons pursuant to (x) any Indemnification Agreement and (y)
indemnification, expense advancement and exculpation provisions set forth in
the Company Charter Documents or other charter or organizational documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each instance as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and subject to Applicable Law.

 

 

(b)  Prior to the Effective time, the Company shall purchase a director and
officer "tail" policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time covering each Indemnified Person currently covered by the
Company's officers' and directors'

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 


 

liability insurance policy for six (6) years after the Effective Time on
terms with respect to coverage and amount not to exceed the amount set forth
in Section 7.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and with an aggregate
premium not to exceed three hundred percent (300%) of the amount per annum
the Company paid in respect of its last annual policy period.

 

 

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.1 as applicable.

 

 

(d) The rights of each Indemnified Person under this Section 7.1 shall
survive consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person. The obligations of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.1 shall not be terminated or
modified in such manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Person to whom
this Section 7.1 applies, without the consent of such Indemnified Person.

 

 

Section 7.2 Employee Matters.

 

 

(a) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, for those employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who continue as employees of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (the "Continuing Employees"), (i) through December 31,
2008, compensation (including base salary and bonus) that shall not be any
less favorable than the compensation and benefits provided by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
date of the Agreement and (ii) through December 31, 2009, employee benefits
that in the aggregate are not less favorable than the benefits provided by
the Company or the applicable Subsidiary to the Continuing Employees
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. Nothing herein shall be
deemed to be a guarantee of employment following the Closing Date for any
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than as provided in
any applicable employment agreement or other Contract.

 

 

(b) Parent shall (i) waive, or shall cause to be waived, any applicable pre-
existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor
welfare benefit plan of the Company or any Subsidiary that a Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate in following the Closing to the extent
such exclusions or waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been
satisfied by, such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing under
the analogous Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated, (ii) provide, or cause to be provided, each Continuing Employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing (to
the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company Employee
Plan prior to the Closing) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements and (iii) recognize service prior to the Closing with the
Company and any of its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility to
participate, vesting, determination of level of benefits, and vacation
accrual to the same extent such service was recognized by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries under the

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 


 

analogous Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing; provided, that the
foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in any duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.

 

 

(c) From and after the Closing, except as otherwise agreed in writing between
Parent and a Company employee, and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, including Section 7.2(a) above, Parent shall honor and shall
cause to be honored, in accordance with its terms, (i) each existing
employment, change in control, severance, or other termination protection
plan, policy or practice of or between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
and any officer, director or employee, including, but not limited to, the
Company's standard severance practice of one (1) week of severance for each
year (including partial years) of employment for employees not subject to a
severance agreement or other termination protection provisions contained in
any Contract and who are terminated without cause (with a minimum of three
months of severance for vice president-level employees, two months
of severance for director-level employees and one month of severance for all
other employees), (ii) all obligations in effect as of the Closing under
any bonus or bonus deferral plans, programs or agreements of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) all obligations in effect as of the Closing
pursuant to any retention and equity-based plans, programs or agreements, and
all vested and accrued benefits under any Company Employee Plan, in each
case, provided that such arrangement or obligation has been disclosed to
Parent in Section 4.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule as of the date
hereof, and the Company has provided to Parent a complete and accurate copy
of the applicable Company Employee Plan.

 

 

 

ARTICLE VIII

 

 

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND THE COMPANY

 

 

The parties hereto agree that:

 

 

Section 8.1 Reasonable Best Efforts.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective commercially reasonable best efforts to (x) take, or cause to be
taken, actions, and (y) do, or cause to be done, things necessary, proper or
advisable under any Applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including using commercially reasonable best efforts in (i) the preparation
and filing of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) obtaining
(and cooperating with each other in obtaining) any consent, authorization,
Order or approval of, or any exemption by, any Third Party, including any
Governmental Authority (which actions shall include furnishing all
information required under the HSR Act and in connection with approvals of or
filings with any other Governmental Authority) required to be obtained or
made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of
Parent and the Company shall use commercially

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 


 

reasonable best efforts not to take any action after the date of this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to materially delay the obtaining
of, or result in not obtaining, any permission, approval or consent from any
Governmental Authority necessary to be obtained prior to Closing.

 

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other
parties to this Agreement to provide any necessary information with respect
to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their
counsel) copies of), all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Authority or any other information supplied by such party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party to
this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this Agreement of
any communication from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any party to this Agreement
or any Affiliate of such party receives a request for additional information
or documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall
use commercially reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made,
promptly and after consultation with the other parties to this Agreement, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request.

 

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to
file, as promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, notifications under the HSR
Act and shall use reasonable best efforts to respond, as promptly as
practicable, to any inquiries received from the Federal Trade Commission and
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice for additional
information or documentation and to respond, as promptly as practicable, to
all inquiries and requests received from any state Attorney General or other
Governmental Authority in connection with antitrust matters.

 

 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable best
efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United
States federal or state laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade (collectively, "Antitrust Laws"). Each of Parent and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to take such action as may be required to
cause the expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other
Antitrust Laws with respect to the Transactions as promptly as possible after
the execution of this Agreement.

 

 

(e) Company and Parent shall cooperate with respect to the preparation and
submission as promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
of a joint filing and any requested supplemental information (collectively,
the "Joint Filing") to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States (including any successor or replacement, "CFIUS") under Exon-Florio
with regard to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties
shall promptly provide each other with all information necessary to complete
preparation and submission of the Joint Filing, to respond to any inquiries
from CFIUS or any other interested Governmental Authority and use
commercially reasonable best efforts to take all

 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 


 

steps necessary to secure the approval of CFIUS of the transactions
contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable ("CFIUS Approval"). Without
limiting the foregoing, the requirement of Parent to use its commercially
reasonable best efforts to obtain the CFIUS Approval shall include
negotiating and entering into one or more mitigation agreements with a
federal Governmental Authority, provided that such mitigation agreements
would not result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this
Agreement shall require Parent or any of its Affiliates to (i) litigate with
any Governmental Authority, (ii) divest any material business or assets or
any of the shares of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) divest,
hold separate or otherwise accept limitations on ownership or control by
Parent or any of its Affiliates of any of their respective existing

Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company) or (iv) agree that a
majority of the directors of Parent, any of its Affiliates or of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries be residents or citizens of the United States.

 

 

Section 8.2 Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release, making any other public
statement, or scheduling any press conference or conference call with
investors or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and, except as may be required by Applicable Law or any
listing agreement with or rule of any national securities exchange or
association, shall not issue any such press release, make any such other
public statement, or schedule any such press conference or conference call
before such consultation.

 

 

Section 8.3 Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

be available to any party whose willful failure to fulfill any
material obligation under this Agreement has been a principal cause of the
failure of the Merger to occur on or before the End Date;

 

 

(c) by either Parent or the Company if a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction shall have issued a nonappealable final Order, decree
or ruling or taken any other nonappealable final action, in each case having

52  

 

 

 

 

 


 

failure to fulfill any material obligation under this Agreement has been the
principal cause of the failure to obtain Stockholder Approval;

 

 

(e) by the Company, upon an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Superior Proposal effected by the Company Board in compliance with Section
6.4 and concurrently with payment to Parent by the Company of all amounts due
pursuant to Section 11.4 of this Agreement in accordance with the terms
specified therein;

 

 

(f) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the

the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(f), or (ii)
a tender or exchange offer for all of the Company's outstanding
securities shall have been formally commenced by a Third Party, and the

(g) by Parent, if there has been a breach of or failure to perform any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company

any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform

be satisfied, and (ii) (A) shall not have been cured within twenty (20)
Business Days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or
failure to perform from the Company or (B) by its nature or timing cannot

Section 11.2 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time. The covenants
of Parent and Surviving Corporation in this Agreement shall survive the
Effective Time.

 

 

Section 11.3 Amendments and Waivers.

 

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 7.1(d), any provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived prior to the Effective Time if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment,
by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party
against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, that after
the Stockholder Approval without the further approval of the Company's
stockholders, no such amendment or waiver shall be made or given that
requires the approval of the stockholders of the Company under Delaware Law
unless the required approval is obtained.

 

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

 

 

Section 11.4 Expenses.

 

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense; provided, that the Company and Parent shall share equally all
filing fees payable pursuant to a CFIUS review, the HSR Act or any Foreign
Competition Law.

 

 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(d) or Section
10.1(f) and after the date of this Agreement but prior to such termination
(i) an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly disclosed and not publicly
withdrawn and (ii) within twelve (12) months of such termination the Company
shall have entered into any binding, definitive written Contract for any
Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by Parent), within
one (1) Business Day of the execution of such Contract, a fee in an amount
equal to $4,500,000 (the "Breakup Fee"). For purposes of this Section 11.4,
each reference to fifteen percent (15%) or eighty-five percent (85%),
respectively, in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to
be fifty percent (50%).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(e), then the
Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent), within one (1) Business Day of
such termination by Parent, the Breakup Fee.

 

 

(d)  In no event shall the Company have to pay more than one Breakup Fee.
Except as provided in Section 10.2 hereof, payment of the Breakup Fee shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates

(e) The Company acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in Section
11.4(b) and Section 11.4(c) are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the amount of, and the basis for payment
of, the Breakup Fee is reasonable and appropriate in all respects, and (iii)
without this agreement, Parent would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner the Breakup Fee
pursuant to Section 11.4(b) and / or Section 11.4(c), and, in order to
obtain such payment, Parent makes a claim that results in a judgment for
the Breakup Fee, the Company shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection
with such suit, together with interest on the amount set forth in Section
11.4(b) and / or Section 11.4(c) at the prime lending rate as reported in
The Wall Street Journal, plus two percent (2%), on the date such Breakup Fee
was required to be paid hereunder.

 

 

Section 11.5 Disclosure Schedule References. The parties hereto agree that
any reference in a particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule

for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the Company that are contained in the corresponding Section of
this Agreement and (ii) any other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in this
Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception to (or
a disclosure for purposes of) such representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) are reasonably apparent.

provided in Section 7.1, shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in Section

or obligations under this Agreement without the consent of each other party
hereto, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights
and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part,
to one or more of its Affiliates at any time; provided, that such transfer
or assignment shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its
obligations hereunder.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56

any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.

parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the

invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions

This Agreement of Guarantee (this "Agreement") dated June 5, 2008 between

VOTING AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY

 

 

This VOTING AGREEMENT AND IRREVOCABLE PROXY (this "Agreement") is entered
into effective as of June 5, 2008, by and between Axway Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and the undersigned stockholders (collectively
referred to herein as "Stockholder") of Tumbleweed Communications Corp., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings ascribed to them
in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

 

 

RECITALS

 

 

WHEREAS, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Stockholder is a
material inducement to the willingness of Parent to enter into that certain
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated on or about the date hereof (the
"Merger Agreement"), by and among Parent, Tornado Acquisition Corp., a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"),
and the Company, pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company (the "Merger"), and the Company will survive the Merger and become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

 

 

WHEREAS, Stockholder understands and acknowledges that the Company and Parent
are entitled to rely on: (i) the truth and accuracy of Stockholder's
representations contained herein; and (ii) Stockholder's performance of the
obligations set forth herein.

 

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the covenants and
agreements set forth in the Merger Agreement and in this Agreement, and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

 

 

1. Restrictions on Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions herein and in the Merger Agreement:

 

 

(a) Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer (except as may be
specifically required by court order or by operation of law), grant an option
with respect to, sell, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of, or encumber,
the Shares (as defined in Section 4(a) below) or any New Shares (as defined
in Section 1(d) below), or make any offer or enter into any agreement or
binding arrangement or commitment or other Contract providing for any of the
foregoing, at any time prior to the Expiration Time (as defined below);
provided, however, that nothing contained herein will be deemed to restrict
the ability of Stockholder to exercise any Company Options held by
Stockholder; provided, further, that Stockholder may transfer Shares and New
Shares: (i) to any member of Stockholder's immediate family; (ii) to a trust
for the benefit of Stockholder or any member of Stockholder's immediate
family for estate planning purposes; (iii) in connection with or for the
purpose of personal tax-planning; or (iv) to a charitable organization
qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended; provided, however, that any transfer referred to in this section
shall be permitted

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

only if, as a precondition to such transfer, the transferee agrees to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided further
however, that Stockholder may sell up to 60,000 Shares or New Shares in
accordance with Stockholder's Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan as in effect as of
January 1, 2008, a copy of which has previously been provided to Parent. As
used herein, the term "Expiration Time" shall mean the earliest to occur of:
(A) the Effective Time; (B) the valid termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with its terms; (C) the written agreement of the parties hereto to
terminate this Agreement; or (D) the date of: (1) any change or amendment to
the material terms of the Merger Agreement (including a waiver or forbearance
by the parties to the Merger Agreement that has the effect of a change or
amendment) that adversely effects the Stockholder or the Stockholder's
interest in the Shares or New Shares (excluding, for sake of clarity, any
amendment to the terms of the Merger Agreement with the effect of extending
the End Date); or (2) any change or amendment of the Merger Agreement
(including a waiver or forbearance by the parties to the Merger Agreement
that has the effect of a change or amendment) that results in a decrease in
the Merger Consideration or that results in a change in the form of
consideration to be paid by Parent in the Merger.

 

 

(b) At all times commencing with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
until the Expiration Time, Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly,
grant any proxies or powers of attorney with respect to any of the Shares or
any New Shares, deposit any of the Shares or any New Shares into a voting
trust, or enter into a voting agreement (other than this Agreement) or
similar binding arrangement or commitment with respect to any of the Shares
or any New Shares, in each case in a manner which is inconsistent with the
terms hereof.

 

 

(c) Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action (other
than any action of Stockholder in the exercise of Stockholder's fiduciary or
other duties to the Company and its Stockholders, to the extent any such
duties shall exist), between the date hereof and the Expiration Time, that
would make any representation or warranty contained herein untrue or
incorrect or have the effect of impairing Stockholder from performing his or
her obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

(d) Any shares of Company Common Stock or other voting securities of the
Company that Stockholder purchases or with respect to which Stockholder
otherwise acquires or exercises voting rights after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Expiration Time, including pursuant to the
exercise of Company Options and Other Rights (as defined in the Section
4(b) below) (collectively, the "New Shares") shall be subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement to the same extent as if they constituted
Shares.

 

 

2. Agreement to Vote Shares.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Expiration Time and except as otherwise contemplated by
Section 2(b) below, at every meeting of the Stockholders of the Company
called and at every adjournment or postponement thereof, and in any written
action by consent of Stockholders of the Company, unless otherwise directed
in writing by Parent, Stockholder shall vote, to the extent not voted by the
person(s) appointed pursuant to Section 3 of this Agreement, the Shares

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

and any New Shares: (i) in favor of approval of the principal terms of the
Merger and any matter that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the
Merger; and (ii) against any Acquisition Proposal and any other action that
would reasonably be expected to frustrate, delay, postpone, prevent or
adversely affect the Merger.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or
restrict Stockholder from: (i) acting in Stockholder's capacity as a director
or officer of the Company, to the extent applicable, it being understood that
this Agreement shall apply to Stockholder solely in Stockholder's capacity as
a Stockholder of the Company; or (ii) voting in Stockholder's sole discretion
on any matter other than matters referred to in Section 2(a).

 

 

3. Grant of Irrevocable Proxy. In order to secure the performance by Stockholder of Stockholder's obligations under this Agreement, until the Expiration Time, Stockholder hereby irrevocably (or to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws) appoints the Board of Directors of Parent or any other designee of Parent, as Stockholder's sole and exclusive attorneys-in-fact and proxies, with full power of substitution and resubstitution, to vote and exercise all voting and related rights (to the fullest extent Stockholder is entitled to do so) with respect to the Shares and any New Shares in accordance with Section 2 of this Agreement, but subject to the terms of Section 2(b). The proxies and powers of attorney granted pursuant to this Section 3 by Stockholder shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable proxy and shall terminate upon the Expiration Time. Stockholder hereby revokes any and all prior proxies or powers of attorney given by the Stockholder with respect to the voting of any Shares or any New Shares inconsistent with the terms of Section 2 and agrees not to grant any subsequent proxies or powers of attorney with respect to the voting of any Shares or any New Shares inconsistent with the terms of Section 2 until after the Expiration Time.

 

 

4. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Stockholder. Stockholder hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Parent as follows as of the date hereof:

 

 

(a) Stockholder is the beneficial or record owner of, and has the voting
power over, that number of shares of Company Common Stock and restricted
shares of Company Common Stock set forth on the signature page hereto (all
such shares owned beneficially or of record by Stockholder, or over which
Stockholder exercises voting power, on the date hereof, collectively, the
"Shares" provided that any Shares subsequently transferred as permitted in
and accordance with Section 1(a) above shall from and after such transfer
cease to be Shares). The Shares are free of any encumbrance that would
materially and adversely affect Stockholder's ability to exercise his or her
voting power as provided in Section 2, grant the proxy pursuant to Section
3, or otherwise complying with the terms hereof. No person not a
signatory to this Agreement has a beneficial interest in or a right to
acquire or vote any of the Shares (other than, if Stockholder is a married
individual and resides in a state with community property laws, the community
property interest of his or her spouse to the extent applicable under such
community property laws). The Shares constitute Stockholder's entire interest
in the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and Stockholder is not the
beneficial or record holder of, and does not

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exercise voting power over, any other outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company. No person that is not a signatory to this Agreement has
a beneficial interest in or a right to acquire or vote any of the Shares.

 

 

(b) Stockholder is the legal and beneficial owner of the number of options to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock set forth on the signature page
hereto (collectively, the "Company Options and Other Rights"). The Company
Options and Other Rights are free of any encumbrance that would materially
and adversely affect Stockholder's ability to exercise his or her voting
powers as provided in Section 2, grant the proxy pursuant to Section 3,
or otherwise comply with the terms hereof.

 

 

(c) Stockholder has all requisite power, capacity and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, with respect to Shares not transferred pursuant to and
accordance with Section 1(a), to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Stockholder
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
by Parent, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Stockholder,
enforceable against Stockholder in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies
generally and to general principles of equity.

 

 

(d) The execution, delivery and performance by Stockholder of this Agreement
will not: (i) conflict with, require a consent, waiver or approval under, or
result in a breach of or default under, any of the terms of any Contract
to which Stockholder is a party or by which any of such Stockholder's assets
is bound; or (ii) violate any Order or Applicable Laws applicable to
Stockholder or any of such Stockholder's assets, except for such conflicts,
breaches, violations or defaults that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, materially and adversely affect Stockholder's ability to perform
his, her or its obligations under this Agreement.

 

 

5. Consent and Waiver; Termination of Existing Agreements. Stockholder hereby agrees, between the date hereof and the Expiration Time, to give any consents or waivers that are reasonably required for the consummation of the Merger under the terms of any agreement or instrument or other Contract to which Stockholder is a party or subject or in respect of any rights Stockholder may have in connection with the Merger or the other transactions provided for in the Merger Agreement (whether such rights exist under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, any Contract to which the Company is a party or by which it is, or any of its assets are, bound under statutory or common law or otherwise). Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, Stockholder shall not, between the date hereof and the Expiration Time, contest or object to the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company actions in approving and recommending the Merger, the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions provided for in the Merger Agreement, and shall not seek damages or other legal or equitable relief in connection therewith. Unless the Expiration Time shall have occurred by reason of the occurrence of the events contemplated by clause (D) of the definition of thereof and this Agreement shall be terminated prior to the Effective Time, from and after the Effective Time, Stockholder's right to receive cash on the terms and subject to the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement shall constitute Stockholder's
sole and exclusive right against the Company and/or Parent in respect of
Stockholder's ownership of the Shares or status as a stockholder of the
Company or any agreement or instrument with the Company pertaining to the
Shares or Stockholder's status as a stockholder of the Company.

 

 

6. Confidentiality. Except as required by Applicable Laws or as otherwise permitted pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement, Stockholder shall hold any information regarding this Agreement and the Merger in strict confidence and shall not divulge any such information to any third person until Parent has publicly disclosed the Merger. Neither the Stockholder, nor any of his or her affiliates (other than the Company, whose actions shall be governed by the Merger Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement), shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public announcement with respect to this Agreement, the Merger, the Merger Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby without the prior written consent of Parent, except as may be required by Applicable Laws or by any listing agreement with, or the policies of Nasdaq in which circumstance such announcing party shall make reasonable efforts to consult with Parent to the extent practicable.

 

 

7. Dissenters' Rights. Stockholder agrees not to exercise, between the date hereof and the Expiration Time, any rights of appraisal or any dissenters' rights that Stockholder may have or could potentially have or acquire (whether under Applicable Laws or otherwise) in connection with the Merger.

(b) Interpretation. When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections,
such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. The words "include", "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date hereof", and
terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires, shall be
deemed to refer to the date first above written. Unless the context of this
Agreement otherwise requires: (i) words of any gender include each other

Agreement.

 

 

(c) Specific Performance; Injunctive Relief. The parties hereto acknowledge
that Parent will be irreparably harmed and that there will be no adequate
remedy at law for a violation of any of the covenants or agreements of
Stockholder set forth herein. Therefore, it is agreed that, in addition to
any other remedies that may be available to Parent upon any such violation of
this Agreement, Parent shall have the right to enforce such covenants and
agreements by specific performance, injunctive relief or by any other means
available to Parent at law or in equity and Stockholder hereby waives any
requirement for the security or posting of any bond in connection with
such enforcement.

(d) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts,
all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties hereto; it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart.

 

 

(e) Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest; Death
or Incapacity. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other
agreements specifically referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto
(including, without limitation, the proxy): (i) constitute an inducement and
condition to entering into the Merger Agreement; (ii) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof; and (iii)
are not intended to confer, and shall not be construed as conferring, upon
any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder.
Except as provided in Section 1(a), neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests, or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by
Stockholder without the prior written consent of Parent, and any such
assignment or delegation that is not consented to shall be null and void.
This Agreement, together with any rights, interests or obligations of Parent
hereunder, may be assigned or delegated in whole or in part by Parent to any
affiliate of Parent without the consent of or any action by Stockholder upon
notice by Parent to Stockholder as herein provided. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective permitted
successors and assigns (including, without limitation, any person to whom any
Shares are sold, transferred or assigned pursuant to Section 1(a) hereof).
All authority conferred herein shall survive the death or incapacity of the
Stockholder and in the event of Stockholder's death or incapacity, any
obligation of the Stockholder hereunder shall be binding upon the heirs,
personal representatives, successors and assigns of the Stockholder.

 

 

(f) Additional Documents. Stockholder shall, between the date hereof and
the Expiration Time, execute and deliver any additional documents necessary
or desirable, in the reasonable opinion of Parent upon advice of counsel, to
carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement.

 

 

(g) Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties hereto
further agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to replace such
void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 

 

(h) Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and
all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party shall be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
shall not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

(i) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to
such state's principles of conflicts of law. The parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State Courts
of the State of Delaware and the Federal district court of the United States
of America located within the State of Delaware, in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any Proceeding for the interpretation or enforcement hereof
or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such Proceeding may not be
brought or is not maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may
not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be
enforced in or by such courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that
all claims with respect to such Proceeding shall be heard and determined in
such a State Court in the State of Delaware or such Federal court. The
parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction over the
person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute and agree
that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
Proceeding in the manner provided in Section 8(a) or in such other manner as
may be permitted by Applicable Laws, shall be valid and sufficient service
thereof.

 

 

(j) Termination. This Agreement shall terminate and shall have no further
force or effect from and after the Expiration Time, and thereafter there
shall be no liability or obligation on the part of the Stockholder, provided,
that no such termination shall relieve any party from liability for any
breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

 

 

(k) Amendment. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if,
and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed, in the case
of an amendment, by each of the parties hereto, or in the case of a waiver,
by the party against which the waiver is to be effective. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right
hereunder.

 

 

(l) No Ownership Interest. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to vest in Parent or any of its affiliates any direct or indirect
ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares or
New Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of or relating
to the Shares and New Shares shall remain vested in and belong to
Stockholder, and Parent shall have no authority to manage, direct,
superintend, restrict, regulate, govern or administer any of the policies or
operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to Stockholder
in the voting of any of the Shares or New Shares, except as otherwise
provided herein and in the Merger Agreement.

 

 

(m) WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
