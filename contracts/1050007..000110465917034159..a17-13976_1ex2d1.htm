A. The Company Board, acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special
Committee, has unanimously (i) determined that it is in the best interests of
the Company and its stockholders to enter into this Agreement providing for

declared this Agreement advisable, in accordance with the General Corporation
Law of the State of Delaware (the " **DGCL** ") upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein; (ii) approved the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and other obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and (iii) resolved to
recommend that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement and
approve the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

B. Each of the board of managers of Parent and the board of directors of
Merger Sub have (i) declared it advisable to enter into this Agreement; and
(ii) approved the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the performance of
their respective covenants and other obligations hereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein.

 



 

C. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and
inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement, Parent
and Merger Sub have delivered (i) a limited guaranty (the " **Guaranty** ")
from HGGC Fund III, L.P., a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership (the "
**Guarantor** "), in favor of the Company and pursuant to which, subject to
the terms and conditions contained therein, the Guarantor is guaranteeing
certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub in connection with this Agreement
and (ii) a commitment letter between Parent and the Guarantor, pursuant to
which the Guarantor has committed, subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, to invest in Parent, directly or indirectly, the cash amounts set
forth therein (the " **Equity Commitment Letter** ").

 



 

D. Prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition
to the willingness of Parent and Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement,
certain stockholders of the Company have entered into a Voting Agreement in
connection with the Merger.

 



 

E. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to (i) make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger; and (ii) prescribe certain conditions with respect
to the consummation of the Merger.

      
 

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I** ** 
DEFINITIONS and INTERPRETATIONS**

 



 

1.1 _Certain Definitions_. For all purposes of and pursuant to this Agreement,
the following capitalized terms have the following respective meanings:

 



 

(a) " **Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement** " means an agreement with the
Company that is either (i) in effect as of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement; or (ii) executed, delivered and effective after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, in either case, that contains customary provisions
that require any counterparty thereto (and any of its Affiliates and
representatives named therein) that receive material non-public information of
or with respect to the Company to keep such information confidential;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case, the provisions contained therein
are no less restrictive in any material respect to such counterparty (and any
of its Affiliates and representatives named therein) than the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. If the provisions of such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement are less restrictive in the aggregate to such
counterparty (and any of its Affiliates and representatives named therein)
than the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, then, notwithstanding the
foregoing, such agreement will be deemed to be an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement if the Company offers to amend the Confidentiality Agreement so as
to make the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement as restrictive in the
aggregate as the confidentiality agreement signed by such counterparty.

 



 

(b) " **Acquisition Proposal** " means any offer or proposal (other than an
offer or proposal by Parent or Merger Sub) to engage in an Acquisition
Transaction.

 



 

(c) " **Acquisition Transaction** " means any transaction or series of related

whether from the Company or any other Person(s), of securities representing
more than 20% of the total outstanding voting power of the Company after
giving effect to the consummation of such purchase or other acquisition,
including pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by any Person or
"group" of Persons that, if consummated in accordance with its terms, would
result in such Person or "group" of Persons beneficially owning more than 20%
of the total outstanding voting power of the Company after giving effect to
the consummation of such tender or exchange offer;

 



 

(ii) any direct or indirect purchase (including by way of merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution or other transaction), license or other acquisition
by any Person or "group" (as defined pursuant to

 



      
 

 



 

Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of Persons of assets constituting or
accounting for more than 20% of the consolidated assets, revenue or net income
of the Company Group, taken as a whole (measured by the fair market value
thereof as of the date of such purchase or acquisition, as determined in good
faith by the Company Board or a committee thereof); or

 



 

(iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or other transaction involving the
Company pursuant to which any Person or "group" (as defined pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of Persons would hold securities
representing more than 20% of the total outstanding voting power of the
Company outstanding after giving effect to the consummation of such
transaction.

Antitrust Act, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act and all other
laws, whether in any domestic or foreign jurisdiction, that are designed or
intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or
effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or significant impediments or
lessening of competition or the creation or strengthening of a dominant
position through merger or acquisition, in any case that are applicable to the
Merger.

 



 

(f) " **Audited Company Balance Sheet** " means the consolidated balance sheet
(and the notes thereto) of the Company Group as of September 30, 2016 set

 **ARTICLE II** ** 
THE MERGER**

 



 

2.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, (a) Merger Sub will be merged

 



      
 

 



 

with and into the Company; (b) the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
will thereupon cease; and (c) the Company will continue as the surviving
corporation of the Merger. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the
Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the " **Surviving Corporation**."

 



 

2.2 _The Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will cause the Merger to be consummated pursuant to the DGCL by filing
a certificate of merger in customary form and substance (the " **Certificate
of Merger** ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as
may be agreed in writing by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company and specified
in the Certificate of Merger, being referred to herein as the " **Effective
Time** ").

 



 

2.3 _The Closing_. The consummation of the Merger will take place at a closing
(the " **Closing** ") to occur at (a) 9:00 a.m., Pacific time, at the offices
of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 555 California Street, San Francisco, CA 94104, on a
date to be agreed upon by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company that is no later
than the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent
permitted hereunder) of the last to be satisfied or waived of the conditions
set forth in _Article VII_ (other than those conditions that by their terms
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions); or (b) such other
time, location and date as Parent, Merger Sub and the Company mutually agree
in writing; _provided_ , _however_ , without Parents written consent, the
Closing shall not occur prior to the eighteenth (18th) Business Day following
the No-Shop Period Start Date. The date on which the Closing actually occurs
is referred to as the " **Closing Date**."

 



 

2.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
will be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto,
at the Effective Time all (a) of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving
Corporation; and (b) debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub will become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

2.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 



 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the Amended and
Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the "
**Charter** "), will be amended and restated in its entirety to read
substantially identically to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that all references
in the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub (i) to its name, date of
incorporation, registered office and registered agent shall instead refer to
the name, date of incorporation, registered office and registered agent,
respectively, of the Company as provided in the Charter immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) naming the incorporator(s), the initial board of
directors, or original subscribers for shares of Merger Sub shall be omitted)
and such amended and restated certificate of incorporation will become the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until, subject to
the provisions

 



      
 

 



 

of _Section 6.10(a)_, thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and such certificate of incorporation.

 



 

(b) _Bylaws_. The Parties shall take all necessary action such that the bylaws
of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will become
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until, subject to the provisions of
_Section 6.10(a)_, thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and such bylaws.

 



 

2.6 _Directors and Officers_.

 



 

(a) _Directors_. The Parties shall take all necessary action such that the
directors of Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be, from and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified.

 



 

(b) _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be, from and after the Effective Time, the officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed.

 



 

2.7 _Effect on Capital Stock_.

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of
the following securities, the following will occur:

 



 

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation, and thereupon each certificate representing
ownership of such shares of common stock of Merger Sub will thereafter
represent ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation;

 



 

(ii) each share of Company Common Stock that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than Owned Company Shares or Dissenting
Company Shares) will be automatically converted into the right to receive cash
in an amount equal to $41.80, without interest thereon (the " **Per Share
Price** "), and shall no longer be outstanding as set forth in _Section
2.11_; and

 



 

(iii) each share of Company Common Stock that is (A) held by the Company as
treasury stock; (B) owned by Parent or Merger Sub (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, as a result of the Voting Agreement); or (C) owned by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent or Merger Sub as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " **Owned Company
Shares** ") will be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof
or consideration paid therefor.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Adjustment to the Per Share Price_. The Per Share Price will be adjusted
appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or other distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other similar change with
respect to the Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(c) _Statutory Rights of Appraisal_.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
share of Company Common Stock that is issued and outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a Company Stockholder who shall have
neither voted in favor of the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who
shall have properly and validly exercised their statutory rights of appraisal
in respect of such share of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section
262 of the DGCL (the " **Dissenting Company Shares** ") will not be converted
into, or represent the right to receive, the Per Share Price pursuant to this
_Section 2.7_, but instead shall entitle the holder thereof only to such
rights as may be granted to a holder of Dissenting Company Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that any Dissenting Company
Share held by any Company Stockholder who shall have failed to perfect or who
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost his, her or its rights to appraisal
of such Dissenting Company Share pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL will
thereupon (x) be deemed no longer to be a Dissenting Company Share and (y) be
treated as if it had been converted into, and become exchangeable for, as of
the Effective Time, the right to receive the Per Share Price, without interest
thereon, upon surrender of the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares that
formerly evidenced such shares of Company Common Stock in the manner provided
in _Section 2.10_.

 



 

(ii) The Company will give Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company in respect
of Dissenting Company Shares; and (B) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
pursuant to the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company may not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or settle
or offer to settle any such demands for payment in respect of Dissenting
Company Shares. For purposes of this _Section 2.7(c)(ii)_, "participate"
means that Parent will be kept reasonably apprised of proposed strategy and
other significant decisions with respect to demands for appraisal pursuant to
the DGCL in respect of Dissenting Company Shares (to the extent that the
attorney-client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not
undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to such demands but will not be afforded any
decision-making power or other authority over such demands except for the
payment, settlement or compromise consent set forth above.

 



 

2.8 _Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each Company PSU that is outstanding immediately
before the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action by
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holder of that Company PSU, shall be
canceled and converted into the right to

 



      
 

 



 

receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation an amount in cash, without
interest, equal in value to the Per Share Price multiplied by the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each such holders Company
PSUs (assuming that the performance factor as of the Effective Time is equal
to 210%, which is the maximum level of performance achievable under the terms
of the Company PSUs) (the " **PSU Cash Payment** "), payable in two
installments through the Surviving Corporations payroll system as follows:
(i) at the Effective Time, the greater of (A) 50% of the PSU Cash Payment and
(B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company PSUs
that would otherwise vest pursuant to the applicable grant notice multiplied
by the Per Share Price (the " **PSU Closing Payment** ") and (ii) the excess
of the PSU Cash Payment over the PSU Closing Payment shall become payable on
the earlier of (I) the one-year anniversary of the Effective Time, subject to
the continued employment of such holder with Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries as of such one-year
anniversary and (II) the termination of such holders employment (A) by the
Company without cause (and other than due to death or disability) or (B) by
such holder for good reason (as such terms are defined in the applicable
agreements providing for the foregoing treatment of the Company PSUs).

 



 

(b) The payment of the amounts set forth in _Section 2.8(a)_ in respect of
the Company PSUs shall be reduced by any income or employment Tax withholding
required under the Code or any applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that any amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate
Governmental Authorities, those amounts shall be treated as having been paid
to the holder of those Company PSUs for all purposes under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and
after the Effective Time, maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy their
obligations to holders of Company PSUs pursuant to this _Section _ _2.8_.

 



 

(d) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay through its payroll system to each applicable
holder of a Company PSU, such amount due and payable to such holder pursuant
to _Section 2.8(a)_ in respect of such Company PSU.

 



 

(e) The Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to (i) as of the
date of this Agreement, (A) suspend the Direct Stock Purchase Program and (B)
prevent any additional transactions or issuances of Company Common Stock under
the Direct Stock Purchase Program to be processed on or after the date of this
Agreement and (ii) terminate the Direct Stock Purchase Program effective
immediately upon the Closing.

 



 

2.9 _Further Actions_. The Company will take all action necessary to effect
the cancellation, conversion and vesting, as applicable, of Company Stock-
Based Awards upon the Effective Time and to give effect to _Section 2.8_
(including the satisfaction of the requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated
under the Exchange Act). Except as otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties as
provided in _Section 2.8_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take all actions necessary so that all Company Stock-Based Awards and all
Company Equity Plans will terminate as of the Effective Time and so that the
provisions in any other Employee Plan or Contract providing for the issuance
or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company
Group will be cancelled as of the Effective Time. The Company will use its
reasonable

 



      
 

 



 

best efforts to ensure that following the Effective Time no participant in any
Company Equity Plan or other Employee Plan will have any right thereunder to
acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
of their respective Subsidiaries.

 



 

2.10 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Payment Agent_. Not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing, Parent will (i) select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable
to the Company to act as the payment agent for the Company Stockholders to
receive the Per Share Price to which they have become entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.7_ (the " **Payment Agent** "); and (ii) enter into a payment
agent agreement, in customary form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
Company, with such Payment Agent.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit (or cause
to be deposited) with the Payment Agent, for the benefit of the holders of
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, for payment to, the holders of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to _Section 2.7_, an amount of cash equal to the aggregate
consideration to which such holders of Company Common Stock become entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.7_. Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, such cash will be invested by the Payment Agent,
as directed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in (i) obligations of or
fully guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof
and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States with a maturity
of no more than 30 days; (ii) commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively; or (iii) certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1,000,000,000
(based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then
publicly available) and, in any case of the foregoing clauses (i) through
(iii), no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding three (3) months
(such cash and any proceeds thereon, the " **Exchange Fund** "). To the extent
that (A) there are any losses with respect to any investments of the Exchange
Fund; (B) the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required
for the Payment Agent to promptly pay the cash amounts contemplated by
_Section 2.7_; or (C) all or any portion of the Exchange Fund is unavailable
for Parent (or the Payment Agent on behalf of Parent) to promptly pay the cash
amounts contemplated by _Section 2.7_ for any reason, Parent will, or will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or restore the amount of
cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all
times fully available for distribution and maintained at a level sufficient
for the Payment Agent to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.7_. Any
income from investment of the Exchange Fund will be payable to Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as Parent directs.

 



 

(c) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, and in any
event not more than five (5) Business Days thereafter, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation will cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder of
record (as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) of (i) a certificate or
certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company
Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the " **Certificates** "); and (ii)
uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock that represented outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Company

 



      
 

 



 

Shares and Owned Company Shares) (the " **Uncertificated Shares** ") (A) a
letter of transmittal in customary form and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Payment Agent); and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in exchange for
the Per Share Price payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.7_.
Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates
will be entitled to receive, and the Payment Agent shall promptly pay, in
exchange therefor, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificate; by (y) the Per Share Price (less any
applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the Certificates
so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. Upon receipt of an "agents
message" by the Payment Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Payment Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer
of Uncertificated Shares, the holders of such Uncertificated Shares will be
entitled to receive, and the Payment Agent shall promptly pay, in exchange
therefor, an amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (1)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
holders transferred Uncertificated Shares; by (2) the Per Share Price (less
any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof), and the
transferred Uncertificated Shares so surrendered will be cancelled. The
Payment Agent will accept such Certificates and transferred Uncertificated
Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the
Payment Agent may impose to cause an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or accrued for the
benefit of holders of the Certificates and Uncertificated Shares on the Per
Share Price payable upon the surrender of such Certificates and Uncertificated
Shares pursuant to this _Section 2.10(c)_. Until so surrendered, outstanding
Certificates and Uncertificated Shares will be deemed from and after the
Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive the Per Share Price,
without interest thereon, payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section
2.7_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no holder of
Uncertificated Shares will be required to provide a Certificate or an executed
letter of transmittal to the Payment Agent in order to receive the payment
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 2.7_.

 



 

(d) _DTC Payment_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company will
cooperate to establish procedures with the Payment Agent and the Depository
Trust Company (" **DTC** ") with the objective that the Payment Agent will
transmit to DTC or its nominees on the first Business Day after the Closing
Date an amount in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, equal
to (A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock (other than Owned Company
Shares and Dissenting Company Shares) held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time; multiplied by (B) the Per Share
Price.

 



 

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock is not registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, or if the Per Share Price is to be paid in a name other than that in
which the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares surrendered or transferred in
exchange therefor are registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the
Company, the Per Share Price may be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated Share so surrendered or
transferred is registered in the stock transfer books or ledger of the Company
only if, in the case of shares of Company Common Stock

 



      
 

 



 

represented by a Certificate, such Certificate is properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for surrender and transfer or, in the case of
Uncertificated Shares, a proper transfer instruction is presented, and, in the
case of shares of Company Common Stock represented by Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares, the Person requesting such payment has paid to Parent
(or any agent designated by Parent) any transfer Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Per Share Price to a Person other than the registered
holder of such shares, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
(or any agent designated by Parent) that such transfer Taxes have been paid or
are otherwise not payable.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other Party will be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock for
any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



 

(g) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares on the date that is one (1) year after the Effective
Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of shares of
Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time who have not theretofore surrendered or transferred their
Certificates (or otherwise complied with _Section 2.12_ in the case of lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates) or Uncertificated Shares representing such
shares of Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to this _Section 2.10_
will thereafter look for payment of the Per Share Price payable in respect of
such shares of Company Common Stock solely to Parent (which shall remain
responsible for payment of the Per Share Price in respect thereof, subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws), solely as general creditors
thereof, for any claim to the Per Share Price to which such holders may be
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.7_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by such
holders two (2) years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier time as is
immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat
to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority, will, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their
successors, assigns or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.

 



 

2.11 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, (a) all shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be
outstanding and will automatically be converted or cancelled and retired, as
applicable in accordance with _Section 2.7_, and cease to exist; and (b)
holders of each Certificate or Uncertificated Share theretofore representing
any shares of Company Common Stock will cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the right to receive the Per Share Price payable therefor in
accordance with _Section 2.7_, or in the case of Dissenting Company Shares,
the rights pursuant to _Section 2.7(c)_. The Per Share Price paid in
accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ will be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of
shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance
with customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they will (subject to

 



      
 

 



 

compliance with the exchange procedures of _Section 2.10(c)_) be cancelled
and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 



 

2.12 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent will pay to such Person the Per Share
Price payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by
such Certificates pursuant to _Section 2.7_. Parent or the Payment Agent may,
in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Per
Share Price, require the Person claiming such Certificates to be lost, stolen
or destroyed to deliver a bond in customary form in such amount as it may
reasonably determine as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

2.13 _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Company
and the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
cash amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder
of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock-Based Awards such amounts
as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom pursuant to any Tax laws.
To the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts will be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 



 

2.14 _No Dividends or Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions with
respect to capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or
after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares.

any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub, then the directors and officers of the Company
and Merger Sub as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will take all
such lawful and necessary action.

Factors," "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," "Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and any other disclosures
contained or referenced therein of information, factors or risks that are
predictive, cautionary or forward-looking in nature) (the " **Recent SEC
Reports** ") (it being (i) understood that any matter disclosed in any Recent
SEC Report will be deemed to be disclosed in a section of the Company
Disclosure Letter only to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure in such
Recent SEC Report that it is applicable to such section of the Company
Disclosure Letter; and (ii) acknowledged that nothing disclosed in the Recent
SEC Reports will be deemed to modify or qualify the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section 3.7_ or _Section 3.12(b)_); or (b) subject

delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub on the date of this
Agreement (the " **Company Disclosure Letter** "), the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Organization; Good Standing_. The Company (a) is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing pursuant to the DGCL; and (b)
has the requisite corporate power and authority to conduct its business as it
is presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent
that the concept of "good standing" is applicable in the case of any
jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and complete
copies of the Charter and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the
" **Bylaws** "), each as amended to date. The Company is not in violation of
the Charter or the Bylaws.

 



 

3.2 _Corporate Power; Enforceability_. Assuming that none of Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" (as defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL) is an "interested stockholder" (as defined in Section
203 of the DGCL) of the Company (the " **Section 203 Assumption**"), the
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to (a) execute and
deliver this Agreement; (b) perform its covenants and obligations hereunder;
and (c) subject to receiving the Requisite Stockholder Approval, consummate
the Merger. Assuming the truth of the Section 203 Assumption, the execution
and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company
of its covenants and obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company and no additional corporate actions on the part of the Company are
necessary to authorize (i) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company; (ii) the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder; or (iii) subject to the receipt of the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the consummation of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (A) may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally; and (B) is
subject to general principles of equity (the " **Enforceability Limitations**
").

 



 

3.3 _Company Board Approval; Fairness Opinion; Anti-Takeover Laws_.

 



 

(a) _Company Board Approval_. The Company Board (at a meeting or meetings duly
called and held, and acting upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special

the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions

 



       
 

 



 

set forth herein; (ii) declared this Agreement advisable; (iii) approved the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the performance by
the Company of its covenants and other obligations hereunder, and the
consummation of the Merger upon the terms and conditions set forth herein; and
(iv) resolved to recommend that the Company Stockholders adopt this Agreement
and approve the Merger in accordance with the DGCL (collectively, including
the recommendation of the Special Committee, the " **Company Board
Recommendation** "), which Company Board Recommendation has not been
withdrawn, rescinded or modified in any way as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Fairness Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, the Company
Board and the Special Committee have received the written opinion (or an oral
opinion to be confirmed in writing) of Peter J. Solomon Securities Company,
LLC (the " **Advisor** ") to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion,
and based upon and subject to the various limitations, matters, qualifications
and assumptions set forth therein, the Per Share Price to be paid to the
holders (other than Parent and its Affiliates) of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a financial point of view to
such holders (it being understood and agreed that such written opinion is for
the benefit of the Company Board and the Special Committee and may not be
relied upon by Parent or Merger Sub).

 



 

(c) _Anti-Takeover Laws_. Assuming the truth of the Section 203 Assumption,
the Company Board has taken all necessary actions so that the restrictions on
business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL and any other
similar applicable "anti-takeover" law will not be applicable to the Merger,
this Agreement or the Voting Agreement.

 



 

3.4 _Requisite Stockholder Approval_. Assuming the truth of the Section 203
Assumption, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to vote on the Merger (the
" **Requisite Stockholder Approval** ") is the only vote of the holders of any
class or series of Company Capital Stock that is necessary pursuant to
applicable law, the Charter or the Bylaws to adopt this Agreement and
consummate the Merger.

 



 

3.5 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants and obligations
hereunder, and the consummation of the Merger do not (a) violate or conflict
with any provision of the Charter or the Bylaws; (b) violate, conflict with,
result in the breach of, constitute a default (or an event that, with notice
or lapse of time or both, would become a default) pursuant to, result in the
termination of, accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right
of termination or acceleration pursuant to any Material Contract; (c) assuming
that all Consents described in _Section 3.6_ have been obtained or made, and
any waiting periods thereunder have terminated or expired prior to the
Effective Time and, in the case of the consummation of the Merger, subject to
obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval and assuming the truth of the
Section 203 Assumption, violate or conflict with any law or order applicable
to the Company Group or by which any of their respective properties or assets
are bound; or (d) result in the creation of any lien (other than Permitted
Liens) upon any of the properties or assets of the Company Group, except in
the case of each of clauses (b), (c) and (d) for such violations, conflicts,
breaches, defaults, terminations, accelerations or liens that would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



      
 

 



 

3.6 _Requisite Governmental Approvals_. No consent, approval, order or
authorization of, filing or registration with, or notification to (any of the
foregoing, a " **Consent** ") any Governmental Authority is required on the
part of the Company (a) in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company; (b) the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) the consummation of the
Merger, except (i) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and such filings with Governmental
Authorities to satisfy the applicable laws of states in which the Company
Group is qualified to do business; (ii) such filings and approvals as may be
required by any federal or state securities laws, including compliance with
any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act; (iii) compliance with any
applicable requirements of the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust

Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has
received notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the

forth therein for the purpose of funding up to the aggregate value of the
Merger (including amounts referred to in clauses (ii) and (iii) of _Section
4.11(c)_) (such financing, the " **Equity Financing** "). The Equity

beneficiary thereof in connection with the Companys exercise of its rights
under _Section 9.8(b)_; and (B) subject in all respects to _Section 9.8(b)_,

applicable, of the full amount of the Equity Financing.

 



 

(c) _Sufficiency of Equity Financing_. The net proceeds of the Equity
Financing, when funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter,
together with available cash of the Company Group at Closing, will be, in the
aggregate, sufficient to (i) make the payment of all amounts payable pursuant
to _Article II_ in connection with or as a result of the Merger (including
the aggregate amount of PSU Cash Payments payable to holders of Company PSUs
pursuant to and at the times required by _Section 2.8_), (ii) repay, prepay

of time or both, would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) constitute a
default or breach on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor pursuant
to the Equity Commitment Letter; (ii) constitute or result in a failure to
satisfy any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter; or (iii) otherwise result in any portion of the Equity Financing not
being available (it being understood that Parent and Merger Sub are not making
any representation or warranty regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the
representations and warranties in _Article III_ or the Companys compliance
hereunder). As of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe
that (A) it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition
of the Equity Financing to be satisfied by it, whether or not such term or
condition is contained in the Equity Commitment Letter; or (B) the full
amounts committed pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter will not be
available as of the Closing if the terms or conditions contained in the Equity
Commitment Letter to be satisfied by it are satisfied (it being understood
that Parent and Merger Sub are not making any representation or warranty
regarding the effect of any inaccuracy of the representations and warranties
in _Article III_ or the Companys compliance hereunder). As of the date of
this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully

agent, broker, investment banker or financial advisor any financial advisory
role on an exclusive basis in connection with the Merger; or (ii) expressly
prohibiting any bank, investment bank or other potential provider of debt
financing from providing or seeking to provide debt financing or financial
advisory services to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to
the Company Group in connection with the Merger.

 



 

4.12 _Stockholder and Management Arrangements_. Except with respect to the
Voting Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent or Merger
Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates is a party to any Contract with any
stockholder (other than any existing limited partner of the Guarantor or any
of its Affiliates), director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the
Company Group (a) relating to (i) this Agreement or the Transactions; or (ii)
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, businesses or operations
(including as to continuing employment) from and after the Effective Time; or
(b) pursuant to which any (i) such holder of Company Common Stock would be
entitled to receive consideration of a different amount or nature

 



      
 

 



 

than the Per Share Price in respect of such holders shares of Company Common
Stock; (ii) such holder of Company Common Stock has agreed to approve this
Agreement or vote against any Superior Proposal; or (iii) such stockholder,
director, officer, employee or other Affiliate of the Company other than the
Guarantor has agreed to provide, directly or indirectly, equity investment to
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to finance any portion of the Merger.

 



 

4.13 _Solvency_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor is entering into
this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. As of
the Effective Time and immediately after giving effect to the Transactions
(including the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to _Article II_ in
connection with or as a result of the Merger and all related fees and expenses
of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries in
connection therewith), (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the
assets of each of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will exceed
(i) the value of all liabilities of the Surviving Corporation and such
Subsidiaries, including contingent and other liabilities; and (ii) the amount
that will be required to pay the probable liabilities of each of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries on their existing debts (including contingent
liabilities) as such debts become absolute and matured; (b) each of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will not have an unreasonably small
amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged
or proposed to be engaged; and (c) each of the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of the foregoing, "not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means
that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations
as they become due.

 



 

4.14 _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by or on behalf of Parent, Merger Sub or the Guarantor for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement will, at the date it is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders or at the time of the Company
Stockholder Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit

made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, no
representation is made by Parent or Merger Sub with respect to any other
statements made or incorporated by reference in the Proxy Statement.

this Agreement, during the period (the " **Go-Shop Period** ") beginning on
the date of this Agreement and continuing until 12:00 p.m., Eastern time on
July 20, 2017 (the " **No-Shop Period Start Date** "), the Company and its
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (collectively, "
**Representatives** ") shall have the right to: (i) solicit, initiate, propose
or induce the making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage,
facilitate or assist, any proposal or inquiry that constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) subject to the
entry into, and in accordance with, an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement,
furnish to any Person any non-public information relating to the Company Group
or afford to any Person access to the business, properties, assets, books,
records or other non-public information, or to any personnel, of the Company
Group, in any such case with the intent to induce the making, submission or
announcement of, or to knowingly encourage, facilitate or assist, any proposal
or inquiry that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries or the making of any proposal that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, _provided,
however,_ that the Company will promptly (and in any event within 24 hours)
provide to Parent, or provide Parent access to, any such non-public
information concerning the Company Group that is provided to any such Person
or its Representatives that was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives; and (iii) participate or engage in discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as expressly permitted by this
_Section 5.3_ and except in respect of an Exempted Party (but only for so
long as such Person or group of Persons is an Exempted Party) until the date
which is ten (10) days after the No-Shop Period Start Date (the " **Cut-off
Date** "), from and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company will and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their officers and directors
to, and will instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its other
Representatives to, (i) cease any solicitations, discussions or negotiations
with any Person that would be prohibited by this _Section 5.3(b)_, request
the prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning the
Company Group theretofore furnished to any such Person with whom a
confidentiality agreement was entered into within the six (6) month period
immediately preceding the No-Shop Period Start Date and terminate all access
granted to any such Person and its Representatives to any physical or
electronic data room; and (ii) until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, not,
directly or indirectly, (A) solicit, initiate, propose or knowingly induce the
making, submission or announcement of, or knowingly encourage, facilitate or
assist the making, submission or announcement of any proposal, inquiry or
offer that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; (B) furnish to any Person (other than to Parent, Merger Sub or any
designees of Parent or Merger Sub) or its Representatives (in their capacity
as such) any

 



      
 

 



 

non-public information relating to the Company Group or any Acquisition
Proposal or afford to any Person or its Representatives (in their capacity as
such) access to the business, properties, assets, books, records or other non-
public information, or to any personnel, of the Company Group (other than
Parent, Merger Sub or any designees of Parent or Merger Sub), in any such case
with the intent to induce the making, submission or announcement of an
Acquisition Proposal; (C) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations
with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than informing
such Persons of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.3_); or (D) enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition
Transaction, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (any such
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement, acquisition

**Alternative Acquisition Agreement** "). From the date of this Agreement
until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company will not be required to
enforce, and will be permitted to waive or release, any provision of any
standstill or confidentiality agreement solely to the extent that such
provision has the effect of prohibiting or purports to prohibit making a
confidential Acquisition Proposal to the Company Board (or any committee
thereof). For avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding the expiration of the Go-
Shop Period, the Company and its Representatives may, prior to the Cut-off
Date, continue to engage in the activities described in this _Section 5.3(b)_
with respect to Persons who are Exempted Parties (but only for so long as such
Person or group is an Exempted Party) and their Representatives, including
with respect to any amended proposal submitted by any Exempted Party following
the expiration of the Go-Shop Period and prior to the Cut-off Date, and the
restrictions in this _Section 5.3(b)_ shall not apply with respect thereto;
_provided_ that the provisions of _Section 5.3(e)_ shall apply to an
Acquisition Proposal of any Exempted Party.

 



 

(c) _Conduct Following No-Shop Period Start Date_. Notwithstanding anything
set forth in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time following the No-
Shop Period Start Date but prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder
Approval, the Company or any of its Representatives receives an Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from any material breach of this _Section 5.3_,
(i) the Company and its Representatives may contact the Person or group of
Persons making the Acquisition Proposal solely to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof or to request that any Acquisition Proposal made orally be
made in writing; and (ii) if the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
determined in good faith (after consultation with its independent financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal either
constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a
Superior Proposal, then the Company and the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) may, directly or indirectly through one or more of their
Representatives (including the Advisor), (A) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making the
Acquisition Proposal and its or their Representatives regarding such
Acquisition Proposal and (B) enter into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal
and furnish, or provide access to, pursuant to such Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement any non-public information relating to the Company Group or its
businesses, properties, assets, books, records or other non-public
information, or provide access to any personnel of the Company Group;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will promptly (and in any event
within 24 hours) provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the
Company Group that is provided to any such Person or group of Persons or its
or their Representatives that was not previously provided to Parent.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) _No Change in Company Board Recommendation or Entry into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. Except as provided by _Section 5.3(e)_, at no time
after the date of this Agreement may the Company Board (or a committee
thereof):

 



 

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to
withhold, withdraw, amend, qualify or modify, the Company Board Recommendation
in a manner adverse to Parent in any material respect; (B) adopt, approve,
endorse, recommend or otherwise declare advisable an Acquisition Proposal; (C)
fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within ten (10)
Business Days after Parent so requests in writing, which request is
transmitted after any public disclosure of an Acquisition Proposal (
_provided_ that the Company will have no obligation to make such reaffirmation
on more than two separate occasions); (D) take or fail to take any formal
action or make or fail to make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender or exchange offer, other than a recommendation
against such offer or a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders pursuant to Rule
14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any substantially similar
communication) (it being understood that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) may refrain from taking a position with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal until the close of business on the tenth (10th) Business Day after
the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in connection with such
Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered a violation of this
_Section 5.3_); or (E) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses (A) through (E), a "
**Company Board Recommendation Change** "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, for
the avoidance of doubt, none of (1) the determination by the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal; or (2) the delivery by the Company to Parent of any notice
contemplated by _Section 5.3(e)_ will constitute a Company Board
Recommendation Change; or

 



 

(ii) cause or permit the Company Group to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement.

 



 

(e) _Company Board Recommendation Change; Entry into Alternative Acquisition
Agreement_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval:

 



 

(i) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) may effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change in response to any material event, development,
discovery, change or circumstance with respect to the Company that (A) was not
known to, or reasonably expected by, the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement; and (B) does not relate to (a) any Acquisition Proposal; or (b) the
mere fact, in and of itself, that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or
published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue,
earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or
after the date of this Agreement, or changes after the date of this Agreement
in the market price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock or the
credit rating of the Company (an " **Intervening Event** ") (it being
understood that the foregoing clause (b) will not prevent or otherwise affect
a determination that any event, development, discovery, change or circumstance
underlying such fact or changes referred to in clause (b) has resulted in or
contributed to an Intervening Event), if the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to do so

 



       
 

 



 

would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable law and if and only if:

 



 

(1) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least two (2)
Business Days in advance to the effect that the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) has (A) so determined; and (B) intends to effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)(i)_, which notice will
specify the applicable Intervening Event in reasonable detail; and

 



 

(2) prior to effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company
and its Representatives, during such two (2) Business Day period, must have
(A) negotiated with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the
extent that Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) would no longer determine that the failure to make a
Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event
would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties pursuant to
applicable law; and (B) permitted Parent and its Representatives an
opportunity to make a presentation to the Company Board regarding this
Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to the extent that Parent
requests to make such a presentation); or

 



 

(ii) if the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, whether
during the Go-Shop Period or after the No-Shop Period Start Date, that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) has concluded in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes
a Superior Proposal and which did not result from any material breach of this
_Section 5.3_, then the Company Board may (A) effect a Company Board
Recommendation Change with respect to such Acquisition Proposal; or (B)
authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into an Alternative
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal, in each case
if and only if:

 



 

(1) the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations pursuant
to applicable law;

 



 

(2) the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations
pursuant to this _Section 5.3_ with respect to such Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(3) (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least three
(3) Business Days in advance (the " **Notice Period** "), which notice shall
state (A) that the Company has received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal that
has not been withdrawn and that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has
concluded in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal; (B) to the extent not
previously provided to Parent pursuant to _Section 5.3(f)_, the material
terms of such Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person or group of
Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and copies of all material documents
relating to such Acquisition Proposal; and (C) that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)(ii)_ absent
revisions to the terms and

 



      
 

 



 

conditions of this Agreement, which notice will specify the basis for such
Company Board Recommendation Change or termination; and (ii) prior to
effecting such Company Board Recommendation Change or termination, the Company
and its Representatives, during the Notice Period, must have (1) negotiated
with Parent and its Representatives in good faith (to the extent that Parent
desires to so negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute
a Superior Proposal; and (2) permitted Parent and its Representatives an
opportunity to make a presentation to the Company Board (or a committee
thereof) regarding this Agreement and any adjustments with respect thereto (to
the extent that Parent requests to make such a presentation); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that, in the event of any revisions to the financial terms or any
other material term or condition of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
will be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to comply with
the requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)(ii)(3)_ with respect to such new
written notice (except that the Notice Period in respect of such new written
notice shall be one (1) Business Day and the Company will not be required to
permit Parent and its Representatives an opportunity to make a presentation as
contemplated by clause (ii)(2) above); and

 



 

(4) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order to cause or
permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company will have validly terminated
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(h)_, including paying (or
causing to be paid) the Company Termination Fee in accordance with _Section
8.3(b)(iii)_.

 



 

(f) _Notice_. From the thirtieth (30th) day after the date of this Agreement
until the earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company will promptly (and, in any
event, within 24 hours thereafter) notify Parent in writing of (i) the receipt
by the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company, its Representatives of any
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) the identity of the Person or group of Persons
making such Acquisition Proposal; (iii) a copy of any such Acquisition
Proposal made in writing and any other written terms and proposals provided
(including financing commitments) to the Company or its Representatives; and
(iv) a written summary of material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal not made in writing. Thereafter, the Company must keep
Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt basis, of the status and
supplementally provide any change to the terms of any such Acquisition
Proposals (including as required by clauses (i) through (iv) above and any
amendments thereto) and the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 



 

(g) _Certain Disclosures_. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit the Company
or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) from (i) taking and disclosing
to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act, including a "stop, look and listen" communication by
the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the Company Stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
substantially similar communication); (ii) complying with Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act; (iii) informing any Person
of the existence of the provisions contained in this _Section 5.3_; or (iv)
making any disclosure to the Company Stockholders (including regarding the
business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company Group)
that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined to make in good
faith in order to comply with

 



      
 

 



 

applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement, it
being understood that any such statement or disclosure made by the Company
Board (or a committee thereof) pursuant to this _Section 5.3(g)_ must be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and will not limit or
otherwise affect the obligations of the Company or the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) and the rights of Parent under this _Section 5.3_, it
being understood that nothing in the foregoing will be deemed to permit the
Company or the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to effect a Company
Board Recommendation Change other than in accordance with _Section 5.3(e)_.
In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this Agreement,
a factually accurate public statement by the Company or the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) that describes the Companys receipt of an Acquisition
Proposal, the identity of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms of such Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto will not be deemed to be (A) a withholding,
withdrawal, amendment, or modification, or proposal by the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, the Company Board
Recommendation; (B) an adoption, approval or recommendation with respect to
such Acquisition Proposal; or (C) a Company Board Recommendation Change.

 



 

(h) _Breach by Representatives_. The Company agrees that any material breach
of this _Section 5.3_ by any of its Representatives, to the extent acting at
the Companys direction, that, if taken by the Company, would be a breach of
this _Section 5.3_, will be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 5.3_ by
the Company.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VI** ** 
ADDITIONAL COVENANTS**

 



 

6.1 _Required Action and Forbearance; Efforts_.

 



 

(a) _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions

Company, on the other hand, will, and will cause their respective Affiliates
to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to (A) take (or cause to be
taken) all actions; (B) do (or cause to be done) all things; and (C) assist
and cooperate with the other Parties in doing (or causing to be done) all
things, in each case as are necessary, proper or advisable pursuant to
applicable law or otherwise to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions, including by:

 



 

(i) causing the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ to be
satisfied;

 



 

(ii) (1) obtaining all consents, waivers, approvals, orders and authorizations
from Governmental Authorities; and (2) making all registrations, declarations
and filings with Governmental Authorities, in each case that are necessary or
advisable to consummate the Transactions;

 



 

(iii) obtaining all consents, waivers and approvals and delivering all
notifications pursuant to any Material Contracts in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions so as to maintain and
preserve the benefits to the Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation of such Material Contracts as of and following the consummation of
the Transactions; and

 



 

(iv) executing and delivering any Contracts and other instruments that are
reasonably necessary to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

(b) _No Failure to Take Necessary Action_. In addition to the foregoing,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including subject to
clause (D) of the second sentence of _Section 6.2(a)_), neither Parent or
Merger Sub, on the one hand, nor the Company, on the other hand, will take any
action, or fail to take any action, that is intended to or has (or would
reasonably be expected to have) the effect of (i) preventing, impairing,
delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the consummation of the
Transactions; or (ii) the ability of such Party to fully perform its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, no action
by the Company taken in compliance with _Section 5.3_ will be considered a

this _Section 6.1_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company Group will not

the Transactions, including in connection with obtaining any consent pursuant
to any Material Contract.

 



 

6.2 _Antitrust Filings_.

 



 

(a) _Filing Under the HSR Act and Other Applicable Antitrust Laws_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall, and in the case of Parent and Merger Sub shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, to the extent required in the reasonable judgment of counsel to
Parent and the Company, (i) file with the FTC and the Antitrust Division of
the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement and the
Transactions as required by the HSR Act within ten (10) Business Days
following the date of this Agreement; and (ii) promptly file comparable pre-
merger or post-merger notification filings, forms and submissions with any
Governmental Authority pursuant to other applicable Antitrust Laws in
connection with the Transactions, with the Parent having primary
responsibility for the making of such filings. Each of Parent and the Company
will use reasonable best efforts to (A) cooperate and coordinate (and cause
its respective Affiliates to cooperate and coordinate) with the other in the
making of such filings; (B) supply the other (or cause the other to be
supplied) with any information that may be required in order to make such
filings; (C) supply (or cause the other to be supplied) any additional
information that may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the
Governmental Authorities of any other applicable jurisdiction in which any
such filing is made; (D) cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws
applicable to the Transactions; and (E) obtain (or cause to be obtained) any

the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions, then
such Party will make (or cause to be made), as soon as reasonably practicable
and after consultation with the other Parties, an appropriate response

 



      
 

 



 

in compliance with such request. The parties to this Agreement shall not, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, take any action with the
intention to, or that would reasonably be expected to, hinder or delay the
expiration or termination of any waiting period under the HSR Act or the
obtaining of approval of the FTC and DOJ as necessary.

 



 

(b) _Divestitures_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if
and to the extent necessary to obtain clearance of the Transactions pursuant
to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws applicable to the Transactions,
each of Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, (i) offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree,
hold separate order, settlement, undertaking, stipulation or otherwise, (A)
the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any and all of the
capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or
intangible), rights, products or businesses of Parent and Merger Sub (and
their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company
Group, on the other hand; (B) the termination, amendment or assignment of
existing relationships or contractual rights or obligation of Parent and
Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company Group, on the other hand; (C) the change or modification of
any course of conduct regarding future operations of Parent and Merger Sub
(and their respective Affiliates), on the one hand, and the Company Group, on
the other hand; and (D) any other restrictions on the activities of Parent and
Merger Sub (and their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company Group, on the other hand, with respect to, or their ability to
retain, one or more of their respective businesses, assets or rights or
interests therein (each of the actions in the foregoing clauses (A) through
(D), a " **Regulatory Condition** "); and (ii) contest, defend and appeal any
Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, brought or threatened
to be brought by any Person (including any Governmental Authority) in order to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated, lifted or terminated, any order of any
kind or nature that would prevent the consummation of the Transactions from
occurring prior to the Termination Date. Except as expressly provided for
under this _Section 6.2_, all such efforts shall be unconditional and shall
not be qualified in any manner and no actions taken pursuant to this _Section
6.2_ shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur.
If any Regulatory Condition agreed to by Parent requires action by or with
respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets, and such action would constitute a breach of this Agreement, Parent
hereby consents to the taking of such action by the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the extent required by such Regulatory Condition.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event will
Parent or Merger Sub be obligated pursuant to this Agreement to, and the
Company will not without the written consent of Parent, sell, divest, license
or hold separate any capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses, or to take
or commit to take any action, unless the consummation or such transaction or
effectiveness of such action is conditioned upon the Closing.

 



 

(c) _Cooperation_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) and Parent and Merger Sub
shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to), subject to any
restrictions under applicable laws, (i) promptly notify the other parties
hereto of, and, if in writing, furnish the others with copies of (or, in the
case of oral communications, advise the others of the contents of) any
material communication received by such Person from a Governmental Authority
in connection with the Transactions and permit the other parties to review and
discuss in advance (and to consider in good faith any comments made by the

 



      
 

 



 

other parties in relation to) any proposed draft notifications, formal
notifications, filing, submission or other written communication (and any
analyses, memoranda, white papers, presentations, correspondence or other
documents submitted therewith) made in connection with the Transactions to a
Governmental Authority; (ii) keep the other parties reasonably informed with
respect to the status of any such submissions and filings to any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions and any developments, meetings
or discussions with any Governmental Authority in respect thereof, including
with respect to (A) the receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent,
approval or waiver, (B) the expiration of any waiting period, (C) the

equivalents of the other party without approval of the party providing the

6.3 _Proxy Statement and Other Required SEC Filings_.

 



 

(a) _Proxy Statement_. Promptly following the date of this Agreement (and in
any event within thirty (30) days), the Company will prepare and file with the
SEC a preliminary proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the " **Proxy
Statement** ") relating to the Company Stockholder Meeting. Subject to
_Section 5.3_, the Company must include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy Statement.

 



 

(b) _Other Required Company Filing_. If the Company determines that it is
required to file any document other than the Proxy Statement with the SEC in
connection with the Transactions pursuant to applicable law (such document, as
amended or supplemented, an " **Other Required Company Filing** "), then the
Company will promptly prepare and file such Other Required Company Filing with
the SEC. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement and any Other Required Company Filing to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules of the SEC and NASDAQ. The Company may not file the Proxy Statement or
any Other Required Company Filing with the SEC without first providing Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and
the Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel. On the date of filing,
the date of mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the
time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any
Other Required Company Filing will contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not false or

 



      
 

 



 

misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by the Company
with respect to any information supplied by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
or any Other Required Company Filing. The information supplied by Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Proxy Statement or any Other Required Company Filing will
not, at the time that the Proxy Statement or such Other Required Company
Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

 



 

(c) _Other Required Parent Filing_. If Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates determines that it is required to file any document with
the SEC in connection with the Transactions or the Company Stockholder Meeting
pursuant to applicable law (an " **Other Required Parent Filing** "), then
Parent and Merger Sub will, and will cause their respective Affiliates to,
promptly prepare and file such Other Required Parent Filing with the SEC.
Parent and Merger Sub will cause, and will cause their respective Affiliates
to cause, any Other Required Parent Filing to comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules of the SEC. Neither Parent or Merger Sub nor any of their respective
Affiliates may file any Other Required Parent Filing (or any amendment
thereto) with the SEC without first providing the Company and its counsel a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon, and Parent will give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company or its counsel. On the date of filing, the date of
mailing to the Company Stockholders (if applicable) and at the time of the
Company Stockholder Meeting, no Other Required Parent Filing may contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not false or
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no covenant is made by Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to any information supplied by the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Other Required Parent Filing.
The information supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in any Other Required Parent Filings will not, at the time that such
Other Required Parent Filing is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 



 

(d) _Furnishing Information_. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, will furnish all information concerning it
and its Affiliates, if applicable, as the other Party may reasonably request
in connection with the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy
Statement and any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required Parent
Filing. If at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Meeting any
information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates should be discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such
filing would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, then the Party that discovers such information will promptly
notify the

 



      
 

 



 

other, and an appropriate amendment or supplement to such filing describing
such information will be promptly prepared and filed with the SEC by the
appropriate Party and, to the extent required by applicable law or the SEC or
its staff, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be, without first
providing the other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such written communication, and each Party will give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other
Parties or their respective counsel.

 



 

(f) _Notices_. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for (i) any amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any
Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; (ii) any receipt of comments
from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company
Filing or any Other Required Parent Filing, as the case may be; or (iii) any
receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff for additional information in
connection therewith.

 



 

(g) _Dissemination of Proxy Statement_. Subject to applicable law, the Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be
disseminated to the Company Stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the filing thereof with the SEC and confirmation from the SEC that
it will not review, or that it has completed its review of, the Proxy
Statement; _provided_ , that the Company shall not be required to mail the
Proxy Statement prior to the date that is forty-five (45) days after the date
hereof.

 



 

6.4 _Company Stockholder Meeting_.

 



 

(a) _Call of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company will take all action necessary in accordance with the
DGCL, the Charter, the Bylaws and the rules of NASDAQ to establish a record
date for (and the Company will not change the record date without the prior
written consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed)), duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " **Company Stockholder Meeting** ") as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the mailing of the Proxy
Statement to the Company Stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, _provided_ that such Company Stockholder
Meeting shall not be required prior to the No-Shop Period Start Date or, if
applicable due to an ongoing Exempted Party, the Cut-Off Date. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company will not be required
to convene and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting at any time prior to the
twentieth (20th) Business Day following the mailing of the Proxy Statement to
the Company Stockholders. Subject to _Section 5.3_ and unless there has been
a Company Board Recommendation Change, the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit proxies to obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Adjournment of Company Stockholder Meeting_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, nothing will prevent the Company from
postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholder Meeting if (i) there are
holders of an insufficient number of shares of the Company Common Stock
present or represented by proxy at the Company Stockholder Meeting to
constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholder Meeting; (ii) the Company is
required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting by applicable
law, order or a request from the SEC or its staff; (iii) the Company has
notified Parent pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)_ that the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) intends to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change or
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 5.3(e)(ii)_ and the
applicable notice period thereunder will not have expired prior to the then-
scheduled date and time of the Company Stockholder Meeting; or (iv) the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) has determined in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that such postponement or adjournment
is required by applicable law in order to give the Company Stockholders
sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has
sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made available to the Company
Stockholders by issuing a press release, filing materials with the SEC or
otherwise. Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with
_Section 8.1_, the Company will submit this Agreement and the Merger to its
stockholders at the Company Stockholder Meeting even if the Company Board (or
a committee thereof) has effected a Company Board Recommendation Change.

construed to require, either Parent or Merger Sub to (i) bring any enforcement
action against any source of the Equity Financing to enforce its rights
pursuant to the Equity Commitment Letter (it being understood that Parent and
Merger Sub will seek

 



      
 

 



 

to enforce, including by bringing suit for specific performance, the Equity
Commitment Letter if the Company seeks and is granted a decree of specific
performance of the obligation to consummate the Merger); or (ii) seek the
Equity Financing from any source other than a counterparty to, or in any
amount in excess of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter.

(h) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Debt Financing is not a condition to the Closing. If the

to be obligated, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set

6.7 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. The Company and the Company Board (and any committee

their power to ensure that no "anti-takeover" statute or similar statute or
regulation (or, in the case of Section 203 of the DGCL, the restrictions on
"business combinations" contained therein) is or becomes applicable to the

(under Company supervision) during normal business hours, upon reasonable
advance notice, to the properties, books and records and personnel of the
Company, except that the Company may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
any documents or information to the extent that (a) any applicable law or
regulation requires the Company to restrict or otherwise prohibit access to
such documents or information; (b) access to such documents or information
would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such documents or

otherwise bound would violate or cause a default pursuant to, or give a third

third Persons; or (e) such documents or information relate to the negotiation
and execution of this Agreement, are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal

construed to require the Company Group or any of its Representatives to
prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or other information. Any
investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this _Section
6.8_ will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with
the conduct of the business of the Company Group or create a risk of damage or
destruction to any property or assets of the Company Group. Any access to the
properties of the Company Group will be subject to the Companys reasonable
security measures and insurance requirements and will not include the right to

honor and fulfill, in all respects, the obligations of the Company Group
pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company Group and any

who becomes a director or officer of the Company Group prior to the Effective
Time) (collectively, the " **Indemnified Persons** ") for any acts or
omissions by such Indemnified Persons occurring prior

cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws and other similar organizational
documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain

and advancement of expenses provisions set forth in the Charter, the Bylaws
and the other similar organizational documents of the Subsidiaries of the
Company, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement. During such six-year
period, such provisions may not be repealed, amended or otherwise modified in

indirectly, out of or pertains, directly or indirectly, to (i) any action or
omission, or alleged action or omission, in such Indemnified Persons capacity
as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company Group or other
Affiliates to the extent that such action or omission, or alleged action or
omission, occurred prior to or at the Effective Time; and (ii) the
Transactions, as well as any actions taken by the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub with respect thereto (including any disposition of assets of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries that is alleged to have rendered the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries insolvent), except that if,
at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any
Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.10(b)_, then the claim asserted
in such notice will survive the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time
until such claim is fully and finally resolved. In the event of any such Legal
Proceeding, (A) the Surviving Corporation will have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by
electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be
deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons
entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto); (B) each
Indemnified Person will be entitled to retain his or her own counsel (the
reasonable and documented fees and expenses of which will be paid by the
Surviving Corporation), whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to
control the defense of any such Legal Proceeding; (C) the Surviving
Corporation will advance all fees and expenses (including fees and expenses of
any counsel) as incurred by an Indemnified Person in the defense of such Legal
Proceeding, whether or not the Surviving Corporation elects to control the
defense of any such Legal Proceeding; and (D) no Indemnified Person will be
liable for any settlement of such Legal Proceeding effected without his or her
prior written consent (unless such settlement relates only to monetary damages
for which the Surviving Corporation is entirely responsible). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates will settle or otherwise
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise seek the termination of, any Legal Proceeding for which
indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such Legal Proceeding. Any determination required to be made with
respect to whether the conduct of any Indemnified Person complies or complied
with any applicable standard will be made by independent legal counsel
selected by the Surviving Corporation (which counsel will be reasonably
acceptable to such Indemnified Person), the fees and expenses of which will be
paid by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(c) _D andO Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain
in effect the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance
(" **D andO Insurance**") in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time on terms (including with respect to coverage,
conditions, retentions, limits and amounts) that are equivalent to those of
the DandO Insurance. In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this _Section
6.10(c)_, the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for
its last full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the " **Maximum Annual Premium**
"). If the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum
Annual Premium, then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum Annual Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better
credit rating as the Companys current directors and officers liability
insurance carrier. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may purchase a
prepaid "tail" policy with respect to the DandO Insurance from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance carrier so long as the annual
cost for such "tail" policy does not exceed the Maximum Annual Premium. If the
Company elects to purchase such a "tail" policy prior to the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to) maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and
continue to honor its obligations thereunder for so long as such "tail" policy
is in full force and effect.

 



 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
in such consolidation or merger; (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person; or (iii) dissolves, then proper
provisions will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns will
assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set
forth in this _Section 6.10_.

 



 

(e) _No Impairment_. The obligations set forth in this _Section 6.10_ may not
be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person who is a beneficiary
pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section
6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and representatives)) without the prior written
consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person. Each of the
Indemnified Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this _Section 6.10_, with full rights of enforcement as if a Party. The
rights of the Indemnified Persons

 



      
 

 



 

(and other persons who are beneficiaries pursuant to the DandO Insurance or the
"tail" policy referred to in _Section 6.10(c)_ (and their heirs and
representatives)) pursuant to this _Section 6.10_ will be in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have pursuant
to (i) the Charter and Bylaws; (ii) the similar organizational documents of
the Subsidiaries of the Company; (iii) any and all indemnification agreements
entered into with the Company Group; or (iv) applicable law (whether at law or
in equity).

 



 

(f) _Other Claims_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, or will be
construed to, release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims pursuant to any applicable insurance policy, indemnification
agreement, certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational
document that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company Group
for any of its directors, officers or other employees, it being understood and
agreed that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.10_ is not
prior to or in substitution for any such claims pursuant to such policies or
agreements.

 



 

6.11 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Employment; Benefits_. As of the Closing, the Surviving Corporation or
one of its Subsidiaries will continue to employ the employees of the Company
Group as of the Effective Time. For a period of not less than one (1) year
following the Effective Time (the " **Continuation Period** ") the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) maintain for the benefit of each
Continuing Employee compensation and employee benefits (other than equity-
based benefits) at compensation and benefit levels that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those in effect at the Company Group
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for at
least the duration of the Continuation Period, base compensation and target
incentive compensation opportunity (each as in effect at the Company Group on
the date of this Agreement) will not be decreased for any Continuing Employee
employed during the Continuation Period.

 



 

(b) _Severance Programs_. The Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will
(and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to)
honor all Employee Plans set forth in Section 3.18(a) of the Company
Disclosure Letter (including the Company Severance Plan) and the CIC
Protection Agreements entered into in accordance with _Section 5.2(i)_ in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, subject to any amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by
such Employee Plans and except as provided herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for the later of the duration of the Continuation Period or the
remaining term of any individual employment, severance or separation agreement
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to), provide each Continuing Employee who suffers a
termination of employment under circumstances that would have given the
Continuing Employee a right to severance payments and benefits under the
Company Groups severance policy or individual employment, severance or
separation agreement or other arrangement in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, that are listed on Section 6.11(b) of the Company Disclosure
Letter and that have been provided to Parent prior to or as of the date hereof
(each such listed arrangement, a " **Company Severance Plan** ") and which
Company Severance Plans only apply to the Continuing Employees set forth on a
spreadsheet previously provided to Parent on

 



      
 

 



 

May 20, 2017 (the " **Covered Severance Plan Employees** ") with severance
payments and benefits no less favorable than those that would have been
provided to such Continuing Employee under the applicable terms of the Company
Severance Plan.

 



 

(c) _New Plans_. To the extent that a new employee benefit plan is made
available to any Continuing Employee at or after the Effective Time (each a "
**New Plan** "), the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause to
be granted to such Continuing Employee credit for all service with the Company
Group prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant
(including for purposes of vacation accrual and severance pay entitlement),
except that such service need not be credited to the extent that it would
result in duplication of coverage or benefits. In addition, where applicable,
and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will use commercially reasonable efforts to
ensure that: (i) at the Effective Time, each Continuing Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in each New
Plan to the extent such waiting time was satisfied under a similar or
comparable Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " **Old
Plans** "), (ii) at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) cause all pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations
and actively-at-work requirements of each New Plan that is a health plan to be
waived or satisfied for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under the analogous Old Plan as
of the Effective Time and (iii) at the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause all eligible expenses incurred by
each Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion
of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employees
participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

 



 

(d) _2017 Fiscal Year Bonus Plan_. Notwithstanding any permitted amendment,
termination or discretion applicable to any Employee Plan that provides for
the payment of annual cash bonuses, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries will (and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) to the extent not already paid prior to Closing, pay bonuses
to Continuing Employees in respect of fiscal year 2017 (" **2017 Bonuses** ")
(i) to Continuing Employees that are eligible for such bonus payments and (ii)
in an amount determined by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) in good
faith and in the ordinary course of business based on actual achievement of
applicable performance goals which 2017 Bonuses in the aggregate shall not
exceed the amount set forth on Section 6.11(d) of the Company Disclosure
Letter. The 2017 Bonuses shall be paid by the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, at the time or times that the 2017 Bonuses would
normally be paid by the Company in the ordinary course of business (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, subject to any continuing employment conditions).

 



 

(e) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this _Section 6.11_ will not be deemed
to (i) guarantee employment for any

 



      
 

 



 

period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to terminate any
Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to continue any Employee
Plan or prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after the
Effective Time; (iii) create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person;
or (iv) establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement.

 



 

6.12 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent will take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to consummate the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and
Merger Sub will be jointly and severally liable for the failure by either of
them to perform and discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements
and obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

6.13 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

earlier to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company will give prompt notice to Parent

Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any
failure by the Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy, or failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ to fail to be
satisfied at the Closing, except that no such notification will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or the conditions to the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
to consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to
any information provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.13(a)_.

 



 

(b) _Notification by Parent_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and
the Effective Time, Parent will give prompt notice to the Company upon
becoming aware that any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger
Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect,
or of any failure by Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the
extent that such untruth, inaccuracy or failure would reasonably be expected
to cause any of the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate
the Merger set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ to fail to be
satisfied at the Closing, except that no such notification will affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub set

consummate the Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this
Agreement. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement apply to
any information provided to the Company pursuant to this _Section 6.13(b)_.

 



       
 

 



 

6.14 _Public Statements and Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning
this Agreement and the Transactions will be a joint press release reasonably
acceptable to the Company and Parent (the " **Announcement** "). Thereafter,
the Company (other than any communication principally related to a Company
Board Recommendation Change), on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on
the other hand, will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consult
with the other Parties before (a) participating in any media interviews; (b)
engaging in any meetings or calls with analysts, institutional investors or
other similar Persons; or (c) providing any statements that are public or are
reasonably likely to become public, in any such case to the extent relating to
the Transactions, except that the Company will not be obligated to engage in
such consultation with respect to communications that are (i) required by
applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule or listing agreement; (ii)
principally directed to employees, suppliers, customers, partners or vendors
so long as such communications are consistent with the previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the Parties

to a Superior Proposal or Company Board Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, this Section 6.14 shall not apply to any press release or other
public statement made by the Company or Parent (x) that is consistent with the
Announcement and the terms of this Agreement and does not contain any
information relating to the Company or Parent that has not been previously
announce or made public in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or (y)
is made in the ordinary course of business and does not relate specifically to
the signing of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

6.15 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will
provide Parent with prompt notice of all Transaction Litigation (including by
providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company will (a)
give Parent the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement or
prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b) consult with Parent with
respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of any Transaction
Litigation. The Company may not compromise, settle or come to an arrangement
regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding,
any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented thereto in writing
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For
purposes of this _Section 6.15_, "participate" means that Parent will be kept
apprised of proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to
the Transaction Litigation by the Company (to the extent that the attorney-
client privilege between the Company and its counsel is not undermined or
otherwise affected), and Parent may offer comments or suggestions with respect
to such Transaction Litigation but will not be afforded any decision-making

delisting of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ as promptly as practicable

Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after such
delisting.

 



      
 

 



 

6.17 _Additional Agreements_. If at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all
properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of
the Company or Merger Sub, then the proper officers and directors of each
Party will use their reasonable best efforts to take such action.

 



 

6.18 _Parent Vote_. Effective immediately following the execution and delivery

give Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand,
directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the business or
operations of the other at any time prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, each of Parent and the Company will exercise, consistent with

supervision over their own business and operations.

 



 

6.20 _Credit Facility_. At the Effective Time, Parent will provide (or cause

Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement will be true and correct on
and as of the Closing Date with the same force and effect as if made on and as

such condition to be satisfied or otherwise have given rise to a right of
termination of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII** ** 
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER**

 



 

8.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be validly terminated only as follows

statue, rule, regulation or order;

to consummate the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ prior to the Termination
Date; or (B) the failure of the Effective Time to have occurred prior to the
Termination Date (it being agreed that Parent and Merger Sub shall be a single

satisfied;

 



 

(h) by the Company, at any time prior to the receipt of the Requisite

8.2 _Manner and Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination_.

 



 

(a) _Manner of Termination_. The Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ (other than pursuant to _Section 8.1(a)_) must deliver prompt
written notice thereof to the other Parties setting forth in reasonable detail
the provision of _Section 8.1_ pursuant to which this Agreement is being
terminated and the facts and circumstances forming the basis for such
termination pursuant to such provision.

 



 

(b) _Effect of Termination_. Any proper and valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_ will be effective immediately upon the
mutual written agreement of Parent and the Company or the delivery of written
notice by the terminating Party to the other Parties. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement will
be of no further force or effect without liability of any Party (or any
partner, member, manager, stockholder, director, officer, employee, Affiliate,
agent or other representative of such Party) to the other Parties, as
applicable, except that _Section 4.15_, _Section 6.6(d)_, _Section 6.6(e)_,
_Section 6.6(f)_, _Section 6.14_, this _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3_ and
_Article IX_ will each survive the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing but
subject to _Section 8.3(f)_, nothing in this Agreement will relieve any Party
from any liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. For purposes of
this Agreement, " **willful breach** " means a material breach of this
Agreement that is the consequence of an act or omission by a Party with the
actual knowledge or intention that the taking of such act or omission would
constitute a material breach of this Agreement. In addition to the foregoing,
no termination of this Agreement will affect the rights or obligations of any
Party pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement or the Guaranty, which rights,
obligations and agreements will survive the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with their respective terms.

 



 

8.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) _General_. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions will be paid
by the Party incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Merger is
consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent or the Surviving Corporation
will be responsible for all fees and expenses of the Payment Agent. Parent
will pay or cause to be paid all (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or
fees; and (ii) sales, use, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or
fees arising out of or in connection with entering into this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger. With respect to the preparation and filing of tax
returns as related to the foregoing Taxes, Parent and the Company Group shall
cooperate with

 



      
 

 



 

each other and provide such documents and assistance as may be necessary to
prepare all tax returns, and Parent shall timely file such tax returns.

 



 

(b) _Company Payments_.

 



 

(i) If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)_,
_Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_; (B) at the time of such termination,
the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ and _Section 7.1(c)_ have been
satisfied or are capable of being satisfied and the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.3(a)_ and _Section 7.3(b)_ would be satisfied if the date of such
termination was the Closing Date; (C) following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1(c)_, _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_, an Acquisition
Proposal for an Acquisition Transaction has been publicly announced or
disclosed and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned; and (D) within one (1)
year following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)_, _Section 8.1(d)_ or _Section 8.1(e)_, as applicable, either an
Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a definitive
agreement providing for the consummation of an Acquisition Transaction and
such Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated, then the Company
will concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction pay
(or cause to be paid) to Parent an amount equal to $12,000,000 (the "
**Company Termination Fee** "). For purposes of this _Section 8.3(b)(i)_, all
references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Transaction" will be
deemed to be references to "50%."

 



 

(ii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(f)_,
then the Company must promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days)
following such termination pay (or cause to be paid) to Parent the Company
Termination Fee.

 



 

(iii) If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_,
then prior to or concurrently with such termination the Company must pay (or
cause to be paid) to Parent the Company Termination Fee; _provided,_ that if
such termination occurs prior to the Cut-off Date and the Company has entered
into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement to consummate an
Acquisition Transaction with a Person or group of Persons that is an Exempted
Party at the time of such termination, then the "Company Termination Fee"
shall mean an amount equal to $5,300,000.

 



 

(c) _Parent Payments_. If this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1(g)_ due to the willful breach of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Sub or _Section 8.1(i)_, then Parent must promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) following such termination pay to the Company an
amount equal to $24,000,000 (the " **Parent Termination Fee** ").

 



 

(d) _Single Payment Only; Liquidated Damages_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that in no event will the Company or Parent be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, on more than
one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination
Fee, as applicable, may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this
Agreement at the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of
different events. The Parties agree that each of the Company Termination Fee
and the Parent Termination Fee constitutes liquidated damages and not a
penalty.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Payments; Default_. The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Merger, and that, without
these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay any amount due pursuant to
_Section 8.3(c)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal Proceeding that
results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section
8.3(b)_ or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set
forth in _Section 8.3(c)_ or any portion thereof, as applicable, then the
non-paying Party will pay or cause to be paid to the other Party its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such Legal
Proceeding, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the
annual rate of 5% plus the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street
Journal_ in effect on the date that such payment or portion thereof was
required to be made through the date that such payment or portion thereof was
actually received, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by
applicable law. All payments under this _Section_ _ _ _8.3_ to be made by the
Company to Parent shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Parent, and all payments under
this _Section_ _ _ _8.3_ to be made by Parent to the Company shall be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated in
writing by the Company.

agreement executed in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis of such termination
(except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with

8.3(a)_, _Section 8.3(e)_, _Section 9.4_ and the Enforcement Expenses (as
defined in the Guaranty), as applicable); and (2) none of Parent, Merger Sub
or any other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or
proceeding against the Company or any Company Related Party arising out of
this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis
for such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will

of the Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement) exceed an amount
equal to $12,000,000 plus any costs and expenses in connection with a Legal
Proceeding payable pursuant to _Section 8.3(e)_ in the aggregate for all such
breaches (the " **Company Liability Limitation** "). In no event will any of
the Parent Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their
Representatives or any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain,
nor will any Person be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery or
monetary award in excess of the Company Liability Limitation against any of
the Company Related Parties, and in no event will Parent, Merger Sub or the
Parent Related Parties be entitled to seek or obtain any monetary damages of
any kind, including consequential, special, indirect or punitive damages, in
excess of the Company Liability Limitation against the Company Related Parties
for, or with respect to, this Agreement or the Transactions, the termination
of this Agreement, the failure to consummate any of the Transactions or any

damages to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person relating to or arising out
of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 



 

(iv) The Companys receipt of the Parent Termination Fee, to the extent owed

Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, the termination of this Agreement, the
failure to consummate any of the Transactions or any claims or actions under
applicable law arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, and
upon payment of such amount, (1) none of the Parent Related Parties will have
any further liability or obligation to the Company relating to or arising out
of this Agreement, any agreement executed in connection herewith or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis
of such termination (except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain
obligated with respect to, and Parent and Merger Sub may be entitled to
remedies with respect to, _Section 8.3(a)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_, as
applicable); and (2) none of the Company Group or any other Person will be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against Parent,

(except that the Parties (or their Affiliates) will remain obligated with
respect to, and Parent and Merger Sub may be entitled to remedies with respect
to, _Section 8.3(a)_ and _Section 8.3(e)_, as applicable).

to the contrary in _Section 8.3(f)_, it is agreed that Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company will be entitled to an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief as provided in _Section 9.8(b)_, except that, although the
Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies
hereunder, including by pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but
subject to the terms and limitations of, _Section 9.8(b)_, under no
circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both
specific performance of the type contemplated by _Section 9.8(b)_ and any
monetary damages.

 



 

(h) _Non-Recourse Parent Party_. In no event will the Company or any Company
Related Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of its
Representatives to seek or obtain, nor will any Person be entitled to seek or
obtain, any monetary recovery or monetary award against any Non-Recourse
Parent Party (as defined in the Equity Commitment Letter, which excludes, for

Merger Sub and the Company (pursuant to authorized action by the Company Board
(or a committee thereof)), except that in the event that the Company has
received the Requisite Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made to this

any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; and (c) subject

agreements or conditions for the benefit of such Party contained herein. Any

in exercising any right pursuant to this Agreement will not constitute a
waiver of such right.

 



 

8.6 _No Liability of Financing Sources_. None of the Financing Sources will
have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates relating to or
arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise, whether at law

this Agreement) to the extent the Company and/or its Affiliates are party

Guaranty and the Equity Commitment Letter, constitute the entire agreement
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement will (a) not be
superseded; (b) survive any termination of this Agreement; and (c) continue in
full force and effect until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the
date on which the Confidentiality Agreement expires in accordance with its
terms or is validly terminated by the parties thereto.

 



 

9.6 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in _Section 6.6(f)_,
_Section 6.10_ and this _Section 9.6_, the Parties agree that their
respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this
Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties in accordance with
and subject to the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement is not intended to,
and will not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder,
except (a) as set forth in or contemplated by _Section 6.6(f)_ and _Section
6.10_; and (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock and Company Stock-Based Awards to receive the
merger consideration set forth in _Article II_. The rights granted pursuant
to clause (b) of the second sentence of this _Section 9.6_ will only be
enforceable on behalf of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Stock-Based Awards by the Company, in its sole and absolute
discretion, as agent for such holders, and it is understood and agreed that
any and all interests in such claims will attach to such shares of the Company
Common Stock or Company Stock-Based Awards and subsequently transfer therewith
and, consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or
received by the Company with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred
by the Company in connection therewith and subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section 8.3(f)_) may, in the Companys sole and absolute
discretion, be (A) distributed, in whole or in part, by the Company to such
holders as of any date determined by the Company; or (B) retained by the
Company for the use and benefit of the Company in any manner that the Company
deems fit. The provisions of _Section 6.6(a)_, _Section 8.3(f)(i)_, _Section
8.4_, _Section 8.6_, _Section 9.8(b)(i)_, _Section 9.10_, _Section 9.11_
and this _Section 9.6_ will inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and
their successors and assigns, each of whom are intended to be third party
beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and agreed that the provisions of
such Sections will be enforceable by the Financing Sources and their
respective successors and assigns).

 



 

9.7 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to
replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid
and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



      
 

 



 

9.8 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby or by law or
equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy. Although the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance and monetary damages, under no
circumstances will the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in the occurrence of the Closing
and monetary damages (including any monetary damages in lieu of specific
performance).

 



 

(b) _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(i) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform the provisions of this Agreement (including any
Party failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in order to
consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or otherwise
breach such provisions. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, subject to
_Section 8.6_, (A) the Parties will be entitled, in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches (or
threatened breaches) of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof; (B) the provisions of _Section 8.3_ are not intended
to and do not adequately compensate the Company, on the one hand, or Parent
and Merger Sub, on the other hand, for the harm that would result from a
breach of this Agreement, and will not be construed to diminish or otherwise
impair in any respect any Partys right to an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief; and (C) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the Merger and without that right, neither the Company nor
Parent would have entered into this Agreement. It is explicitly agreed that
the Company shall have the right to an injunction, specific performance or
other equitable remedies in connection with enforcing Parents and Merger
Subs obligations to consummate the Merger and cause the Equity Financing to
be funded to fund the Merger (including to cause Parent to enforce the
obligations of the Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter in order to
cause the Equity Financing to be timely completed in accordance with and
subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Commitment
Letter). Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in no
event shall the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other member of
the Company Group, or any of their respective Affiliates be entitled to seek
equitable remedies, including, by way of example, an injunction or specific
performance of this Agreement, against any Financing Source.

 



 

(ii) The Parties agree not to raise any objections to (A) the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company, on
the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand; and (B) the
specific performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants, obligations and agreements of Parent and Merger Sub pursuant to
this Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each Party irrevocably
waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or
posting of any such bond or other security.

 



 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware.

 



 

9.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) _General Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties (i) irrevocably consents to
the service of the summons and complaint and any other process (whether inside
or outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts) in any Legal
Proceeding relating to the Transactions, for and on behalf of itself or any of
its properties or assets, in accordance with _Section 9.2_ or in such other
manner as may be permitted by applicable law, and nothing in this _Section
9.10_ will affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by applicable law; (ii) irrevocably and unconditionally
consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in any Legal
Proceeding to the exclusive general jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware and any state appellate court therefrom within the State
of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to
accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any federal court within the
State of Delaware) (the " **Chosen Courts** ") in the event that any dispute
or controversy arises out of this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby; (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court; (iv) agrees that any Legal Proceeding arising in connection
with this Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby will be brought, tried and determined only in the Chosen Courts; (v)
waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any
such Legal Proceeding in the Chosen Courts or that such Legal Proceeding was
brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the same;
and (vi) agrees that it will not bring any Legal Proceeding relating to this
Agreement, the Guaranty or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby in
any court other than the Chosen Courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees that a final judgment in any Legal Proceeding in the Chosen
Courts will be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law.

 



 

(b) _Jurisdiction for Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and irrevocably agree (i)
that any Legal Proceeding, whether in law or in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise, involving the Financing Sources arising out of, or relating to,
the Merger, the Debt Financing or the performance of services thereunder or
related thereto will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in the State of New York in the borough of Manhattan and
any appellate court thereof, and each Party submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such Legal Proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court; (ii) not to bring or permit any of their
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Legal
Proceeding in any other court; (iii) that service of process, summons, notice
or document by registered mail addressed to them at their respective addresses
provided in any applicable debt commitment letter will be effective service of
process against them for any such Legal Proceeding brought in any such court;
(iv) to waive and hereby waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which any of them may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any

 



      
 

 



 

such Legal Proceeding in any such court; and (v) any such Legal Proceeding
will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York. Each of the Parties further agrees that it shall not bring or support
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source, in any way relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, including any dispute
arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, but, for the
avoidance of doubt, other than any definitive agreements executed in
connection with the Debt Financing or the performance thereof.

 



 

9.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING (WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT,
TORTIOUS CONDUCT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, THE GUARANTY, THE EQUITY COMMITMENT
LETTER, THE DEBT FINANCING OR THE EQUITY FINANCING (INCLUDING ANY SUCH LEGAL
PROCEEDING INVOLVING FINANCING SOURCES). EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (ii) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (iii) IT MAKES THIS WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY; AND (iv) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
9.11_.

 



 

9.12 _Company Disclosure Letter References_. The Parties agree that the
disclosure set forth in any particular section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure Letter will be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a
disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the
corresponding Section or subsection of this Agreement; and (b) any other
representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company
that are set forth in this Agreement, but in the case of this clause (b) only
if the relevance of that disclosure as an exception to (or a disclosure for
purposes of) such other representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure.

 



 

9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement and any amendments hereto may be executed
in one or more counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same
agreement and will become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties, it being
understood that all Parties need not sign the same counterpart. Any such
counterpart, to the extent delivered by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpg or similar
attachment to email (any such delivery, an " **Electronic Delivery** "), will
be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed counterpart and
will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. No Party may raise the
use of an Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature, or the fact that any
signature or agreement or instrument was

 



      
 

 



 

transmitted or communicated through the use of an Electronic Delivery, as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such
defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

 



 

9.14 _No Limitation_. It is the intention of the Parties that, to the extent
possible, unless provisions are mutually exclusive and effect cannot be given
to both or all such provisions, the representations, warranties, covenants and
closing conditions in this Agreement will be construed to be cumulative and
that each representation, warranty, covenant and closing condition in this
Agreement will be given full, separate and independent effect and nothing set
forth in any provision herein will in any way be deemed to limit the scope,
applicability or effect of any other provision hereof.

 



 

9.15 _Performance Guarantee_. Parent hereby guarantees the due, prompt and
faithful performance and discharge by, and compliance with, all of the
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings of Merger Sub under
this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof, including any such
obligations, covenants, terms, conditions and undertakings that are required
to be performed, discharged or complied with following the Effective Time by
the Surviving Corporation.
