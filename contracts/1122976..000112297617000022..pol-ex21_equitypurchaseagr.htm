("Effective Date"), is by and among NLIN Plastics LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company ("Purchaser"), PolyOne Corporation, an Ohio corporation

capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in
Section 11.01(a) of this Agreement.

The Company and DSS Canada (collectively, the "DSS Companies") are engaged in
the Business.

Seller is the record and beneficial owner of 100% of the outstanding equity
interests of the Company (the "Units").

Seller desires to sell, transfer, assign and deliver to Purchaser, and
Purchaser desires to purchase and accept from Seller, all of Seller's right,
title and interest in and to the Units on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.

In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements herein contained, the Parties, intending to be
legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

Article 1 
Purchase and Sale of Units

Section 1.01. Purchase and Sale of Units. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign,
transfer, convey and deliver to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall purchase,
acquire and accept from Seller, all right, title and interest in and to the
Units free and clear of any Liens (other than any applicable restrictions
under the Securities Act and other applicable securities Laws).

Section 1.02. Purchase Price. At the Closing, in consideration for the
transfer by Seller to Purchaser of the Units, Purchaser will pay to Seller an
aggregate purchase price of $115,000,000, in cash (the "Purchase Price"), by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by Seller to Purchaser in accordance with Section 1.04(b)(i). The
Purchase Price will be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.03, Section
1.04 and Section 1.05.

Section 1.03. Estimated Closing Adjustment. Not earlier than 10 days and not
later than three days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and

of such statement, Seller shall cooperate in good faith to answer questions
raised by Purchaser in connection with its review of such statement, consider
in good faith any potential adjustments to such statement raised by Purchaser
in good faith prior to the Closing and, if applicable, update such statement
accordingly; provided that Purchaser's review of and commentary regarding such
statement shall in no way delay or otherwise affect the timing of the Closing.

such dispute within 15 days after Seller notifies Purchaser of its objections,
then the Parties jointly will engage Deloitte (the "Accounting Firm") to
resolve such dispute within 10 days. As promptly as practicable, but in no
event more than 15 days thereafter, the Parties will each prepare and submit a
presentation detailing each Party's complete statement of proposed resolution
of the dispute to the Accounting Firm, and any item not disputed in such
presentation shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties.
Purchaser and Seller will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute as soon as practicable,
but in no event more than 30 days thereafter. The Accounting Firm will
determine the amount of the Final Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final
Transaction Expenses and Final Cash on Hand (in each case, only to the extent
such amounts have been disputed by the Seller pursuant to this Section
1.05(b)) and its final determination will be, in each case, neither more
favorable to Purchaser than the position taken by Purchaser in the Final
Closing Statement, nor more favorable to Seller than the position taken by
Seller in its presentation to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm will
provide a reasoned written calculation of the Final Working Capital, Final
Indebtedness, Final Transaction Expenses and Final Cash on Hand to both
Parties, and absent manifest error or manifest disregard of contractual
language (including the scope of engagement) by the Accounting Firm, the Final
Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final Transaction Expenses and Final Cash
on Hand as so calculated will be final, binding and non-appealable by the
Parties and may be enforced by a court of competent venue and jurisdiction.
The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm will be allocated between
Purchaser and Seller based upon the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to Purchaser and Seller bears to the amount
actually contested by such Party. For example, if the adjustment to the
Estimated Closing Consideration based on Seller's calculation of the Final
Working Capital, Final Indebtedness, Final Transaction Expenses and Final Cash
on Hand is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by Purchaser, and
Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount claimed by Seller, and if the
Accounting Firm ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Seller $300 of the
$500 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration will be allocated
60% (i.e., 300 ÷ 500) to Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to Seller.

(c) Access. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section
1.05, each Party will cooperate with and make available to the other Parties
and their respective Representatives all information, records, data and
working papers, and will during normal business hours permit access to its
facilities and personnel, as may be reasonably required in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Final Closing Statement and the resolution of
any disputes thereunder.

(d) Downward Adjustment. If the Net Adjustment Amount is negative, and the
absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount exceeds $100,000 (the "Collar
Amount"), then the Purchase Price will be adjusted downward by the full amount
of the absolute value of the Net Adjustment Amount, and Seller will pay or
cause to be paid an amount in cash equal to the absolute value of the Net
Adjustment Amount to Purchaser by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to an account or accounts designated in writing by Purchaser to Seller. Any
such payment is to be made within five Business Days of the date on which the
Net Adjustment Amount is finally determined pursuant to Section 1.05(b).

(e) Upward Adjustment. If the Net Adjustment Amount is positive and exceeds
the Collar Amount, then the Purchase Price will be adjusted upward by the full
amount of the Net Adjustment Amount, and Purchaser will pay or cause to be
paid an amount in cash equal to the Net Adjustment Amount to Seller by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by Seller to Purchaser. Any such payment is to be made within five
Business Days of the date on which the Net Adjustment Amount is finally
determined pursuant to Section 1.05(b).

Section 1.06. Withholding. Purchaser and each of its agents and the Company
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it determines
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law; provided,
however with respect to any payment to Seller in exchange for the Units,
excluding any requirement to withhold as a result of the failure of Seller to
deliver the FIRPTA Certificate, that Purchaser will promptly (and, other than
in respect of a later change in Law, in any event no later than 5 Business
Days prior to the date on which such payment is made) notify Seller of any
intention to so deduct and withhold and provide Seller a reasonable
opportunity to promptly provide any statement, form, or other documentation
that would reduce or eliminate any such requirement to deduct and withhold.
Any such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable Person in respect of whom
such deduction and withholding was made.

to consummate the Transactions. Each Transaction Agreement to which Purchaser
is specified to be a party has been or will, at or prior to the Closing, be
duly executed and delivered by Purchaser and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other parties to the Transaction Agreements,
constitutes or will constitute the legal, valid and binding agreement of
Purchaser, enforceable against Purchaser in accordance with its terms, subject
to the General Enforceability Exceptions.

Section 4.03. Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
Purchaser of the Transaction Agreements to which Purchaser is specified to be
a party and the consummation of the Transactions do not and will not (a)
conflict with or violate its Organizational Documents, (b) conflict with or
violate any Law applicable to Purchaser or by which Purchaser or any of
Purchaser's respective properties are bound or require any notice to, consent
of or filing with any Governmental Authority, except for the Required
Regulatory Approval, or (c) require any notice to, consent of or any other
action by any Person under, result in any breach or violation of or constitute
a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become
a default) or result in the loss of a benefit under, or give rise to any right
of termination, cancellation, amendment or acceleration of, any Contract or
permit to which Purchaser is a party or by which Purchaser or any of
Purchaser's respective properties are bound, except, in the cases of clauses
(b) and (c), for any such conflict, violation, breach, default, loss,

right or other occurrence which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions.

Section 4.04. Financial Ability to Perform.

(a) Concurrently with the execution hereof, Purchaser has delivered to the
Company a complete and correct copy of the executed equity commitment letter
(the "Commitment Letter") from Arsenal Capital Partners IV LP (the "Sponsor")
pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions of which, the
Sponsor has agreed to provide certain equity financing (the "Equity
Financing") to Purchaser in connection with the Transactions. The obligation
to fund the commitment under the Commitment Letter is a binding and
enforceable obligation of Purchaser and, to Purchaser's knowledge, the Sponsor
(except as the enforceability thereof may be limited by the General
Enforceability Exceptions) and is not subject to any condition, other than the
conditions expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter
has been duly executed by Purchaser and, to Purchaser's knowledge, the
Sponsor, and the Commitment Letter has not been modified or amended in any
respect as of the date of this Agreement. The proceeds of the Equity Financing
will be sufficient to fund the amounts payable by Purchaser hereunder on the
Closing Date.

(b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser has delivered
to Seller a limited guarantee (the "Guarantee") from the Sponsor guaranteeing
certain of Purchaser's obligations pursuant to this Agreement, subject to the
terms and conditions herein and therein. The Guarantee is a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Sponsor and enforceable (except as the
enforceability thereof may be limited by the General Enforceability
Exceptions) against the Sponsor in accordance with its terms.

Section 4.05. Litigation. There is no Action pending against, or to
Purchaser's Knowledge, threatened against or affecting, Purchaser that in any
manner challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the
Transactions. Purchaser is not subject to any Governmental Order that would
reasonably be expected to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the
Transactions.

Section 4.06. Solvency. Assuming that the Company is Solvent as of the
Closing, the accuracy of the representations and warranties regarding the
Company set forth herein and the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Sections 8.01 and 8.02, after giving effect to the Transactions, Purchaser
will be Solvent as of the Closing and immediately after the consummation of
the Transactions. No transfer of property is being made, and no obligation is
being incurred, in connection with the Transactions with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company.

Section 4.07. Brokers and Finders. In connection with the Transactions and the
Transaction Agreements, there are no Liabilities or claims for brokerage
commissions, finders' fees or similar compensation based on any Contract made
by or on behalf of Purchaser for which Seller or any of its Affiliates
(including, prior to the Closing, the Company) shall be responsible.

Section 4.08. No Additional Representations.

(a) Purchaser acknowledges that it and its Representatives have had a full
opportunity to meet with certain officers and employees of Seller and the
Company to discuss the Business. Purchaser acknowledges that it has conducted
to its satisfaction an independent investigation and verification of the
financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties
and projected operations of the Company and, in making its determination to
proceed with the Transactions, Purchaser has relied solely on the results of
its own independent investigation and verification and the representations and
warranties expressly and specifically set forth in Article 2 and Article 3 and
the representations and warranties expressly and specifically set forth in the
other Transaction Agreements. The representations and warranties expressly and
specifically set forth in Article 2 and Article 3 and the representations and
warranties expressly and specifically set forth in the other Transaction
Agreements constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of
any kind of any of Seller, the Company or any other Person in connection with
the Transactions, and Purchaser understands, acknowledges and agrees that all
other representations and warranties of any kind or nature expressed or
implied (including any relating to the future or historical financial
condition, results of operations, prospects, assets or liabilities of the
Company) are specifically disclaimed. Purchaser acknowledges that (i) none of
Seller, the Company or any other Person has made any representation or
warranty, expressed or implied, as to the Company, the Units, or the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding the Company or the Units
furnished or made available to Purchaser and its Representatives, except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or the
Disclosure Schedule, (ii) Purchaser has not relied on any representation or
warranty from Seller, the Company or any other Person in determining to enter
into this Agreement, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
other Transaction Agreements or the Disclosure Schedule and (iii) none of
Seller, the Company or any other Person will have or be subject to any
Liability to Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the distribution to
Purchaser, or Purchaser's use of, any such information, including any
information, documents or material made available to Purchaser in any "data
rooms" (including the Data Room), management presentations, or other form in
expectation or contemplation of the Transactions, except as expressly and
specifically set forth in this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements or
the Disclosure Schedule.

(b) In connection with the investigation by Purchaser of the Company and the
Units, Purchaser has received or may receive from Seller or the Company
certain projections, forward-looking statements and other forecasts and
certain business plan information. Purchaser acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, that Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties,
that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of
the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts
and plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and that
Purchaser will neither have nor make any claim against anyone with respect
thereto. Accordingly, Purchaser





-29-

acknowledges that none of Seller, the Company or any other Person makes any
representation or warranty with respect to, and Purchaser is not relying on,
such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans (including the reasonableness
of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or
plans).

control and supervision of their operations and businesses, including the

reasonable notice to the personnel, assets, properties, books and records of
the Company and the Business for the purpose of consummating the Transactions
(including for purposes of obtaining insurance for the Business), (ii) furnish

data and other information relating to the Company and the Business as

financial advisors of the Company to cooperate with Purchaser in its

such information and access will be subject to the terms and conditions of the
confidentiality





-32-

agreement, dated March 31, 2017, between Purchaser and Seller (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). To the extent that Seller or its Affiliates
incur any incremental out-of-pocket costs in processing, retrieving or
transmitting any such information pursuant to this Section 5.02, Seller shall
notify Purchaser of such costs prior to incurring such expense and Purchaser
will reimburse Seller for the reasonable out-of-pocket costs thereof promptly
following submission to Purchaser of an invoice therefor accompanied by
reasonable supporting documentation.

(b) From the Effective Date until the Closing, Purchaser will not (and will
direct all of its Affiliates and Representatives to not) contact or
communicate with the employees, consultants, customers, suppliers and
distributors of the Company in connection with the Transactions without
Seller's prior written consent; provided that, (i) to the extent such
interactions involve the Transactions and the continued operation of the
Business following the Closing, Purchaser may contact the senior management
team of the Business, in each case, without the prior written consent of
Seller and (ii) following any public release or announcement concerning the
Transactions, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser to facilitate discussions between Purchaser and the
suppliers of the Business to the extent such discussions involve the continued
operation of the Business following the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Seller
nor its Affiliates will be required to disclose to Purchaser or its
Representatives any information (i) related solely to the sale process of the
Company or Seller's, its Affiliates', or their Representatives' evaluation
thereof, (ii) if doing so would violate any Contract or Law to which Seller or
its Affiliates is a party or is subject or which would result in a loss of the
ability to successfully assert a claim of attorney-client privilege or (iii)
if Seller or its Affiliates reasonably determines in good faith that such
information is competitively sensitive and would reasonably be expected to
cause significant competitive harm to Seller or its Affiliates. In the event
that Seller or any of its Affiliates does not provide access or information in
reliance on clause (ii) or clause (iii) of the previous sentence, Seller shall
notify Purchaser that it is withholding such access or information and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to communicate the applicable information to
Purchaser and its representatives in a way that would not cause competitive
harm, waive such privilege or violate such Contract or Law, including by
cooperating with Purchaser to enable Purchaser and its representatives to
enter into appropriate confidentiality, joint defense or similar agreements or
arrangements so that Purchaser and its representatives may have access to such
information.

Section 5.03. Post-Closing Access to Information. For a period of seven years
from the Closing Date, except as prohibited by applicable Law, Seller and
Purchaser will, subject to compliance by the other Party with the
confidentiality obligations set forth in Section 5.04 and in any Transaction
Agreement, afford to each other and to each other's Representatives reasonable
access and duplicating rights (at the requesting party's expense) during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice to those books and records,
documents and other information within the possession or control of the other
Party or its Affiliates solely to the extent relating to the





-33-

NAI-1502820106v1

* * *





Business, the Company, the Units, or Continuing Employees, insofar as such
access is reasonably required by Seller or Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates for legitimate business reasons (which shall include for purposes
of preparing financial statements, prosecuting or defending any Action, or
preparing Tax returns or any other filing required to be made with any
Governmental Authority, or for purposes of complying with or performing such
Party's obligations under the other Transaction Agreements); provided,
however, that no Party will be required to disclose any such information to
the extent it believes, in good faith, that doing so presents a significant
risk, based on an opinion of counsel, of resulting in a loss of the ability to
successfully assert a claim of attorney-client privilege (in which case the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into appropriate
confidentiality, joint defense or similar agreements or arrangements if
applicable so that the recipient Party may have access to such information);
provided, further, that Seller and its Affiliates will not be required to
provide Purchaser or its Representatives with any information (or the portion
thereof) related to the sale process of the Company by Seller, its Affiliates
or their Representatives.

Section 5.04. Confidentiality. For a period of five years from the Closing
Date, and in perpetuity with respect to trade secrets of the Business, Seller
and Purchaser will hold and cause their respective Affiliates to hold, and
will each use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective members,
managers, officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants,
advisors, representatives and agents (collectively, "Representatives") to
hold, in strict confidence and not disclose or release without the prior
written consent of the other Party, any and all Confidential Information;
provided, that the Parties may disclose, or may permit disclosure of,
Confidential Information without the consent of the other Party (a) to their
respective Representatives who have a need to know such information and are
informed of their obligation to hold such information confidential to the same
extent as is applicable to the Parties and in respect of whose failure to
comply with such obligations Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, will be
responsible or (b) if the Parties, their Affiliates or their Representatives
are compelled to disclose any such Confidential Information by judicial or
administrative process or, in the opinion of independent legal counsel, by
other requirements of Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
any demand or request for disclosure of Confidential Information is made
pursuant to clause (b) above, Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, will
promptly notify the other of the existence of such request or demand and will
provide the other a reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate protective
order or other remedy, which both Parties will reasonably cooperate in
obtaining (at the requesting Party's request and cost). In the event that such
appropriate protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Party who is
required to disclose such Confidential Information will furnish, or cause to
be furnished, only that portion of the Confidential Information that is
legally required to be disclosed.

Section 5.05. Reasonable Best Efforts; Further Assurances.

(a) Each Party will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the
other Parties in doing, all things necessary or desirable under applicable Law
to consummate, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions.

(b) Without limiting the effect of Section 5.05(a), Seller and the Company
will use reasonable best efforts to obtain all authorizations, consents,
approvals and waivers of, and give all notices to, each third party that may
be necessary for the consummation of the Transactions (provided, that, in
connection with obtaining any such authorizations, consents, approvals and
waivers, or the giving of such notices, Seller (i) will not be required to
incur any out-of-pocket costs or any other Liability and (ii) will not have
Liability for failure to obtain such authorizations, consents, approvals or
waivers, or to provide such notices). Purchaser acknowledges that no
representation, warranty or covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement
shall be breached or deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not
satisfied, as a result of the failure to obtain any such authorization,
consent, approval or waiver, or to provide such notice.

(c) From the Effective Date until the Closing Date, each Party will promptly
notify the other Party of any written notice or other written communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person or any Governmental
Authority is or may be required in connection with the Transactions.

(d) Each Party will use reasonable best efforts to (i) prepare, as soon as
practicable, all filings in connection with seeking the Required Regulatory
Approval, and any other exemption or other authorization from any Governmental
Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions; (ii) prosecute such
filings with diligence; (iii) oppose any objections to, appeals from or
petitions to reconsider or reopen any such approval by Persons not party to
this Agreement; (iv) facilitate obtaining any final order or orders approving
the Transactions or to remove any impediment to the consummation of the
Transactions; and (v) furnish all information in connection with the approvals
of or filings with regard to the Required Regulatory Approval with any
Governmental Authority and promptly cooperate with and furnish information in
connection with any such requirements imposed upon Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates in connection with the Transactions. Subject to Section 5.06,
Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Regulatory
Approval, or any exemption thereto, and to remove any impediment imposed by
any Governmental Authority to allow the consummation of the Transactions.
Seller will not have any Liability for the failure to obtain the Required
Regulatory Approval or other consent, approval or authorization of any
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions subject to its
compliance with the terms of this Agreement. Each Party will advise the other
Party promptly of any material communication received by such Party or any of
its Affiliates from the Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, any
state attorney general or any other Governmental Authority regarding any of
the Transactions and of any understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral
or written) such Party proposes to make or enter into with the Federal Trade
Commission, Department of Justice, any state attorney general or any other
Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions. Except as required
by Law, neither Seller nor Purchaser will independently participate in any
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any findings or inquiry
in connection with the Transactions without giving the other prior notice of
the meeting and the opportunity to attend, participate, or both, in each case
unless prohibited by the





-35-

* * *





Governmental Authority. The Parties will consult and cooperate with one
another to the extent permitted by Law in connection with any information or
proposals submitted in connection with proceedings under or relating to the
HSR Act in connection with the Transactions.

(e) Seller will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the
other Parties in doing, all things necessary or desirable under applicable
Law, including but not limited to filing such certificates of merger,
affidavits, or other documents in the real property records of the
jurisdiction in which each respective parcel of Owned Real Property is
located, to cause (i) the removal of any of-record security instruments
encumbering any such Owned Real Property, and (ii) such real property records
to reflect the Company's name as the of-record owner of such Owned Real
Property. Purchaser acknowledges that no representation, warranty or pre-
Closing covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement shall be breached or
deemed breached, and no condition shall be deemed not satisfied, as a result
of the failure to obtain any such authorization, consent, approval or waiver,
or to provide such notice.

Section 5.06. HSR Clearance.

(a) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions set forth in
Section 5.05, each Party will make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the Transactions as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Date and, in any event, no later
than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Date, and make any other
appropriate actions reasonably necessary, proper or required submissions with
respect to the Transactions under the HSR Act and take all other advisable
actions to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (the "HSR Clearance"). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall request, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to obtain, early termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Purchaser will, as promptly as practicable, commit to any and all divestiture,
license, hold-separate or similar agreements with respect to assets or conduct
of business arrangements as a condition to obtaining any and all approvals
from any Governmental Authority for any reason in order to consummate and make
effective, as promptly as practicable, the Transactions, including taking any
and all actions necessary in order to procure that (i) no requirement for non-
action, a waiver, consent or approval of the Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, any State
Attorney General or other Governmental Authority, (ii) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other Governmental Order in any
suit or proceeding and (iii) no other matter relating to any antitrust or
competition Law or regulation would preclude consummation of the Transactions
as promptly as practicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, in no event will any sale or disposition in connection with
obtaining the HSR Clearance

constitute the misrepresentation or breach of any representation, warranty or
covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement if Seller complies with this
Section 5.06.

Section 5.07. Non-Competition; Solicitation of Employees.

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), Seller will not,
and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, (i) subject to
Section 5.07(b), within the United States, Canada or Mexico, (A) engage in the
Restricted Business or (B) manage, operate, own, control or participate in the
ownership, management, operation or control of, any corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, association, trust or other entity or organization
("Business Entity") or subset of any Business Entity that is engaged in the
Restricted Business or (ii) disparage Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in
any way that would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the goodwill,
reputation or business relationships of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
with any of their customers, suppliers, employees or other material business
relations of the Business; provided that in no event will advising or
referring customers in the ordinary course of business as to preferred
partners for specific commercial solutions constitute disparagement in and of
itself.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be prohibited
at any time from:

(i) engaging in any of the businesses of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
existing as of the date hereof, other than the Restricted Business;

(ii) owning or acquiring an interest in (but not participating in the
management or operation of) any mutual fund or similar common investment
vehicle that may own an interest in any Business Entity that engages in all or
a portion of the Restricted Business;

(iii) owning or acquiring, for purposes of passive investment, less than 10%
of (A) any class of securities or (B) the value of any class of indebtedness
of any Business Entity that engages in all or a portion of the Restricted
Business, so long as Seller and its Subsidiaries do not control or participate
in the management or operation of such Business Entity; or

(iv) acquiring the whole or any part of an After-Acquired Business; provided
that Seller or such Subsidiary of Seller will promptly (and in any event
within six months) following the acquisition of such After-Acquired Business
dispose of the assets representing the portion of such After-Acquired Business
that engages in the Restricted Business; provided, further, that Seller and
its Subsidiaries shall not be required to dispose of any assets of an After-
Acquired Business pursuant to this clause (iv) (and shall not be deemed to be
in breach of Section 5.07(a) for failing to dispose of any such assets) if,
whether after





-37-

NAI-1502820106v1

* * *





dispositions of assets or otherwise, (A) less than 25% of the gross revenue of
the After-Acquired Business directly resulted from operations that engaged in
the Restricted Business and (B) less than $15 million of the gross revenue of
the After-Acquired Business directly resulted from operations that engaged in
the Restricted Business (in each case, based on the latest available annual
financial statements of such After-Acquired Business prepared in accordance
with GAAP and determined on a pro forma basis as if the disposition of such
assets had occurred as of the first day of the period covered by such latest
available annual financial statements).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Section
5.07(a) will (i) not apply to any Business Entity or its Subsidiaries that (A)
acquires a majority equity interest in Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or
(B) acquires all or a portion of the business or assets of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, regardless of the form of such transaction; provided that,
for the avoidance of doubt, following any such acquisition, Section 5.07(a)
will continue to apply to Seller, such acquired Subsidiary or such acquired
business or assets in accordance with its terms.

(d) Following the Closing, Seller will not, and will cause its Affiliates not
to, until the end of the five-year period immediately following the Closing
Date, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, solicit any individual
who is either a Continuing Employee or an Employee providing services to the
Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.01(a), in each case with annual base

Insurance Policy. If Purchaser elects to obtain a RandW Insurance Policy, the
RandW Insurance Policy shall provide that the RandW Insurer shall have no right of

case of fraud), and the RandW Insurer has waived any such right of subrogation
(except in the case of fraud). For the avoidance of doubt, (a) Purchaser
obtaining of the RandW Insurance Policy is not a condition to Closing (and shall
not impede or delay the Closing) and Purchaser shall remain obligated, subject
only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8,
to consummate the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
and (b) Purchaser's failure to obtain a RandW Insurance Policy shall in no way
alter or diminish any of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement, and

and shall ensure that the Company does not, amend, repeal or modify any
provision in the Company's Organizational Documents relating to the
exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses of any officers and
directors in any way that diminishes or adversely affects the exculpation,
indemnification or advancement of expenses provided therein (unless required
by applicable Law), it being the intent of the Parties that during such period
the officers and directors of the Company who were officers and directors
prior to the Closing (each, a "DandO Indemnified Person") shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses to
the full extent provided for under applicable Law and in the Company's
Organizational Documents as of immediately prior to the Closing.

(b) To the extent provided for in the Company's Organizational Documents and

Indemnified Persons against all DandO Expenses (as defined below), losses,
claims, damages,





-41-

NAI-1502820106v1

* * *





judgments or amounts paid in any settlement consented to by the Company
(collectively, "DandO Costs") in respect of any threatened, pending or completed
Action to the extent based on or arising out or relating to the fact that such
Person is or was a director or officer of the Company and arising out of acts
or omissions occurring on or prior to the Closing (including in respect of
acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions) (a
"DandO Indemnifiable Claim") and (ii) advance to such DandO Indemnified Persons
all DandO Expenses incurred in connection with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim
(including in circumstances where the DandO Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense of such claim) promptly after receipt of reasonably detailed
statements therefor; provided, however, that the DandO Indemnified Person to
whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides a written undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such DandO Indemnified Person
is not entitled to indemnification. To the extent provided for in the
Company's Organizational Documents, any DandO Indemnifiable Claims shall
continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is disposed of or all judgments,
orders, decrees or other rulings in connection with such DandO Indemnifiable
Claim are fully satisfied. For the purposes of this Section 5.13(b), "DandO
Expenses" means reasonable and documented attorneys' fees and all other
reasonable, documented and out-of-pocket costs, charges and expenses paid or
incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or
participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness
in or participate in any DandO Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude losses,
claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in settlement (which items are, for
the avoidance of doubt, included in the definition of DandO Costs).

(c) At the Closing, and in full satisfaction of Purchaser's other obligations
pursuant to Section 5.13(a) and (b), Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
Company to, obtain, maintain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail" insurance
policies naming the DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries, with a
claims period of at least six years from the Closing Date, in an amount and
scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing policies, but in no
event with a liability limit in excess of $10,000,000, with respect to matters
existing or occurring on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser shall not,
and shall cause the Company not to, cancel or change such insurance policies
in any respect.

(d) In the event Purchaser, the Company, or any of their respective successors
or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in either such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Purchaser or the Company, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.13. The
provisions of this Section 5.13 shall survive the consummation of the
Transactions and are expressly intended to benefit each of the DandO Indemnified
Persons.

conduct and control, and shall prosecute and defend, all aspects of the

prosecution of the Applicable Case (including selection of counsel); provided,
that Seller shall not be permitted to take any action that would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company without the prior
written consent of Purchaser (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Without limiting the foregoing, Seller may (a) pursue
or forgo any and all appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with any
Governmental Authority with respect thereto and (b) pay, settle or compromise
any aspect of the Applicable Case without the written consent of Purchaser;
provided, that Seller shall not settle or compromise any aspect of the
Applicable Case in a manner that results in (i) limiting the Company's right
to make, use or sell the allegedly infringing product or (ii) the Company
making any payments (including damages or royalties) or otherwise admitting
any Liability to the counterparty in the Applicable Case, in each case,
without Purchaser's consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). Without limiting the discretion of Seller to conduct
and control the Applicable Case as provided herein, Seller shall, at Seller's
cost and expense, keep Purchaser reasonably informed of any material
developments with respect thereto. Purchaser shall, at Seller's expense,
reasonably cooperate in good faith in the prosecution and defense of the

commercially reasonable efforts to effect the separation of each Shared
Contract and Joint Contract set forth on Schedule 5.16, such that the Company
shall be a party to a separate agreement directly with the relevant third
party(ies). To the extent any Shared Contract has not been separated prior to
the Closing as described in the preceding sentence, then (i) the Company shall
be entitled to the benefits of the portion of any such Shared Contract
relating to the Business accruing on or after the Closing to the extent (and
only to the extent) that Seller can provide such benefits (A) without
violating the express terms of any such Shared Contract, and (B) without
incurring any material expense that the Company does not agree to promptly
reimburse or which is not otherwise reimbursed or paid pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement or otherwise taking any material actions or
measures outside of the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice (including, but not limited to, hiring additional employees), and
(ii) the Company shall perform, at its sole expense, the obligations of Seller
(or Seller's applicable Affiliate) to be performed after the Closing under the
express terms of any such Shared Contract, solely to the extent related to
portion of such Shared Contract that relates to the Business. It is understood

comments thereto.

(f) Prior to the conduct of any investigation, remedial action, monitoring or
post-closure care by Seller after the Closing, Purchaser shall cause the
Company to enter into a reasonable and customary access agreement with Seller
that grants to Seller and its consultants and contractors the right to enter
upon the Owned Stamford Facility and New Jersey Facilities upon reasonable
advance notice in order to perform or monitor the work necessary for Seller to
comply with its CTA or ISRA obligations hereunder (the "Work"). Pursuant to
such access agreement, Seller shall take commercially reasonable steps to
avoid unreasonably interfering with the operations of the Company at such Real
Property. If any portion of such Real Property suffers any damage caused by
Seller or its consultants or contractors pursuant to this access, including
damage arising from sampling or testing conducted at such Real Property,
Seller shall reasonably repair such damage and restore such Real Property
substantially to the condition that existed immediately prior to such damage.

such other Person and its successors and assigns grant to Seller the same
right of access set forth in this Section 5.18(f) and require such Person to

cooperate with Seller to minimize costs incurred by Seller associated with
Seller's CTA and ISRA obligations hereunder, including accepting Land Use
Covenants and/or Land Use Restrictions permitted by and consistent with the
CTA and ISRA and executing and recording related deed notices and otherwise
executing and recording all appropriate documents in connection therewith as
Seller may reasonably request; provided, that such Land Use Covenants and/or
Land Use Restrictions do not materially interfere with the continued
utilization of the Real Property for industrial or commercial uses (including

responsible to Purchaser or the Company or any of their agents, contractors,
licensees or invitees (other than Seller and its contractors and agents), and

an amount equal to the proceeds received by the Company pursuant to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Wichita Real Estate
Purchase Agreement (less any costs or expenses (including Taxes) incurred by
Purchaser or the Company in connection therewith) as promptly as practicable

be asserted against any the Company after the Closing Date arising out of
events, incidents, conduct or circumstances that occurred prior to the Closing
Date (such claims, "Post-Closing Claims"), the Company may tender such Post-
Closing Claim to Seller for submission by Seller or one of its Affiliates to
the applicable insurer under any of the occurrence-based insurance policies of
Seller or its Affiliates or their predecessors issued prior to the Closing
Date under which the Company or its predecessors were insured or potentially
insured as of the date of the events, incidents, conduct or circumstances
giving rise to such Post-Closing Claim (such policies, the "Pre-Closing
Occurrence Based Policies" and each such claim a "Noticed Post-Closing
Claim"), and Seller shall thereupon tender, or cause one of its Affiliates to
tender, such Post-Closing Claim to the applicable insurer for coverage;
provided, however, that (a) nothing herein shall diminish or affect any right
of the Company under such Pre-Closing Occurrence Based Policies to tender any
Post-Closing Claims directly to the applicable insurer should Seller fail or
refuse to do so for any reason; and (b) the Company shall have no recourse to
Seller for any uninsured or uncovered amounts for such Post-Closing Claims
(including any deductible or other amount for which Seller provides self-
insurance), except for amounts attributable to any failure or refusal by
Seller to provide timely notice of any Noticed Post-Closing Claim to the
applicable insurer upon Seller's receipt of notice of such Noticed Post-
Closing Claim from the Company. Seller shall notify Purchaser and the Company
of all coverage determinations made by the insurer(s) in respect of any Post-
Closing Claims and, if any amounts are paid or to be paid by the insurer in
respect thereof, shall request that such insurer make payment directly to the
Company, or shall transfer such insurance proceeds to the Company, as the case
may be, no later than ten (10) days after receipt of such insurance proceeds.
Seller shall not release, commute, buy-back or otherwise eliminate the
coverage available under any Pre-Closing Occurrence Based Policy without
Purchaser's consent.

(ii) Taxes (other than Taxes described in clause (i) of this Section 6.02)
will be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax
Period on a per diem basis. Seller will be responsible for the portion of
Taxes for a Straddle Period allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
Purchaser will be responsible for the portion of Taxes for a Straddle Period
allocable to the Post-Closing Tax Period. Seller shall promptly pay to
Purchaser an amount equal to any Taxes shown as due on any Seller Prepared Tax

Section 6.03. Tax Treatment; Allocation of Purchase Price. For U.S. federal
and applicable state income tax purposes, Purchaser and Seller agree to, and
agree to cause their Affiliates to, treat (i) the acquisition of the Units as

Canadian NewCo as a taxable transfer of the Canadian Purchased Assets to the
Canadian NewCo in exchange for the stock of the Canadian NewCo. The Purchase
Price (and other relevant amounts for U.S. federal income and other applicable

pursuant to the Wichita Real Estate Purchase Agreement) will be allocated
among the assets of the Company in accordance with section 1060 of the Code

Price allocable to the property to be sold pursuant to the Wichita Real Estate
Purchase

Agreement shall be equal to the amount to be received by the Company in
exchange therefor pursuant to the Wichita Real Estate Purchase Agreement ( the
"Allocation"). Within 60 days of the determination of the final Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 1.05, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver the Allocation
to the Seller for Seller's review and comment. Seller will have 20 days from
the receipt of such draft Allocation to provide Purchaser with written
comments. The Parties shall work in good faith for 15 days to resolve any
disputes. Any dispute with respect to the Allocation that is not resolved in
such 15-day period shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm for resolution.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Parties in
accordance with Section 1.05(b). The Accounting Firm shall resolve any
disputed matters as promptly as practicable, and the Accounting Firm's
decision with respect to any such matters shall be conclusive and binding on
Seller, Purchaser and their respective Affiliates for applicable Tax purposes.
The Parties will file, and will cause their Affiliates to file, all Tax
Returns (including IRS Form 8594) consistent with the Allocation and the

penalties or additions to Tax attributable to such Taxes, levies, charges or
fees (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes") will be borne solely by Purchaser.
The Party required by Law to file any Tax Returns and documentation related to
Transfer Taxes will prepare and file such Tax Returns and documentation and
Purchaser and Seller will reasonably cooperate to reduce or eliminate Transfer
Taxes to the extent permitted by applicable Law. If Seller is required to pay
any Transfer Taxes, including pursuant to a post-Closing assessment by a
Taxing Authority, Purchaser will reimburse Seller for the amount of such
Transfer Tax as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 14 days of
Seller's written demand).

(a) Seller, at its own expense, shall prepare and timely file prior to the
Closing Date, or cause to be prepared and timely filed prior to the Closing
Date, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company that are required to

Closing Date ("Seller Prepared Tax Returns"). Seller shall prepare such Tax
Returns consistent with past practices, except to the extent otherwise
required by Law, and shall deliver to Purchaser any such Tax Returns for
Purchaser's review and comment at least 20 days prior to the due date of such
Tax Return (or, in the case of non-income Tax Returns, such shorter period as
circumstances may require) (taking into account any applicable extensions) and
Seller shall consider in good faith all reasonable comments of Purchaser that
are submitted no less than 10 days prior to such due date.

(b) Purchaser, at its own expense, shall prepare and timely file, or cause to
be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the

extensions of time to file) is after the Closing Date or for any Straddle
Period ("Purchaser Prepared Tax Returns"). Purchaser shall prepare Purchaser
Prepared Tax Returns consistent with past practices, except to the extent
otherwise required by Law and shall deliver to Seller any such Purchaser
Prepared Tax Returns for Seller's review and comment at least 20 days prior to
the due date of such Tax Return (or, in the case of non income Tax Returns,
such shorter period as circumstances may require) (taking into account any
applicable extensions), and Purchaser shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments of Seller that are submitted no less than 10 days prior to
such due date.

Section 6.06. Seller Tax Returns. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Seller shall control the preparation and
filing of all U.S. federal (and applicable state and local) income Tax Returns
of Seller and its Affiliates and the preparation, prosecution and defense of

local) income Taxes of Seller and its Affiliates, and Purchaser shall have no
rights with respect thereto.

otherwise required by applicable Law.

ARTICLE 7 
Employees and Employee Benefits

Section 7.01. Employees.

(a) Schedule 7.01(a) sets forth a list of all Employees, together with their
job position/title, base salary and/or hourly wage rates, and any other
targeted or mandatory cash compensation and any other relevant information,
including bonus levels and job classification, where applicable. From and
after the Closing and until the termination of all payroll and employee
benefits services pursuant to the Secondment Agreement (such period, the
"Employee Lease Term"), Seller will make available to Purchaser the services
of the Employees to work for Purchaser in the positions detailed in Schedule
7.01(a). For so long as any Employee is providing services hereunder, he/she
shall perform such services as Purchaser shall from time-to-time reasonably
request and direct. Seller shall direct each such Employee to perform his/her
duties honestly, diligently, competently, in good faith, and for the benefit
of Purchaser, and Seller shall take no action inconsistent therewith. For so
long as any Employee is providing the foregoing services hereunder, Seller
shall ensure that he/she shall not perform any services for any Person
(including Seller) other than Purchaser and its Affiliates. Seller will
instruct the Employees to provide to Purchaser the services and perform those
duties that such

individuals provided to the Company prior to the Closing (subject to
reasonable modifications to such duties and responsibilities as requested by
Purchaser), to conform to Purchaser's and its Affiliates' policies regarding
safety and health, labor and employment, personal and professional conduct and
to otherwise conduct themselves in a businesslike manner. Except as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement or requested by Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates, Seller and its Affiliates shall not change the employment
status, description, duties, reporting requirements or location of employment
for any Employee. Purchaser and its Affiliates and their respective management
shall have the exclusive right to direct and assign and structure work for the
Employees during the Employee Lease Term. In the event that Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates has a concern about an Employee's performance or job conduct
during the Employee Lease Term, Seller and its Affiliates will cooperate in
providing Purchaser with documents and information relating to the Employee's
performance and other employment matters to the extent Seller or any of its
Affiliates has such documents and information and to the extent permitted by
Law. During the Employee Lease Term and pursuant to the Secondment Agreement,
Seller or its Affiliates shall (i) provide timekeeping and payroll services
for the Employees, including the following: semi-monthly, bi-weekly or monthly
payroll, as applicable; payroll tax deductions and filings, including
deductions and payments for income and Social Security tax requirements under
federal, state and local Laws; personnel record maintenance; insurance
withholdings; employment eligibility verification; retirement plan processing;
and annual W-2 forms; (ii) make available to the Employees equivalent employee
benefit and fringe benefit plans and arrangements that are provided from time
to time by Seller to its equivalent level other similarly situated employees;
and (iii) continue to pay the Employees their salary or wage as detailed in
Schedule 7.01(a) and provide benefits as contemplated hereby, in each case
subject to changes approved by Purchaser in writing; provided, however, that
Seller shall make no award of equity or equity-based compensation to any
Employee listed on Schedule 7.01(a). Purchaser shall (or shall cause the
Company to) reimburse Seller an amount equal to the total cost for all
compensation (including annual salary, annual bonus and other incentive
compensation, but not equity compensation) and benefits (including paid time
off or vacation that occurs during the Employee Lease Term) for the Employees
incurred during the Employee Lease Term (the "Employee Costs"). Seller shall
supply Purchaser with an invoice on each payroll date (which is currently done
on a bi-weekly basis) for all Employee Costs related to salary, wages,
commissions overtime, vacation and other paid leave, and incentive payments,
and an invoice on a monthly basis with respect all Employee Costs related to
benefits, employee taxes, administrative costs, and workers' compensation and
similar claims. Purchaser shall (or shall cause the Company to) pay the
invoiced amount no later than five (5) days following receipt of such invoice;
provided, however, that if Purchaser disagrees in good faith with any such
charge, Purchaser shall send written notification to Seller specifying the
reason for such disagreement (but Purchaser shall (or shall cause the Company
to) pay any part of the invoiced amount with which it does not disagree) and
Purchaser and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to promptly resolve any
such disagreement. For the purposes of federal and state employee income and
related Tax filings, Seller and its applicable Affiliates shall accurately
report and remit such taxes to federal and state authorities as are due and
payable for the periods





-51-

NAI-1502820106v1

* * *





for which Seller or any of its Affiliates paid payroll to the Employees. All
applicable compensation paid during such period by Seller or any of its
Affiliates shall be reported, and related Taxes remitted, to the tax
authorities by Seller or any of its Affiliates under its federal employer
identification number. Purchaser shall (or shall cause the Company to)
reimburse Seller for all federal, state and local payroll Taxes as Employee
Costs in accordance with this Section 7.01(a). During the Employee Lease Term
and for a period of one (1) year thereafter, Purchaser and its Affiliates
and/or agents shall have the right, on reasonable notice, during normal
business hours and no more than twice per year, to inspect, audit, and analyze
all of the books, accounts, and records of Seller and its Affiliates
pertaining to the Employees and the Employee Costs for the sole purpose of
verifying the amounts invoiced to Purchaser hereunder. Purchaser shall bear
the cost of any inspection and audit unless the inspection reveals that Seller
or any of its Affiliates overbilled Purchaser by two and one-half percent
(2.5%) or more with respect to any period being audited, in which case Seller
shall bear the costs of such inspection and audit. Purchaser and Seller shall
cause their respective Affiliates to comply with Purchaser\'s and Seller\'s
respective obligations under this Section 7.01(a) to the extent necessary to
effectuate the provisions of this Section 7.01(a), and the Company and, to the
extent necessary the Canadian NewCo shall be entitled to the rights of
Purchaser under this Section 7.01(a).

(b) On the last day of the Employee Lease Term (the "Employee Transfer Date"),
Seller shall cause the termination of employment of all Employees set forth on
Schedule 7.01(a), except for the Excluded Employees and any Employees who are,
as of such date, absent from employment due to a leave of absence, disability
or short or long term absence due to illness or injury. No later than five (5)
Business Days prior to the Employee Transfer Date, Seller shall provide to
Purchaser a complete and accurate list (the "Employee List") of (i) all
individuals who are, as of the date of delivery of the Employee List,
Employees and (ii) all Employees who, as of the date of delivery of the
Employee List, are absent from employment due to a leave of absence,
disability or short or long term absence due to illness or injury (the
"Inactive Employees"). At least one Business Day prior to the Employee
Transfer Date, the Company shall provide to Seller a list of any Employees who
will not be offered employment with the Company or its Affiliates (such
individuals (the "Excluded Employees"); provided that the Company and its
Affiliates shall offer employment to substantially all of the Employees not
designated as manufacturing employees (as defined in the Job Function column
to Exhibit A to the Amended and Restated Secondment Agreement) set forth on
Schedule 7.01(a); provided further, that Purchaser may designate any
manufacturing employees (as defined in the "Job Function" column to Exhibit A
to the Amended and Restated Secondment Agreement) as Excluded Employees,
subject to Section 5.08 herein; provided further, that Purchaser may designate
the individuals identified on Schedule 7.01(b) as Excluded Employees.
Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date, the Company shall (or shall cause
one of its Affiliates to) offer employment to all Employees other than the
Excluded Employees and any Inactive Employees as of such date (each such
Employee offered employment, an "In-scope Employee"). Each In-Scope Employee
who is offered employment, accepts the offer of employment and actually





-52-

NAI-1502820106v1

* * *





commences employment on a later date in accordance with this section with the
Company or one of its Affiliates shall be referred to as a "Continuing
Employee." Any Excluded Employees and Inactive Employees shall remain employed
by Seller or its Affiliates and will continue to be eligible to receive
benefits under the Employee Plans, and, Seller shall continue to be
responsible for all Liabilities related to the Excluded Employees and Inactive
Employees (except with respect to any outstanding, undisputed Employee Costs
and except to the extent of Section 5.08 herein). To the extent any Inactive
Employee subsequently presents himself or herself to the Company for active
employment within a period of six (6) months following the Employee Transfer
Date, the Company will (or will cause one of its Affiliates to) make an offer
of employment to such Inactive Employee. An Inactive Employee who accepts such
offer employment and actually commences active employment on a later date in
accordance with this section with the Company or one of its Affiliates shall
become a Continuing Employee on the date he or she returns to active
employment and any obligations of the Company or its Affiliates shall not
commence until such return to active employment with the Company or such
Affiliate. For a period of six (6) months following Closing (or, if earlier,
until the termination of employment of the relevant Continuing Employee),
Purchaser shall cause the Continuing Employees to be employed on terms and
conditions that are, at a minimum, substantially similar to those in effect
with respect to such Continuing Employees as in effect immediately before the
Employee Transfer Date, providing for base salary or hourly wage rate and cash
incentive compensation opportunities and benefits (excluding equity or equity-
based, defined benefit pension, nonqualified or deferred compensation and
retiree welfare benefits) substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
base salary or hourly wage rate and cash incentive compensation opportunities
and benefits (excluding equity or equity-based, defined benefit pension,
nonqualified or deferred compensation and retiree welfare benefits) that were
in effect with respect to the Continuing Employees immediately before the
Employee Transfer Date. Nothing contained in this Section 7.01(b) shall be
deemed to be a guarantee of employment or particular term or condition of
employment of any Person with Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates, including any Continuing Employee.

Section 7.02. Purchaser Benefit Plans.

(a) Purchaser will cause all plans and programs of Purchaser and its
Affiliates to recognize all service of the Continuing Employees with Seller,
the Company or any of its predecessors and Affiliates to the same extent and
for the same purposes thereunder as such service was counted under the
analogous Employee Plan in effect immediately prior to the Employee Transfer
Date, for purposes of eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual and determining
the level of vacation and severance benefits under any benefit or compensation
plan, program, policy or agreement made available to Continuing Employees on
or after the Employee Transfer Date occurs (excluding any equity or equity-
based, defined benefit pension, nonqualified or deferred compensation or
retiree welfare benefits) (except that such service will not be counted to the
extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits or compensation for
the same period of service). With respect to any medical, dental or health
plan of Purchaser, the Company, or any of their





-53-

NAI-1502820106v1

* * *





respective Affiliates that is made available to Continuing Employees following
the Employee Transfer Date (a "Purchaser Group Health Plan"), in the calendar
year in which the Employee Transfer Date occurs, Purchaser will use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Company to not include with
respect to any Continuing Employee any restrictions or limitations with
respect to pre-existing condition exclusions or any actively-at-work
requirements (except to the extent such restrictions or limitations were
applicable as of the Employee Transfer Date under any similar plans of Seller,
the Company or any of their Affiliates (a "Seller Group Health Plan")), and
any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of such Seller Group
Health Plan ending on the date such Continuing Employee's participation in
such Purchaser Group Health Plan begins will be taken into account under the
Purchaser Group Health Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such analogous amounts had been paid in accordance with such
Purchaser Group Health Plan in effect immediately prior to the Employee
Transfer Date.

(b) Unless otherwise agreed between Seller and Purchaser, or pursuant to any
transition welfare benefit coverage agreement between Seller and Purchaser,
coverage for all Continuing Employees and their spouses and dependents under
the Employee Plans that are sponsored and maintained by Seller will cease to
be effective from and after the Employee Transfer Date, and with respect to
all such Employee Plans, other with respect to any Company Plans, Seller shall
take all actions necessary to amend all such Employee Plans to remove the DDS
Companies as participating employers, effective as of the Closing Date, and
Seller shall be responsible for and shall perform and discharge, or cause to
be performed and discharge, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser
and its Affiliates from and against (1) subject to Purchaser's reimbursement
obligation under Section 7.01(a), all accrued compensation due to any
Continuing Employee for the period of their employment with Seller or its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company) until the Employee Transfer Date, (2)
the sponsorship of and all Liabilities under or with respect to any Employee
Plans (other than Company Plans), including those Liabilities incurred or
claimed in respect of any Continuing Employees or their covered dependents for
benefits or claims made by any current or former employees of the Company
prior to the Employee Transfer Date and (3) any Liabilities arising out of any
claims made by any current or former employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries
(other than the Company) related to such employee's period of employment or
service with Seller or one of its Subsidiaries prior to the Employee Transfer
Date. Seller shall retain responsibility for all medical, dental and vision
expenses and all other welfare plan expenses incurred by current or former
employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries under the Employee Plans (other than a
Company Plan) regardless of when incurred or reported.

(c) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company shall (i) transfer the
sponsorship of and the assets and liabilities maintained pursuant or with
respect to the Spartech Corporation 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan (the
"Company Savings Plan") to Seller and (ii) remove the Company as a
participating employer in the Company

Savings Plan, in each case, to be effective at least one day prior to the
Closing (the "CSP Transfer Date"). Effective as of the CSP Transfer Date, the
Seller shall maintain, operate, fund and administer the Company Savings Plan
and any related trust, Contract or fund, in material compliance with its terms
and any related documents or agreements and in material compliance with all
applicable Laws. Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser will
cover (or cause to be covered) each Continuing Employee, other than an
Employee of DSS Canada, under one or more tax-qualified defined contribution
plans that are intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (the
"Purchaser's Savings Plans"). In addition, Purchaser will cause one or more
Purchaser Savings Plans to accept a direct rollover or an eligible rollover of
all or a portion of a distribution of the account balance, including any
outstanding loan, from the Company Savings Plan and the PolyOne Corporation
Retirement Savings Plan (the "PolyOne Savings Plan") of each Continuing
Employee who is a participant thereunder as a rollover contribution; provided,
however, that Purchaser's Savings Plans will only be required to accept
rollovers of outstanding loans during the 180-day period following the
Employee Transfer Date. Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date Seller will
take all necessary actions to: (1) amend the loan procedures of the Company
Savings Plan and the PolyOne Savings Plan, if necessary, to permit U.S.
Continuing Employees to continue to make payments of any outstanding loan
under such plan during the 180-day period following the Employee Transfer
Date; (2) provide full vesting of all amounts credited to account of any U.S.
Continuing Employee under the Company Savings Plan and PolyOne Savings Plan or
any other retirement plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code , as applicable; and (3) make the matching, profit sharing and any other
employer contributions to the Company Savings Plan, PolyOne Savings Plan or
any other retirement plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code on behalf of U.S. Continuing Employees, prorated for the portion of the
plan year ending on the Employee Transfer Date; provided, however, that such
employer contributions to the Company Savings Plan, PolyOne Savings Plan or
any other retirement plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code will be made as soon as reasonably practicable following the Employee
Transfer Date. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 7.02, to
the extent that prior to the Closing Date any non-Continuing Employees (or any
spouses or dependents thereof) participate in, or any other entity other than
the Company is a participating employer of, any Company Plans (but excluding
the Company Savings Plan), effective no later than the day prior to the
Closing Date, such employees and entities shall cease participating in the
Company Plans (but excluding the Company Savings Plan), and Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the DSS Companies) shall take all necessary action to
cause the Company to amend such Company Plans to remove the non-Continuing
Employees (or spouses and dependents thereof) as participants and all other
entities other than the Company as participating employers, and Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the DSS Companies) shall enroll such employees in
Employee Plans sponsored by the Seller (and, for the avoidance of doubt,
excluding the Company Plans).

(d) Purchaser will credit each Continuing Employee with the unused, accrued
vacation, sick leave or personal days to which the Continuing Employee is
entitled through the Employee Transfer Date.

(e) Effective as of the Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser will maintain or
establish a flexible spending account plan ("Purchaser's Flexible Spending
Account Plan") providing for medical and dependent care flexible spending
account arrangements for the benefit of Continuing Employees which will
recognize the elections that such Continuing Employees had in effect for
purposes of the plan year in which the Employee Transfer Date occurs under the
medical and dependent care flexible spending account arrangements under the
flexible spending account plan of Seller ("Seller's Flexible Spending Account
Plan"). As soon as practicable after the Employee Transfer Date, Purchaser
will cause Purchaser's Flexible Spending Account Plan to assume the account
balances associated with the Continuing Employees' flexible spending accounts
under Seller's Flexible Spending Account Plan. After the Employee Transfer
Date, Purchaser's Flexible Spending Account Plan will be responsible for
reimbursement of all previously unreimbursed reimbursable medical claims
incurred by Continuing Employees in Seller's plan year in which the Employee
Transfer Date occurs. With respect to any Continuing Employees who have
account balances under the Seller's Flexible Spending Account Plan, as soon as
reasonably practicable following the Employee Transfer Date, or after the end
of any welfare benefit transition coverage period, Seller's will transfer to
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, assets equal to
the total account balances outstanding, along with any records or information
necessary to administer the Purchaser's Flexible Spending Account Plan.

(f) Purchaser will have the sole responsibility after the Employee Transfer
Date for "continuation coverage" benefits provided after the Employee Transfer
Date for all Continuing Employees and "qualified beneficiaries" of Continuing
Employees for whom a "qualifying event" occurred after the Employee Transfer
Date, except that Seller will assume or retain such responsibility or
obligations with respect to U.S. Continuing Employees and other qualified
beneficiaries: (1) who are enrolled in COBRA continuation coverage under a
Seller Group Health Plan as of the Employee Transfer Date or (B) with respect
to whom a qualifying event occurred on or prior to the Employee Transfer Date.
The terms "continuation coverage," "qualified beneficiaries" and "qualifying
event" will have the meanings ascribed to them under section 4980B of the Code
and sections 601-608 of ERISA.

Section 7.03. Workers Compensation Claims. As of the Employee Transfer Date,
Purchaser will, or will cause one of its Affiliates to, (i) be solely
responsible for the costs and administration of any and all workers'
compensation claims of any Continuing Employee (including (x) injuries that

sustained on or before the Employee Transfer Date, regardless of whether such
claims are filed by such Continuing Employee before or after the Employee
Transfer Date, (y) injuries identifiably sustained by Continuing Employees
after the Employee Transfer Date that are aggravations or reinjuries of
injuries or illnesses that were sustained on or before the

required by Continuing Employees following complete recovery from injuries
sustained on or before the Employee Transfer Date) and (ii) establish and
maintain appropriate workers' compensation insurance with respect to claims

Affiliates (other than the DSS Companies) to continue to timely make any and
all payments to or with respect to, and to satisfy any and all obligations
with respect to any withdrawal liability that was assessed by an MEPP prior to

Section 7.05. No Third Party Beneficiaries. No provision of this Article 7
will create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or
former employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller or
Purchaser or any other Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and assigns, or constitute or create an employment agreement. No
provisions of this Article 7 (i) shall be construed to establish, amend or
modify any Employee Plan, Foreign Plan or Company Plan, or any other benefit
or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) shall limit
the ability of Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to
amend, modify, or terminate any benefit or compensation plan, program,
agreement or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them.

NAI-1502820106v1

* * *





(b) by either Seller or Purchaser if the Closing will not have been
consummated on or before October 27, 2017 (the "Termination Date"); provided,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01 will
not be available to the Party seeking to terminate if any action of such Party
or the failure of such Party to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement required to be performed at or prior to the Closing has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
Termination Date and such action or failure to perform constitutes a breach of
this Agreement;

(c) by Seller or the Company if there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 8.03(a) would not be
satisfied, and such breach has not been cured prior to the earlier of (i) 10
Business Days following notice of such breach and (ii) the Termination Date;
or

(d) by Purchaser if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement on the part of Seller or the Company contained in this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in Section 8.02(a) would not be
satisfied, and such breach has not been cured prior to the earlier of (i) 10
Business Days following notice of such breach and (ii) the Termination Date.

Section 9.02. Method of Termination. In the event of termination by any Party
pursuant to Section 9.01, the terminating Party will give the other Parties

permitted by Section 9.01, such termination will be without Liability of any
Party (or any equityholder, director, officer, employee, agent, consultant or

provided, that nothing in this Agreement will relieve any Party from Liability

(b) The Seller Indemnified Parties will not be entitled to assert any
indemnification under Section 10.03(a) after the expiration of the applicable
survival period pursuant to Section 10.01, except that if, on or prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period, a notice of claim will have been
given to Purchaser pursuant to Section 10.04(a) for such indemnification, the
survival period with respect to such claim shall be tolled, and the Seller
Indemnified Parties will continue to have the right to be indemnified with
respect to such indemnification claim until such claim for indemnification has
been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this Article 10.

(c) Any indemnification of a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to this Article

funds from Purchaser to an account or accounts designated by the applicable
Seller Indemnified Party to Purchaser within 15 days after the final
determination thereof.

Section 10.04. Procedures Relating to Indemnification.

(a) In order for an indemnified party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Article 10 in respect of, arising out of or involving
a claim or demand made by any Person (other than a Party or Affiliate thereof)
against the indemnified party (a "Third-Party Claim"), such indemnified party
must notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in reasonable detail, of
the Third-Party Claim as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt by
such indemnified party of written notice of the Third-Party Claim, except that
failure to give such notification will not affect the indemnification provided
under this Agreement except to the extent the indemnifying party is actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure. The indemnified party will deliver to
the indemnifying party, within five Business Days after the indemnified
party's receipt thereof, copies of all material notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the indemnified party relating to the
Third-Party Claim.

(b) If a Third-Party Claim that is exclusively for civil monetary damages
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement is made against an indemnified party,
and if the indemnifying party acknowledges in writing its obligation to
indemnify the indemnified party against any and all Covered Losses that may
result from such Third-Party Claim, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate in the defense thereof and, if it so chooses, to assume the
defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party at the expense of the indemnifying party
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume the defense of any Third Party Claim for equitable relief or any claim
that would impose criminal liability or damages, and the indemnified party
shall have the right to defend, at the expense of the indemnifying party, any
such Third Party Claim. Should the





-61-

NAI-1502820106v1

* * *





indemnifying party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for legal
expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof, unless (i) the employment of such counsel shall have been
specifically authorized in writing by the indemnifying party or (ii) the named
parties to the Third-Party Claim (including any impleaded parties) include
both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party, and the indemnified
party reasonably determines that representation by counsel to the indemnifying
party of both the indemnifying party and such indemnified party may present
such counsel with a conflict of interest. If the indemnifying party assumes
such defense, the indemnified party will have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense (except as provided
in the immediately preceding sentence), separate from the counsel employed by
the indemnifying party, it being understood, however, that the indemnifying
party shall control such defense. The indemnifying party will be liable for
the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the indemnified party for any
period during which the indemnifying party has not assumed the defense
thereof. If the indemnifying party chooses to defend any Third-Party Claim,
all the Parties will cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such
cooperation will include the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's
request) the provision to the indemnifying party of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and the use of
reasonable efforts to make employees available on a mutually convenient basis,
without charge, to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided under this Section 10.04(b). Whether or not the indemnifying
party will have assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, neither the
indemnified party nor any of its Affiliates will admit any Liability with
respect to, consent to the entry of judgment, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the indemnifying party's prior
written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). If the
indemnifying party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, the
indemnifying party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified party, enter into any settlement or compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to such Third-Party Claim if such
settlement, compromise or judgment (i) does not include an unconditional
written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the indemnified party from all
liability in respect of such Third‑Party Claim, (ii) subjects the indemnified
party to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy, other than solely
the payment of money damages for which the indemnified party will be
indemnified hereunder, or (iii) includes a statement or admission of fault,
culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

(c) If any indemnified party desires to assert any claim for indemnification
provided under this Article 10 other than a claim in respect of, arising out
of or involving a Third-Party Claim, such indemnified party will notify the
indemnifying party in writing, and in reasonable detail (taking into account
the information then available to such indemnified party), of such claim
promptly after becoming aware of the existence of such claim, except that the
failure of an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party will relieve
the indemnifying party from its obligation to indemnify only to the extent
that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure.

(d) Mitigation. Purchaser and Seller will reasonably cooperate with each other
with respect to resolving any claim or Liability with respect to which one
Party is obligated to indemnify the other Party under this Agreement. Nothing
in this Agreement in any way restricts or limits the general obligation under
applicable Law of an indemnified party to use reasonable efforts to mitigate
any loss it may suffer or incur.

Section 10.05. Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) The amount of any and all Covered Losses under this Article 10 will be
determined net of any amounts actually recovered by any Purchaser Indemnified
Party (after netting any out of pocket costs or expenses incurred in obtaining
such recovery and the amount of any retrospective or other current increase in
insurance premiums to the extent attributable to the payment of such cash
recovery or the existence of such Covered Losses) under or pursuant to any
insurance policy (including the RandW Insurance Policy) under which or pursuant
to which such Purchaser Indemnified Party is a party or has rights
(collectively, "Alternative Arrangements"). Purchaser will use (and will cause
its Affiliates to use) reasonable efforts to collect the proceeds of any
available Alternative Arrangements; provided that this requirement shall not
apply to any insurance policies for pollution legal Liability purchased in
connection with or following the completion of the Transactions; and provided,
further, that the pursuit of any such recovery shall not be a condition or
prerequisite to the making of a claim for indemnification hereunder or a
prerequisite to the receipt of indemnification under this Article 10\.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
indemnified party will be entitled to recover from an indemnifying party more
than once in respect of the same Covered Losses.

Section 10.06. Exclusive Remedy. This Article 10 and any RandW Insurance Policy
obtained by Purchaser shall be the exclusive remedy of the Parties following

the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the Parties
contained in this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except
for (i) disputes under Section 1.05(b) or Section 6.03, which disputes will be
resolved in accordance with the dispute mechanisms set forth therein, (ii)
claims for specific performance and other injunctive relief in accordance with
Section 11.07, (iii) claims of fraud, and (iv) obligations under Article 6. In
furtherance of the foregoing, and except as specifically set forth in this
Agreement, each indemnified party hereby waives and releases, from and after
the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action it may have against any indemnifying party
(including such indemnifying party's Affiliates) with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether arising under or
based upon any Law (including any claim Purchaser may otherwise have against
Seller arising under any Environmental Law). Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge and agree
that from and after the Closing, except in the case of fraud, Seller shall not
have any direct or indirect Liability with respect to any breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement. In furtherance of
the foregoing, the Parties each acknowledge that, except in the case of fraud,





-63-

(y) the sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any breach by Seller of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be satisfied
solely from any RandW Insurance Policy obtained by Purchaser, and (z) Seller
shall not have any direct or indirect Liability with respect to such RandW
Insurance Policy (including by way of subrogation).

AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET
FORTH IN THIS SECTION 11.08.

Section 11.09. Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which will be
an original, with the same effect as if the signatures were upon the same
instrument. The electronic facsimile transmission of any signed original
counterpart of this Agreement will be deemed to be the delivery of an original
counterpart of this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein,
no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits,
remedies or Liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.

Section 11.10. Definitional and Interpretative Provisions. The following
provisions will be applied wherever appropriate herein: (a) "herein,"
"hereby," "hereunder," "hereof" and other equivalent words shall refer to this
Agreement in its entirety and not solely to the particular portion of this
Agreement in which such word is used; (b) all definitions set forth in this
Agreement will be deemed applicable whether the words defined are used in the
singular or the plural; (c) wherever used, any pronoun or pronouns will be
deemed to include both the singular and plural and to cover all genders; (d)
all accounting terms not specifically defined will be construed in accordance
with GAAP; (e) this Agreement will be deemed to have been drafted by the
Parties and this Agreement will not be construed against any Party as the
principal draftsperson; (f) any references to a particular Section, Article or
Exhibit means a Section or Article of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless
another agreement is specified; (g) all references or citations in this
Agreement to statutes or regulations or statutory or regulatory provisions
will, when the context requires, be considered citations to such statutes,
regulations or provisions directly or indirectly superseding such statutes,
regulations or provisions; (h) the Exhibits and the Disclosure Schedule
attached to this Agreement are incorporated by reference and will be
considered part of this Agreement; (i) the headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of identification only and are not intended to describe,
interpret, define or limit the scope, extent or intent of this Agreement or
any provision; (j) unless otherwise expressly provided, wherever the consent
of any Person is required or permitted, such consent may be withheld in such
Person's sole and absolute discretion; (k) "including" means "including,
without limitation;" (l) the words "in the ordinary course of business" and
"in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice" shall be
construed to mean the ordinary course of business of the Company, consistent
in nature, scope and magnitude with past practices; (m) the phrase "made
available" shall be construed to mean uploaded to the Data Room at least one
Business Day prior to the Effective Date and that Purchaser and its
representatives have had continuous access to such materials; and (n) the word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase does not mean simply "if." The disclosure
of any matter or item in the Disclosure Schedule will not be deemed to
constitute an acknowledgement that any such matter is required to be disclosed
or is otherwise material. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or in the
Disclosure Schedule but not otherwise defined therein, will have the meaning
as defined in this Agreement. The Parties have participated jointly in the
negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, the entirety of this Agreement will be
construed as if

drafted jointly by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will
arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

Section 11.11. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the other
Transaction Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the
entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter of the
Transaction Agreements and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both oral and written, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter
of the Transaction Agreements.

Section 11.12. Disclosure Schedule. There may be included in the Disclosure
Schedule and elsewhere in this Agreement items and information that are not
"material," and such inclusion will not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or
agreement that any such item or information (or any non-disclosed item or
information of comparable or greater significance) is "material," or to affect
the interpretation of such term for purposes of this Agreement. Disclosures
included in any Section of the Disclosure Schedule will be considered to be
made for purposes of all other Sections of the Disclosure Schedule to the
extent that the relevance of any such disclosure to any other Section of the
Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent on its face; provided that no
matter shall be deemed disclosed in respect of clause (ii) of Section 3.06(b)
of the Disclosure Schedule unless actually set forth on such Section of the
Disclosure Schedule. Matters reflected in the Disclosure Schedule are not
necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be disclosed in
the Disclosure Schedule.

Section 11.13. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted so as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable
Law, then such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect the
validity, legality or enforceability of any other provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement, and this Agreement will be re-formed, construed
and enforced in such manner as will effect as nearly as lawfully possible the
purposes and intent of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or
portion of any provision of this Agreement.

Section 11.14. Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver.

(a) It is acknowledged by the Parties that Seller and its Affiliates have
retained Jones Day to act as its counsel in connection with the Transactions
and that Jones Day has not acted as counsel for any other Person in connection
with the Transactions. Purchaser hereby agrees that, in the event that a
dispute arises between Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and Seller or any of
its Affiliates in respect of the Transactions, any Transaction Agreement or
the negotiation thereof, Jones Day may represent Seller or any such Affiliate
in such dispute even though the interests of Seller or such Affiliate may be
directly adverse to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates and even though Jones
Day may have represented the Company in a matter substantially related to such
dispute, and Purchaser hereby waives, on behalf of themselves and each of its
Affiliates, any conflict of interest in connection with such representation by
Jones Day. Purchaser further agrees that, as to all communications, whether
written or electronic, among Jones Day and Seller and its Affiliates, and all
files attorney notes, drafts or other

* * *





documents that relate in any way to the Transactions and that predate the
Closing, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence,
and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to Seller (or its
Affiliates, as appropriate) and will be controlled by Seller (or its
Affiliates, as appropriate) and, subject to the following sentence, will not
pass to or be claimed by Purchaser or the Business following the Closing.
Purchaser will take, and to cause its respective Affiliates to take, all steps
reasonably necessary to implement the intent of this Section 11.14(a).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between the
Purchaser or the Company, on the one hand, and any third party that is not
Seller or an Affiliate of Seller, on the other hand, after the Closing,
Purchaser and/or the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications by Jones Day to such third
party; provided, however, that Purchaser and/or the Company may not waive such
privilege without the prior written consent of Seller.

(b) The Parties understand that nothing in this Agreement, including the
foregoing provision regarding the ownership and assertion of privilege, will
be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable attorney-client privilege. The
Parties further understand that the Parties have each undertaken reasonable
best efforts to prevent the disclosure of confidential or attorney-client
privileged information. Notwithstanding those efforts, the Parties further
understand that the consummation of the Transactions may result in the
inadvertent disclosure of information that may be confidential or subject to a
claim of privilege. The Parties further understand that any disclosure of
information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege will
not prejudice or otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege. The
Parties will use reasonable best efforts to return promptly any inadvertently
disclosed information to the appropriate Party upon becoming aware of its
existence.
