 (b) The aggregate amount owed in respect of the Indebtedness, including principal, interest, early retirement or prepayment fees and penalties of any kind that will be due and payable by the Company or its Subsidiaries, under the Term Loan Agreement, the Revolving Loan Agreement and/or the Company Airplane Debt, as applicable, to each Creditor executing a Payoff Letter (the " _Repayment Indebtedness_ ") as reflected in the Payoff Letters shall be paid by Buyer (on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries) on the Closing Date to such Creditor by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by such Creditor and in the amount specified in each Payoff Letter or otherwise established with such Creditor. Buyer, Seller and the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at Sellers cost and expense, to obtain either at or immediately after the Closing Date the release of any personal guaranties made by Seller or any Affiliate thereof in respect of the Repayment Indebtedness and the release of any related Lien on the assets of Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. 

   

 Section 2.5 Payment. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Seller shall designate not later than three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing an amount equal to (i) the Purchase Price, plus (ii) the Estimated Working Capital calculated pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_, plus (iii) the Estimated Capex Adjustment Amount calculated pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_, minus (iv) the aggregate amount of the Repayment Indebtedness, minus (v) the Escrow Amount, minus (vi) the Purchase Price Deposit (such aggregate amount, the " _Closing Date Payment Amount_ "). 

  

 Section 2.6 Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (a) On the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall enter into an escrow agreement with the Escrow Agent effective as of the Closing Date which shall be substantially in 

    ##### 

  

    

the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ (with such reasonable changes thereto
as shall be requested by the Escrow Agent) (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). On
the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver the Escrow Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") to be
designated and administered by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms
of the Escrow Agreement to partially secure the indemnification rights of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties as set forth in _ARTICLE 9_. The Escrow Amount
shall be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement. The Parties agree that the Escrow Agent shall manage and disburse
the contents of the Escrow Accounts in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. All costs, fees,
charges and expenses assessed by the Escrow Agent to maintain the Escrow
Accounts shall be borne one-half by Seller and one-half by Buyer. 

   

 (b) The Escrow Agreement shall require that, on December 15, 2012 (the " _Escrow Account Termination Date_ "), the Escrow Agent shall release, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Seller shall designate, such funds in an amount equal to the balance remaining in the Escrow Account, if any; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, on the Escrow Account Termination Date there remain claims for indemnification for which Buyer has provided notice to Seller pursuant to _ARTICLE 9_ that have not been (i) paid by the Escrow Agent, or (ii) resolved pursuant to (A) joint written instructions signed Buyer and Seller or (B) a final and binding judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, then the amount that the Escrow Agent would otherwise be obligated to release to Seller on the Escrow Account Termination Date shall be decreased by the aggregate amount of such outstanding claims and the aggregate amount of such outstanding claims shall be retained by the Escrow Agent and held pursuant to the Escrow Agreement until the resolution of the matters relating to such unresolved claims. Buyer and Seller shall treat and report any funds disbursed to Seller from the Escrow Account as additional Purchase Price; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent required by Section 483 or Section 1274 of the Code, a portion of any such funds shall be treated and reported as interest for Tax purposes. 

   

 Section 2.7 Estimates and Post-Closing Adjustment. 

  

 (a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth in reasonable detail Sellers good faith estimate and calculation of (i) the Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Working Capital_ "), and (ii) the Capex Adjustment Amount (the " _Estimated Capex Adjustment Amount_ "). The Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the Closing Date reflected on the Closing Statement shall be determined in accordance with GAAP on a basis consistent with the same accounting policies and procedures used to prepare the Financial Statements (except as otherwise set forth in the definition of "Working Capital"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the value of any Inventory of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be determined in accordance with the Working Capital Adjustment Concepts set forth on _Exhibit B_. The Capex Adjustment Amount reflected on the Closing Statement shall be calculated in accordance with the definition of "Capex Adjustment Amount." If the Closing Statement is delivered prior to the final determination of the amounts payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the 2011 Performance Based Plan, for purposes of the Closing Statement, the aggregate amount payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the 2011 Performance Based Plan for the full 2011 year shall be 

    ##### 

  

    

determined based on reasonable projected estimates made in good faith by
Seller and the Company in consultation with Buyer. 

    

 (i) " _Working Capital_ " means an amount (which may be positive or negative) equal to (1) the sum of the cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, investments, accounts receivable (net of allowances), inventory (including spare parts and warehouse inventory, but only to the extent such spare parts and warehouse inventory are not obsolete) and prepaid expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a combined basis, but, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any accounts or notes receivables from, and any prepaid expenses paid to, Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, _minus_ (2) the sum of the current liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a combined basis, including, without duplication, the aggregate amount payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the 2011 Performance Based Plan for the full 2011 year (prorated for the number of days elapsed in 2011 prior to and including the Closing Date), but, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include (x) any of the Repayment Indebtedness repaid at the Closing pursuant to  _Section 2.4_, or (y) any Liabilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) being released by Seller Parent and Seller at or prior to the Closing. 

   

 (ii) " _Capex Adjustment Amount_ " means an amount (which may be positive or negative) equal to (1) the amount of Authorized Capex, minus (2) the aggregate of the amounts set forth on the schedule of Capital Expenditures attached as _Exhibit C_ for the period commencing on November 1, 2011 and ending with the month in which the Closing occurs (prorated for the number of days elapsed in the case of the calendar month during which the Closing occurs). If the Closing is expected to occur after January 31, 2012, Seller shall deliver to Buyer, at least ten (10) Business Days prior to January 31, 2012, a supplement to _Exhibit C_ reflecting the Sellers reasonable, good-faith estimate of Capital Expenditures to be incurred in the ordinary course of business for February and March of 2012 (which estimate per month shall be no less than the Capital Expenditures contemplated by the projections provided by the Company to Buyer prior to the date hereof). Buyer shall be allowed to review such supplement and to the extent that Buyer has reasonable comments to such supplement, Seller and Buyer agree to work together in good faith to appropriately modify such supplement, which supplement as modified will be used for the purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, if the absolute value of the Capex Adjustment Amount calculated in accordance with the prior sentence would be less than $50,000, the Capex Adjustment Amount shall be zero. " _Authorized Capex_ " means Capital Expenditures made by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries during the period from November 1, 2011 through the Closing Date with respect to (1) to projects identified in the schedule of Capital Expenditures attached as _Exhibit C_ or (2) projects proposed by the Seller following the Signing Date that are approved by the Buyer in writing (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). 

  

 (b) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller the " _Post-Closing Statement_ " reflecting its calculation of (i) the Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the Closing Date and (ii) the Capex Adjustment 

    ##### 

  

    

Amount. The Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m. Central Time on the Closing Date
reflected on the Post-Closing Statement shall be determined in accordance
with GAAP on a basis consistent with the same accounting policies and
procedures used to prepare the Financial Statements (except as otherwise set
forth in the definition of Working Capital); _provided_ , _however_ , that
the value of any Inventory of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be
determined in accordance with the Working Capital Adjustment Concepts set
forth on _Exhibit B_. For avoidance of doubt, payments made by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall not be included in the Post-Closing
Statement. The Post-Closing Statement shall show the difference, if any,
between (i) the Estimated Working Capital and the Estimated Capex Adjustment
Amount on the Closing Statement and (ii) the Working Capital as of 11:59 p.m.
Central Time on the Closing Date and the Capex Adjustment Amount, as
calculated by Buyer in the Post-Closing Statement. 

   

 (c) Seller shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt to review the Post-Closing Statement, and during such time Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, provide Seller and its Representatives reasonable access to the books and records of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and Buyer shall cause the Company and its Representatives to provide reasonable assistance to Seller, in connection with Sellers review of the Post-Closing Statement. The Post-Closing Statement shall become final and binding on Seller and Buyer (in such instance, the " _Final Statement_ ") unless Seller gives written notice to Buyer of its disagreement with respect to any matter contained therein (" _Notice of Disagreement_ ") within thirty (30) days after the receipt thereof. Such Notice of Disagreement shall set forth with particularity an itemized list of the basis for any such objection(s). Buyer shall be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the Post-Closing Statement, except as so specifically objected to in such Notice of Disagreement with particularity. For a period of fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve in writing all of the differences with respect to each matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement, in which case any such resolution shall be final and binding on the Parties (in such instance, the " _Final Statement_ "). If, at the end of such fifteen (15) day period, Seller and Buyer have not resolved in writing all of the differences with respect to any such matter, then each unresolved matter (" _Disputed Matter_ "), along with the Closing Statement, Post-Closing Statement, the Notice of Disagreement, and any supporting documentation with respect to such documents, shall be submitted to and reviewed by PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if PricewaterhouseCoopers is unavailable or unwilling to serve, such other independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed to by the Parties (the " _Neutral Accountant_ "). Seller and Buyer shall deliver to such Neutral Accountant copies of schedules and documents which may be reasonably required by the Neutral Accountant to make its determination. The Neutral Accountant shall consider only the Disputed Matters and shall act promptly to resolve in writing all Disputed Matters, and its decisions with respect to the Disputed Matters shall be final and binding on each of Seller and Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such resolution of the Disputed Matters shall require payment of an amount greater than the highest amount or less than the lowest amount provided in writing for such resolution by either Seller or Buyer. The Neutral Accountant shall promptly notify Seller and Buyer of its resolution of the Disputed Matters and shall prepare a revised statement reflecting the resolution of all Disputed Matters promptly after such resolution (in such instance, the " _Final Statement_ ") and shall deliver it to Seller and Buyer. The fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant shall be paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Seller. Each Party will bear the costs of its own counsel, witnesses (if any) and employees. Once the Final Statement has been determined in accordance with the provisions of this 

    ##### 

  

    

 _Section 2.7(c)_, such calculation shall be final and binding for all
purposes of this Agreement. The Working Capital or Capex Adjustment Amount
set forth on any Final Statement as determined in accordance with this
_Section 2.7(c)_ is the " _Final Working Capital Amount_ " or the " _Final
Capex Adjustment Amount_ ", as applicable. 

   

 (d) Within ten (10) days after the Final Statement has been determined in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.7(c)_: 

    

 (i) In the event that the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is positive, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Seller shall have designated prior to the Closing an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount; and 

   

 (ii) In the event that the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is negative, Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as Buyer shall have designated prior to the Closing an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount. 

  

 Section 2.8 Income Tax Treatment of the Sale; Allocation of Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, under Section 1060 of the Code, the allocation of the Purchase Price must be reported to the IRS on Form 8594 for the tax period that includes the Closing Date. If Seller has provided Buyer with the certificate described in _Section 7.2(b)(xii)_ , Buyer shall not withhold any amount under Section 1445 of the Code from any payment of the Purchase Price due to Seller.

 Section 9.4 Limits on Indemnification. 

  

 (a) A Party against whom a claim for indemnification is sought by an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _ARTICLE 9_ (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall not be liable with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(i)_ (where Seller is the Indemnifying Party) or _Section 9.3(i)_ (where Buyer is the Indemnifying Party) to any Indemnified Party unless and until the aggregate amount of all claims against such Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 9.2(i)_ (where Seller is the Indemnifying Party) or _Section 9.3(i)_ (where Buyer is the Indemnifying Party) exceeds $5,250,000 (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "), as to which such Indemnifying Party shall thereafter be responsible for all such Losses relating to such claims from the first dollar, and not merely the amount in excess of the Indemnification Threshold. No Buyer Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnification for a Loss pursuant to _Section 9.2(i)_ if, with respect to any individual item of Loss or group of items of Loss arising out of the same or similar facts or circumstances, such items are less than $50,000 (the " _De Minimis Threshold_ "). 

   

 (b) The maximum aggregate amount recoverable from Seller pursuant to _Section 9.2(i)_ shall be $26,250,000 (the " _Cap Amount_ "). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding _Section 9.4(a)_ and _(b)_ hereof, none of the Indemnification Threshold, the Cap Amount and the De Minimis Threshold shall apply to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(i)_ with respect to any inaccuracy, misrepresentation or breach of (i) any Fundamental Representation or (ii) of any of the representations and warranties in  _Section 3.2(k)_ ( _Indebtedness_ ), or _Section 3.2(gg)_ ( _Gary-Williams Retail Solutions_ ). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) For the avoidance of doubt, none of the Indemnification Threshold, the Cap Amount or the De Minimis Threshold shall apply to claims for Indemnification pursuant to _Section 9.2(ii)_ through _(viii)_ or _Section 9.3(ii)_ through _(iv)_. 

   

 (e) No Party shall be liable for any Losses to the extent that (a) such Indemnified Party receives proceeds from insurance policies for such Losses in connection with the circumstances related to the claim giving rise to the Losses but less the amount of any increase in the premium for the insurance policy under which payment of insurance proceeds was made attributable solely to the payment of such Losses, or (b) the Indemnified Party recovers from a third-party an amount directly related to the claim giving rise to the Losses. 

   

 (f) An Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify an Indemnified Party or otherwise have Liability to an Indemnified Party under this Agreement for consequential damages, special damages, punitive damages, incidental damages, indirect damages, or similar items (and the Indemnified Party shall not recover for such amounts). 

   

 Section 9.5 Exclusive Buyer Remedy. After the Closing Date, except for claims of fraud or intentional misrepresentation and except as provided in _Section 11.1_, the indemnification provisions of  _ARTICLE 9_ and _ARTICLE 10_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, for all matters arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the contemplated transactions, including for any inaccuracy or breach of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants contained herein and preclude the assertion by any Indemnified Party of any other remedies which would otherwise have been available in common law or by statute. No Party shall have any right to setoff against any payments to be made by it pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise. 

  

 Section 9.6 No Waiver of Contractual Representations and Warranties. Seller agrees that Buyers rights to indemnification for the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement are part of the basis for the bargain contemplated by this Agreement and Buyers rights to indemnification shall not be affected or waived by virtue of (and Buyer shall be deemed to have relied upon the express representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of Buyer of any untruth of any such representation or warranty of Seller or the Company set forth in this Agreement, and regardless of whether such knowledge was obtained through Buyers own investigation or through disclosure by Seller or another Person, regardless of whether such knowledge was obtained before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.7 Direct Claims. If an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification for any claim other than a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, as promptly as is practicable, give written notice to the applicable Indemnifying Party. The failure to make timely delivery of such written notice by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability under this _ARTICLE 9_ with respect to such matter, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced by failure to give such notice. 

  

 Section 9.8 Third-Party Claims. The Indemnified Party shall give written notice to the Indemnifying Party within thirty (30) days after such Indemnified Party receives written 

   ##### 

  

    

notice of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or demand asserted by any
person who is not a Party (or a successor to a Party) to this Agreement (a "
_Third-Party Claim_ ") that is or may give rise to an indemnification claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the failure of the Indemnified Party to give
notice as provided in this _Section 9.8_ shall not relieve any Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this _ARTICLE 9_ , except to the extent that
such failure actually and materially prejudices the rights of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party may elect, within thirty (30) days
after receipt of notice of any such matter, to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend
any such claim if it refuses to acknowledge fully in writing its obligations
to indemnify the Indemnified Party for all Losses arising from such Third-
Party Claim pursuant to this  _ARTICLE 9_ or contests in writing, in whole or
in part, its indemnification obligations for such claim; provided, further,
that if the Indemnifying Party is Seller, Seller shall not have the right to
defend or compromise any such claim if (1) the claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, or allegation or
investigation, (2) the claim solely seeks an injunction or equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party, or (3) the claim is subject to the limitations
set forth in _Section 9.4_ and asserts an amount of Losses, which, when
taken together with all amounts paid to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
resolved indemnification claims that are subject to the limitations set forth
in _Section 9.4_ and the maximum aggregate amount of Losses in all other
unresolved indemnification claims that are subject to the limitation set
forth in _Section 9.4_, exceeds the Cap Amount. During such thirty (30) day
period, the Indemnified Party may (at the Indemnifying Partys expense) make
such filings, including motions for continuance (and answers if a motion for
continuance has not been granted), as may be necessary to preserve the
parties positions and rights with respect to such claims. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of and indemnification for any
such matter, then counsel for the Indemnifying Party, who shall in such case
conduct the defense of such claim, shall be approved by the Indemnified Party
(whose approval shall not unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed),
and the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at its own expense,
and may retain counsel of its choice at its own expense; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ, at the
Indemnifying Partys expense, one firm of counsel of its choice, and local
counsel in each applicable jurisdiction (if more than one jurisdiction is
involved), to represent the Indemnified Party if, in the Indemnified Partys
reasonable judgment, there exists a conflict of interest between
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, or if the Indemnifying
Party (i) elects not to or is not entitled to defend, compromise or settle a
Third-Party Claim, (ii) having timely elected to defend a Third-Party Claim,
fails adequately to prosecute or pursue such defense or (iii) a
defense exists for an Indemnified Party which is not available to the
Indemnifying Party, then in each case the Indemnified Party may defend such
Third-Party Claim on behalf of and for the account and risk of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such
litigation or proceeding, shall not, except with the prior written approval
of the Indemnified Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), consent to entry of any judgment or entry into any
settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release from all
liability with respect to such litigation or proceeding. The Indemnified
Party shall not settle or compromise any such claim without the prior written
approval of the Indemnifying Party, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party defends
the litigation, action, suit, demand or claim, the Indemnified Party shall
extend reasonable 

   ##### 

  

    

cooperation in connection with such defense, which shall be at Indemnifying
Partys sole expense. 

  

 Section 9.9 Adjustment. The Parties agree that to the greatest extent possible the payment of any indemnity hereunder (including payments made under _Section 10.11_) shall be treated for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, may object to or dispute the manner in which such Tax Return is prepared or the manner in which any Taxes relating thereto are determined or calculated by providing written notice of such objection or dispute to Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, within such twenty (20) Business Day review period and Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such objection or dispute. If, after ten (10) Business Days from the date on which written notice was provided, any dispute or objection raised therein remains unresolved, the unresolved dispute shall be submitted to the Neutral Accountant for resolution utilizing the same terms and procedures set forth in _Section 2.7(c)_for Disputed Matters (but only to the extent such procedures or terms are not inconsistent with the terms of this _Section 10.1_);  _provided_ , _however_ , that if the twenty (20) Business Day review period has not expired without written waiver by the reviewing Party, or the determination by the Neutral Accountant with respect to any disputed Tax issue is not made, prior to the due date (taking into account applicable extensions) for the filing of the Tax Return in question, the party responsible for preparing such return pursuant to this _Section 10.1(a)_ shall file such Tax Return and  _provided further_ , that upon the agreement of the Parties or the delivery of the determination by the Neutral Accountant to Buyer and Seller, if requested, such Tax Return shall be filed to reflect the agreement or determination (or, if such Tax Return has been required to be filed, such Tax Return shall be duly amended). The determination by the Neutral Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) Unless required by Law, or a determination of a Governmental Authority that is final and unappealable, Buyer shall not, and shall not allow the Company or its Subsidiaries, to file any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund for Taxes, in each case, if such Tax Return or claim for refund relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the prior written consent of Seller (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed or conditioned). 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Tax Return or amended Tax Return shall be filed (and no Tax election shall otherwise be made) which changes or otherwise modifies the U.S. federal income tax treatment of any member of the TGWC Tax Group as an S corporation within the meaning of Sections 1361 and 1362 of the Code or a QSub within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(3) of the Code (or the comparable state or local Tax law treatment of such entity), as the case may be, in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period. 

   

 Section 10.2 Tax Contests. Buyer and the Company shall have the exclusive authority to control any examination, investigation, audit, or other proceeding in respect of any Tax Return or Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries (a " _Tax Contest_ "), provided that (i) Seller shall have the right to participate fully in all aspects of the prosecution or defense of any Tax Contest to the extent it relates to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Pre-Closing Straddle Period and (ii) neither Buyer nor the Company shall settle or otherwise resolve any Tax Contest (or any issue raised in such Tax Contest) if such settlement or other resolution relates to Taxes for which Seller is liable under Law or this Agreement, without the written consent of Seller (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed or conditioned). 

  

 Section 10.3 Other Taxes. In the case of a Tax (other than any transactional Tax contemplated by  _Section 10.5_) of the Company or its Subsidiaries that is payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall be: 

  

 (a) in the case of a Tax that is (i) based on or measured by income, receipts or payroll or (ii) imposed in connection with any sale, removal, entry, or other transfer of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible), including any Tax described in clause (ii) that is designated as an excise tax, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the Straddle Period ended, and the books were closed, as of the close of business on the Closing Date (apportioning among the days in the Straddle Period on the basis of an equal amount per day any items available on an annual or periodic basis, such as amortization deductions, depreciation deductions, the effects of graduated rates, exemptions and exclusions); and 

   

 (b) in the case of any other Tax, deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period.

 Section 10.6 Notice. Buyer shall promptly notify Seller following receipt by Buyer of any written notice of a Tax Contest relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Pre-Closing Straddle Period which, if successful, could reasonably be anticipated to result in (i) a Tax liability of Seller or Seller Parent (whether under this Agreement or otherwise) or (ii) an indemnity payment to a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.11_, _provided_ that the failure to give prompt notice will not reduce Sellers indemnification obligations under _Section 10.11_, except to the extent that Seller Parent, Seller and their Affiliates are actually and materially prejudiced thereby. 

  

 Section 10.7 Cooperation. Buyer, the Company and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) (i) reasonably assist in the preparation and timely filing of any Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries; (ii) reasonably assist in any audit or other proceedings with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether or not a Tax Contest); (iii) make available any information, records, or other documents relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries reasonably requested by another Party; (iv) reasonably provide any information required to allow Buyer, the Company or Seller to comply with any information reporting or withholding requirements imposed under the Code or other applicable Laws; and (v) reasonably assist in providing or obtaining certificates or forms that are necessary or appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any transactional Tax contemplated by _Section 10.5_.

At Sellers request, Buyer or the Company (or its Affiliates) shall apply, at the sole cost and expense of Seller, for any Tax refund available for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period (as determined by applying the principles of _Section 10.3_), and any refund received shall be paid to Seller within ten (10) days of receipt, net of any out-of-pocket costs and Taxes incurred by Buyer or the Company (or its Affiliates) to the extent such refund is not reflected as an asset on the Financial Statements and not taken into account as an asset in determining the Working Capital as set forth in the Final Statement. 

  

 Section 10.9 Tax Sharing Agreements. Seller Parent shall cause any and all Tax sharing, indemnity, reimbursement or other similar agreements between (i) any member of the TGWC Tax Group (other than the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company), on the one hand, and (ii) the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, on the other hand, to be terminated on or before the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, no party shall have any rights or obligations under any such agreement. 

  

 Section 10.10 Income Tax Treatment of the Sale; Allocation of Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the purchase of the Company Shares contemplated by this Agreement will be treated as a sale of the assets of the Company (other than the shares of stock

of the Companys Subsidiaries) and of the Subsidiaries for U.S. federal income
tax purposes and for all income tax purposes in the jurisdictions in which
the Company is, and will be through the Closing Date, treated as a QSub
within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(3) of the Code or analogous state or
local provisions. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall complete a draft schedule (the " _Allocation Schedule_ ") allocating
the Purchase Price (and all assumed liabilities) among the assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries. Seller shall submit to Buyer written comments
(if any), within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Allocation Schedule,
to the extent Seller considers the Allocation Schedule to be inconsistent with
Section 1060 of the Code. Any disputes between Buyer and Seller shall be
resolved by the Neutral Accountant, the review by which shall be limited to
whether a disputed item is consistent with Section 1060 of the Code. Buyer
and Seller agree to file all Tax Returns, and agree not to take any position
in any Tax audit, litigation or otherwise, that is not, consistent with the
Allocation Schedule, unless, and then only to the extent, required by a
determination (as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or corresponding
provisions of state or local Law). 

   

 Section 10.11 Tax Indemnification. From and after the Closing, Seller Parent, Seller and their Affiliates shall be liable for, and shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties, the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company against, and hold them harmless from, (i) all Liability for Taxes owed by the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period (including Taxes incurred in connection with the sale of the Company Shares, the Pre-Closing Transactions and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement), as determined pursuant to Section 10.3, except (in each case) to the extent that such Liability is or has been taken into account as a liability in the Final Statement or is shown as a liability in the Financial Statements; (ii) all Liability for Taxes owed by any member of the TGWC Tax Group (other than the Company and any Subsidiary of the Company) for any taxable period (including Taxes incurred in connection with the sale of the Company Shares, the Pre-Closing Transactions and any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement); (iii) any Losses arising out of or relating to any breach of any representation or warranty contained in _Section 3.2(t)_; and (iv) Sellers Liability for any transactional Tax described in _Section 10.5_, and (v) all Liability for reasonable legal fees and expenses attributable to any item in the foregoing clauses. 

  

 Section 10.12 Tax Benefit. If Seller is required to make any indemnity payment due to Buyer under _Section 10.11_, and the events giving rise to the Losses at issue actually result in a U.S. federal income tax savings to Buyer, any member of the affiliated group including the Buyer, or the Company, in each case, for a tax period that includes or begins on or after the Closing Date (determined after first taking into account all other Tax benefits available to Buyer, any member of the affiliated group including the Buyer, or the Company, in each case, for such period), then any indemnity amount otherwise required to be paid under _Section 10.11_ with respect to such Losses shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that (x) such U.S. federal income tax savings actually realized exceeds (y) any U.S. federal income tax detriment to Buyer or the Company resulting from the receipt of such indemnity payment. 

  

 Section 10.13 Deductions. Buyer and Seller acknowledge that Seller Parent shall be entitled to claim a deduction for the aggregate amount actually paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the 2011 Performance Based Plan (regardless of when paid), to the extent permitted by applicable Laws; provided, however, that in the event that the Closing Date 

   ##### 

  

 

is prior to January 1, 2012, Seller shall only be entitled to claim a
deduction for an amount equal to the aggregate amount actually paid by
the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the 2011 Performance Based Plan
(regardless of when paid) prorated for the number of days elapsed in 2011
prior to and including the Closing Date. 

   

 Section 10.14 Miscellaneous. The covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this _ARTICLE 10_ shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect until sixty (60) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of limitation. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the limitations set forth in _ARTICLE 9_ of this Agreement shall apply with respect to indemnification for Taxes under this _ARTICLE 10_.

The failure in any one or more instances of a Party to insist upon performance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, to exercise any right or privilege in this Agreement conferred, or to waive any breach of any of the terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of any such terms, covenants, conditions, rights or privileges, but the same shall continue and remain in full force and effect as if no such forbearance or waiver had occurred. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving Party. 

  

 Section 12.17 Guaranty. 

  

 (a) Seller Parent fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Buyer the full, complete and timely compliance with and performance of all agreements, covenants and obligations of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) and, prior to the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries under this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents (the " _Seller Obligations_ ") (collectively, the " _Seller Parent Guaranty_ "). The Seller Obligations shall include Sellers obligation to satisfy all indemnification and other payment obligations of Seller arising in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, in each case, when and to the extent that, any of the same shall become due and payable or performance of or compliance with any of the same shall be required. The Seller Parent Guaranty constitutes an irrevocable and continuing guarantee of payment and performance and Seller Parent shall be liable for any breach of any of the Seller Obligations. The Seller Parent Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on Seller Parent and its successors and assigns until all of the Seller Obligations have been satisfied in full (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be deemed to have occurred until the date following the date on which all indemnification obligations of Seller under this Agreement expire). 

   

 (b) Buyer Parent fully, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Seller the full, complete and timely compliance with and performance of all agreements, covenants and obligations of Buyer and its Affiliates and, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries under this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents (the " _Buyer Obligations_ ") (collectively, the " _Buyer Parent Guaranty_ "). The Buyer Obligations shall include Buyers obligation to satisfy all indemnification and other payment obligations of Buyer arising in connection with this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, in each case, when and to the extent that, any of the same shall become due and payable or performance of or compliance with any of the same shall be required. The Buyer Parent Guaranty constitutes an irrevocable and continuing guarantee of payment and performance and Buyer Parent shall be liable for any breach of any of the Buyer Obligations. The Buyer Parent Guaranty shall remain in full force and effect and shall be binding on Buyer Parent and its successors and assigns until all Buyer Obligations have been satisfied in full (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be deemed to have occurred until
