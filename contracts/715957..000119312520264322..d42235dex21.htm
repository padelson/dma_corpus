asset sale, shall include a pro rata portion of any indebtedness that remains
with Seller or its Affiliates participating in such asset sale following such
asset sale), up to the remaining unpaid Purchase Price Repayment Amount.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, at any time following the earlier of
(i) a termination of this Agreement or (ii) July 1, 2021, but, in each case,
prior to December 15, 2021, Seller shall be entitled to pay the remaining
unpaid Purchase Price Repayment Amount in shares of DEI Common Stock (such
portion of the remaining unpaid Purchase Price Repayment Amount paid in shares
of DEI Common Stock, the " _Stock Portion_ ")

 



16

    

 by causing DEI to issue a number of shares of DEI Common Stock equal in
value to the Stock Portion (based on the DEI Common Stock Closing Price and
rounded to the nearest whole number of shares of DEI Common Stock) in
electronic book-entry form to Buyer. For the avoidance of doubt, the payment
of the Stock Portion in shares of DEI Common Stock shall reduce the amount of
the Purchase Price Repayment Amount payable in immediately available funds on
a dollar for dollar basis (based on the DEI Common Stock Closing Price). All
of the shares of DEI Common Stock to be issued and delivered by DEI or Seller
pursuant to this Agreement shall be (i) at the time of issuance,
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and
clear of any Liens, including those imposed by applicable securities laws and
any stock exchange on which the shares of DEI Common Stock are listed, (ii)
registered with the SEC for resale by Buyer within five (5) Business Days
following the applicable Issuance Date, and (iii) upon registration with the
SEC, listed on The New York Stock Exchange. With a view to making available to
Buyer the benefits of Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the SEC
that may at any time permit Buyer to sell these shares of DEI Common Stock to
the public without registration, DEI shall: (a) make and keep public
information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144;
(b) use reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC in a timely manner all
reports and other documents required of DEI under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act; and (c) furnish to Buyer, promptly upon request, a written
statement by DEI as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule
144 and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Upon registration of
shares of DEI Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement, the
Restrictive Legend will be removed on all of such shares of DEI Common Stock,
and, in each case, DEI shall issue a certificate representing such shares of
DEI Common Stock without such legend to Buyer or issue to Buyer by electronic
delivery at the applicable balance account at The Depository Trust Company.

(c) _Post-Closing Payment Amount_.

 

(i) As promptly as practical, but in no event later than thirty (30) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (at Buyers expense) prepare and deliver
to Seller a statement setting forth Buyers good faith calculation of the
Preliminary Post-Closing Payment Amount, and documentation sufficient to
confirm the accuracy of such calculation.

 

(ii) Following Sellers receipt of the Preliminary Post-Closing Payment
Amount, Seller and their agents, representatives and advisors shall be
permitted to review all books and records, working papers, financial records
and information of Buyer related to the Preliminary Post-Closing Payment
Amount and shall have such access to Buyers personnel as may be reasonably
necessary to permit Seller to review in detail the manner in which the
Preliminary Post-Closing Payment Amount was calculated and prepared. Within
thirty (30) days after Sellers receipt of the Preliminary Post-Closing
Payment Amount, Seller shall either:

 



17

    

(A) accept such Preliminary Post-Closing Payment Amount, in which case (1)
such Preliminary Post-Closing Payment Amount shall be deemed final and shall
be considered the " _Post-Closing Payment Amount_ " for purposes of this
Agreement and (2) (x) if the Post-Closing Payment Amount is positive, Buyer
shall pay to Seller, within five (5) days of confirmation of the Post-Closing
Payment Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by Seller, an amount equal to the Post-Closing Payment
Amount or (y) if the Post-Closing Payment Amount is negative (in which case,
the "Post-Closing Payment Amount" for purposes of this clause (y) shall be
deemed to be equal to the absolute value of such amount), Seller shall pay to
Buyer, within five (5) days of confirmation of the Post-Closing Payment
Amount, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to one or more
accounts designated by Buyer, an amount equal to the Post-Closing Payment
Amount; or

 

(B) dispute such Preliminary Post-Closing Payment Amount, in which case (1)
within ten (10) days of Sellers notice to Buyer of such dispute, such
dispute shall be referred to senior officers or other authorized
representatives of Seller and Buyer or their respective Affiliates, for
settlement of such dispute within thirty (30) days of referral, (2) the final
amount agreed to by such senior officers or other authorized representatives
shall be deemed final and shall be considered the " _Post-Closing Payment
Amount_ " for purposes of this Agreement and (3) (x) if the Post-Closing
Payment Amount is positive, Buyer shall pay to Seller, within five (5) days of
confirmation of the Post-Closing Payment Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by Seller, an
amount equal to the Post-Closing Payment Amount or (y) if the Post-Closing
Payment Amount is negative (in which case, the "Post-Closing Payment Amount"
for purposes of this clause (y) shall be deemed to be equal to the absolute
value of such amount), Seller shall pay to Buyer, within five (5) days of
confirmation of the Post-Closing Payment Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by Buyer, an
amount equal to the Post-Closing Payment Amount.

Section 2.2 Allocation.

 

(a) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller, using and
based upon the best information available to Buyer, an initial allocation
statement (the " _Initial Allocation Statement_ ") reflecting the allocation
of the Base Purchase Price among the Interests including, where applicable, a
further allocation of the Base Purchase Price to any interests in Indirect
Subsidiaries held by a Direct Subsidiary (the " _Initial Allocation_ "). As
soon as reasonably practicable, but no later than thirty (30) days following
the receipt of the Initial Allocation Statement, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a written report containing any changes that Seller proposes to be made
in such schedule (and specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail).

 



18

    

(b) Within thirty (30) days after the final determination of the Post-Closing
Payment Amount, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "
_Final Allocation Statement_ ") reflecting the allocation of the final
Purchase Price, as adjusted to reflect assumed liabilities and other amounts
deemed paid by Buyer for federal income Tax purposes, among the Interests (the
" _Final Allocation_ "). To the extent required by Section 338 or 1060, the
Final Allocation Statement shall include an allocation of that portion of the
adjusted Purchase Price allocated to a Direct Subsidiary among the separate
classes of assets of such entity (and a further allocation of the Purchase
Price attributable to an Indirect Subsidiary among the assets of
such subsidiary) in a manner that is consistent with the allocation
methodology provided by Section 338 or Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case may be. Within thirty
(30) days following the receipt by Seller of the Final Allocation Statement,
Seller shall review the Final Allocation and submit to Buyer in writing any
objections or proposed changes to the Final Allocation Statement (an "
_Objections Notice_ "). Unless Seller submits an Objections Notice on or
before the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Final Allocation
Statement prepared and delivered to Seller pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)_ shall be deemed agreed upon by the Parties and shall be deemed
conclusive for purposes of the Final Allocation.

 

(c) If Seller timely submits an Objections Notice in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.2(b)_, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith and use their
Reasonable Efforts to resolve such dispute. In the event the Parties are
unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Final Allocation Statement
within twenty (20) days after the delivery of the Objections Notice, neither
Buyer nor Seller will be bound by the Final Allocation Statement as prepared
by Buyer, and each Party may independently (and in its sole discretion) (i)
determine its own allocation of the Purchase Price between the ownership
interests of each Sale Entity and, with respect to that portion of the
adjusted Purchase Price to be allocated to each Sale Entity, among the
separate classes of assets of such Sale Entity, and (ii) file its Tax Returns
(and Tax Returns of its Affiliates) using alternative allocations of its
choosing.

(d) If the Parties ultimately agree on the Final Allocation Statement, (i)
such Final Allocation Statement shall be amended as, and to the extent, Buyer
and Seller agree to reflect any adjustment to the Purchase Price (as adjusted
to reflect assumed liabilities and other amounts deemed paid by Buyer for
federal income Tax purposes), (ii) except to the extent required to comply
with audit determinations of any Taxing Authority with jurisdiction over a
Party, Buyer and Seller shall report the Contemplated Transactions for all
required federal Income Tax and all other Tax purposes in a manner consistent
with the Final Allocation, and (iii) no Party shall take any position in any
Tax Return or Tax Proceeding that is inconsistent with the Final Allocation
without the consent of the other Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Party (or any of its Affiliates) shall be required to litigate before any
court or defend in any administrative proceeding (including any Tax audit or
examination) any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Taxing Authority
challenging such Final Allocation.

 



19

    

Section 2.3 Withholding. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and withhold any
amounts that are required to be deducted or withheld under any provision of
applicable Law, and any amount so deducted or withheld will be remitted by
Buyer to the applicable Taxing Authority, and shall be treated, for purposes
of this Agreement, as having been paid to the Person in respect of which the
deduction or withholding was made. Buyer shall use Reasonable Efforts to
notify the Seller before making any such deduction or withholding.

compliance with all applicable requirements of the applicable Laws have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

with respect to Company Employees or to which Seller or any ERISA Affiliate
contributes on behalf of Company Employees (hereafter " _Employee Plans_ ").

") or Section 430 of the Code is considered "at-risk", within the meaning of
Section 430(i)(4) of the Code, and to Sellers Knowledge, no condition exists
which would be expected to result in an Employee Plan becoming "at-risk" as

Seller is not responsible pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_, and if Seller

discretion and control over any and all Income Tax Returns required to be
filed by or in respect of a Sale Entity for a taxable period or portion
thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(ii) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
any Non-Income Tax Returns of the Sale Entities for Tax periods that begin

Straddle Period for Sellers review at least fifteen (15) days before the date
on which such Tax Return is required to be filed, or as soon as reasonably
possible if the Tax Return is required to be filed within ninety (90) days
following the Closing Date. Seller shall review such Tax Returns within ten
(10) days after the delivery of such Tax Returns. Seller will be deemed to
have approved such Tax Returns as prepared by Buyer if they fail to submit
comments within such ten (10) day

 review period. If Seller delivers comments to Buyer within such ten (10) day
review period, Buyer and Seller shall use good faith efforts to resolve any
dispute in connection with such comments. In the event Buyer and Seller are
unable to agree on any such revisions within ten (10) days after Seller
provides its comments, Buyer and Seller shall engage the Independent Auditor
to resolve the matter, and the Independent Auditors determination shall be
final and binding on the Parties. The Independent Auditor shall resolve the
dispute within twenty (20) days after the item has been referred to it.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _
5.3(b)(ii)_, Buyer shall be entitled to file on behalf of the Sale Entities,
or cause to be filed, the applicable Tax Return without having incorporated
Sellers proposed changes if necessary to avoid a late filing of such Tax
Return. If the Independent Auditors resolution of the dispute necessitates
the amendment of a Tax Return filed in accordance with the previous sentence,
then Buyer shall cause an amended Tax Return to be filed that reflects such
resolution. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor shall be borne by
each Party in the percentage inversely proportionate to the percentage of the
total items submitted for dispute that are resolved in such Partys favor.

 

(iii) Seller shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Buyer within fifteen (15) days
after the date on which Taxes are paid with respect to a Straddle Period an
amount equal to the portion of such Taxes, if any, which relates to the
portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date, after taking into
account any prepayments or deposits made by or on behalf of a Sale Entity on
or before the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have
no liability or obligation to pay any Taxes becoming due as a result of any
breach of any covenant, representation, warranty, undertaking or other
obligation imposed on Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement
(including, for this purpose, any of the Sale Entities) on or after the
Closing Date. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iii)_, in the case
of any Taxes that are imposed and are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending as
of the Closing Date shall, in the case of any Taxes imposed on a periodic
basis (such as real property Taxes), be deemed to be the amount of such Tax
for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the Tax period ending on and including the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period.
In the case of non-periodic Taxes (i.e., such as Taxes that are (w) based upon
or related to income or receipts, (x) imposed in connection with any capital
or debt restructuring, (y) imposed in connection with any sale, distribution,
or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible), or (z) payroll, withholding, excise and similar Taxes), the
portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of such Tax period ending on
the Closing Date shall be determined based on a closing of the books of the
Sale Entities at the end of the Closing.

 



38

    

(iv) Seller and Buyer agree that, except with respect to Tax incurred
by Seller upon the sale of the Interests to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement,
Buyer shall be responsible for all Taxes incurred by or with respect to the
Sale Entities, whether resulting from the assets or operations of the Sale
Entities or otherwise, for all Tax periods beginning after the Closing Date
(including the portion of any Straddle Period beginning immediately after the
Closing Date) to the extent attributable to the direct or indirect interest
acquired by Buyer. In the event Taxes for which Buyer is responsible under
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iv)_ are reduced because of Tax payments made by
Seller or a Sale Entity on or before the Closing Date (whether through
deposits, prepayments, credits, or otherwise), Buyer shall reimburse Seller
therefor within five (5) days after the date on which Buyer realizes the
benefit of the reduction.

 

(c) Each Party shall provide the other Parties with such assistance as may
reasonably be requested by the other Parties in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any
Governmental Authority, or any judicial or administrative proceedings relating
to liability for Taxes, and each will retain and provide the requesting
Party with any records or information which may be relevant to such return,
audit or examination, proceedings or determination. Any information obtained
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ or pursuant to any other Sections
hereof providing for the sharing of information relating to or review of any
Tax Return or other schedule relating to Taxes shall be subject to the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(d) Except as otherwise provide herein, in the case of any audit, examination,
or other proceeding (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") with respect to (i) any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date and (ii) with respect to any other
Tax period ending after the Closing Date for which Seller is or may be liable
for any Taxes pursuant to this Agreement, Buyer shall inform Seller in
writing of such Tax Proceeding within ten (10) days after the receipt by Buyer
of written notice thereof. In the event Buyer fails to timely provide Seller
with written notice of such Tax Proceeding, Sellers obligation to indemnify
Buyer or its Affiliates hereunder shall be reduced to the extent of any
Adverse Consequences arising as a result of such failure to notify. Buyer
shall afford Seller, at Sellers expense, the opportunity to control the
conduct of such Tax Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall have
the right, at Buyers expense, to attend and participate in such Tax
Proceeding, but only to the extent such Tax Proceeding pertains to a
Sale Entity and does not involve Seller or any of its Affiliates. If Seller
elects not to control the conduct of any such Tax Proceeding, Buyer shall
control the conduct of such Tax Proceeding at Buyers expense, and Seller
shall have the right (at Sellers expense) to attend and participate in such
Tax Proceeding. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall settle or compromise such Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Notwithstanding any other
provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall have the sole right
to control, settle, and compromise all Tax Proceedings related to Income Taxes
of a Sale Entity for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and Buyer shall have no right
to participate to attend or participate in any such Tax Proceeding, or to
receive copies of any correspondence or other information related to any Tax
Proceeding to the extent such Tax Proceeding, correspondence, or other
information includes or pertains to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 



39

    

(e) To the extent that a Sale Entitys liability for Taxes for a taxable year
or portion ending on or before the Closing Date (as computed in a manner
consistent with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iii)_, and after giving effect to any
Tax credits or Tax abatements) is less than the amount of estimated Taxes
paid by or on behalf of such Sale Entity with respect to all or a portion of
such taxable year or period, Buyer shall pay Seller the difference within two
(2) days of filing the relevant Tax Return that reflects such Tax.

 

(f) Without duplication of amounts payable to Seller pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_, any refund of Taxes paid or payable by or with respect
to the Sale Entities, shall be paid within two (2) Business Days of receipt as
follows, or to the extent payable but not paid due to offset against other
Taxes shall be paid by the Party receiving the benefit of the offset within
two (2) Business Days of such offset as follows: (i) to Seller if attributable
to any Tax period or portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date, or
for any Straddle Period to the extent allocable, determined in a manner
consistent with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iii)_, to the portion of such Tax
period beginning before and ending on the Closing Date; and (ii) to Buyer if
attributable to any Tax period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing
Date or for any Straddle Period to the extent allocable, determined in a
manner consistent with _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)(iii)_, to the portion of such
Tax period beginning after the Closing Date. Buyer shall cooperate, and shall
cause each of its Affiliates and the Sale Entities to cooperate, in obtaining
any Tax refund that Seller reasonably believes should be available, including
through filing appropriate forms with the applicable Taxing Authority.

(g) Except as provided otherwise herein, none of the Sale Entities shall take,
and none of Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall permit or otherwise allow
any of the Sale Entities to take, any action on the Closing Date that is not
in the ordinary course of the Sale Entities businesses, including, but not
limited to, the merger or liquidation of any of the Sale Entities or the
distribution of any property in respect of any of the Sale Entities stock,
partnership interests or membership interests, without the prior written
consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld in Sellers sole discretion.
For this purpose, an action taken effective as of the Closing Date shall be
treated as having been taken on the Closing Date.

 

(h) Except as required by Law, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall
(or shall cause or permit any of the Sale Entities to) take any action which
could (A) increase Sellers (or any of its Affiliates) liability for Taxes
(including any liability of Seller to indemnify Buyer for Taxes pursuant to
this Agreement) or (B) result in, or change the character of, any income or
gain that Seller (or any of its Affiliates) must report on any Income Tax
Return.

(i) All Tax sharing agreements or arrangements that provide for the
allocation, apportionment, sharing, or assignment of Tax liability between any
of the Sale Entities and Seller or Sellers Affiliates shall be terminated as
of the Closing Date.

 

(j) _Election Under Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10)_.

 

(i) Seller and Buyer shall make, or cause to be made, a timely and effective
joint election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and under any applicable
similar provisions of state or local law with respect to the purchase of the
interests in each Sale Entity specified by Buyer (all such elections being
referred to collectively as the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election_").

 



40

    

(ii) Buyer shall prepare Internal Revenue Service Form 8023,
required schedules thereto and any similar forms necessary to effectuate the
Section 338(h)(10) Election under applicable state and local laws
(collectively, the " _Section_ __ _ 338(h)(10) Election Forms_"). Seller
shall cooperate with Buyer in the preparation of the Section 338(h)(10)
Election Forms and shall deliver duly completed, executed copies thereof on
the Closing Date. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other and take
all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such additional forms,
Tax Returns, elections, schedules, and other documents as may be required) to
effect and preserve the Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance
with Section 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder and
comparable provisions of applicable state and local Tax laws and shall take no
action inconsistent therewith except to the extent required pursuant to
a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code or any similar
provision of any state, foreign or local law.

Section 5.5 Notice of Changes. From the Effective Date until the Closing,
each Party shall promptly advise the other Party in writing with respect to
any fact, event or circumstance that arises after the Effective Date of which
such Party obtains knowledge and which, if existing or occurring at
the Effective Date and not set forth in this Agreement or any of the
Schedules, would have constituted a breach of a representation or warranty of
such Party contained in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ , as the case may be,
such that the closing condition in _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or _Section_ __ _
7.2_, as the case may be, cannot be satisfied. Any actions of the Sale
Entities or the JV Company occurring following the Effective Date which are
required or permitted by this Agreement, including Actions permitted or
consented to by Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(a)_ shall automatically
be deemed to amend and update any appropriate Schedule solely with respect to

that such action does not result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.6 Employee Matters.

 

(a) Buyer shall cause all Company Employees (other than Sale Entity Employees)

(d) DEI shall cause any long-term incentive award granted to a
Company Employee under a DEI long-term incentive plan (a " _DEI LTI Award_ ")
to vest on a pro-rata basis on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms

performance period applicable to such award through the applicable Closing
Date. With respect to each DEI LTI Award of a Transferred Employee that is
pro-rated in accordance with the preceding sentence, Buyer shall cause the
applicable Post-Closing Employer to grant to each such Transferred Employee a
long-term incentive award under the Post-Closing Employers long-term

Post-Closing Employer to continue to grant annual awards under its long-term
incentive plan for eligible non-officer Transferred Employees on terms that
are comparable to DEIs Leadership Incentive Program as in effect as of the

Buyer) of long-term incentive awards under the Post-Closing Employers long-
term incentive plan on terms that are comparable to the terms of DEIs long-
term incentive program for officers as of the date hereof (the " _DEI LTI
Program_ ") and with target grant-date values of awards for each such
eligible Transferred Employee that are no less than the target grant-date

45

    

(g) As of the Closing Date, all Transferred Employees shall, if
applicable, be eligible to participate in and, if elected, shall commence
participation in the employee benefit plans (within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA), programs, policies, contracts, fringe benefits, or
arrangements (whether written or unwritten), including, but not limited to,
the tax-qualified defined benefit plan (" _Post-Closing Salaried Pension Plan_
"), defined contribution plan, retiree medical plan and retiree life plan, of

Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing Employer to use Reasonable Efforts to
remove any restrictions including restrictions in any insurance policy), to
waive all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to Transferred Employees and their spouses and
dependents, if applicable, under the Post-Closing Employee Plans. Buyer shall
cause each Post-Closing Employer, to the extent permissible under any Post-
Closing Employee Plan (provided that Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing
Employer to use its Reasonable Efforts to remove any restrictions under any
Post-Closing Employee Plan or related insurance policy), to provide each
Transferred Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid

Employer to provide a Post-Closing Salaried Pension Plan that provides a level
of pension benefits that is not lower than such level of pension benefits for
the Transferred Employees as of the Closing Date using the applicable pension
benefit formula provided in the Dominion Energy Pension Plan. Each Transferred
Employees benefit under the applicable Post-Closing Salaried Pension Plan
shall be at least equal to (A) minus (B), where: (A) equals the total accrued
pension benefit for such Transferred Employee under the Post-Closing Salaried
Pension Plan, calculated as of such Transferred Employees retirement or
termination date from the Post-Closing Employer and its Affiliates, taking
into account service credit and compensation earned from the Post-Closing
Employer, DEI or an ERISA Affiliate through the Closing Date, plus service
credit and compensation earned under the Post-Closing Salaried Pension
Plan from the Closing Date until such Transferred Employees retirement or
termination date; and (B) equals the accrued normal retirement benefit of such
Transferred Employee under the Dominion Energy Pension Plan as of the Closing
Date. DEI will provide all necessary earnings history and information
required to calculate the benefit under Part A and B of the formula as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Closing Date.

 

(i) During the Continuation Period, Buyer shall cause the Post-Closing
Employer to provide a level of retiree medical and life insurance benefits to
each Transferred Employee hired by Buyer and its Affiliates before October 1,
2015 not lower than the level of retiree medical and life insurance benefits
available to each such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing.

 



46

    

(j) Effective as of the Closing Date, each Sale Entity shall cease to be
a participating employer in all Employee Plans sponsored by DEI or any ERISA
Affiliate. All Company Employees shall cease to be active participants in all
Employee Plans sponsored by DEI or any ERISA Affiliate and shall cease to
accrue additional benefits under such plans for any periods from and after
the Closing Date.

(k) Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing Employer to accept or cause to be
accepted transfers from DEIs or any ERISA Affiliates flexible spending
account plan of each Transferred Employees account balances as of the Closing

Closing Employee Plan. On and after the Closing Date, Transferred Employees
shall have no further claim for reimbursement under flexible spending account
plans sponsored by DEI or any ERISA Affiliate and all claims must
be submitted under the applicable Post-Closing Employee Plan, including
expenses incurred prior to the Closing Date.

(l) Buyer shall cause to be provided to each Transferred Employee credit for
prior service with DEI or any ERISA Affiliate for all purposes (including
vesting, eligibility, benefit accrual or level of benefits) in all Post-
Closing Employee Plans, including fringe benefit plans, vacation and sick
leave policies, severance plans or policies, retiree medical plans and
retirement plans maintained or provided by the applicable Post-Closing
Employer or its Affiliates in which such Transferred Employees are eligible
to participate after the Closing Date.

(m) Buyer shall cause each Post-Closing Employer to provide each Transferred
Employee credit for all of the Transferred Employees earned but unused
vacation and sick leave and other time-off as of the Closing Date as
determined under time-off policies maintained by DEI or its Affiliate, as
applicable.

(n) To the extent allowable by law, Buyer shall take any and all necessary
action to cause the trustee of a defined contribution plan of Buyer or one of
its Affiliates, if requested to do so by a Transferred Employee, to accept a
direct "rollover" of all or a portion of such employees distribution from a
defined contribution plan maintained by DEI or any ERISA Affiliate (excluding
securities, but including plan loans) if such Transferred Employee elects such
direct rollover within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date.

(o) As of the Closing, DEI or each ERISA Affiliate shall take all
necessary action to cause the defined contribution plans maintained by DEI or
such ERISA Affiliate to fully vest the Company Employees in their account
balances under such defined contribution plans.

 

(p) With respect to each Company Employee (including any beneficiary or the
dependent thereof), DEI or each ERISA Affiliate shall retain all liabilities
and obligations arising under any medical, dental, vision, life insurance or
accident insurance benefit plans sponsored by DEI or such ERISA Affiliate to
the extent that such liability or obligation relates to claims incurred
(whether or not reported or paid) prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.6(p)_, a claim shall be deemed to be incurred (i) with
respect to medical, dental and vision benefits, on the date that the medical,
dental or vision services giving rise to such claim are performed, (ii) with
respect to life insurance, on the date that the death occurs, and (iii) with

(q) With respect to each Company Employee who is not actively at work and who
is, as of the Closing Date, receiving any form of pay/wage continuation
(including, but not limited to, short-term sickness, disability, military
leave or vacation pay), DEI or each ERISA Affiliate shall be responsible for
any such payments due prior to the Closing Date and Buyer or the applicable
Post-Closing Employer shall be responsible for any payments due on or after
the Closing Date, except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.6(r)_ with respect
to workers compensation benefits.

(r) DEI and its Affiliates shall be responsible for all workers compensation
liabilities and obligations for Company Employees or other former employees
of the Sale Entities to the extent such liabilities and obligations relate to
events which occurred prior to the Closing. Buyer shall assume all workers
compensation liabilities and obligations for Company Employees or other
former employees of the Sale Entities to the extent such liabilities and
obligations relate to events which occur on or after the Closing.

 

(s) Effective as of the Closing Date, DEI or each ERISA Affiliate shall be

or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within thirty (30)

for penalties, fines and assessments, must be made by delivery by the Party
to be indemnified (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") to the Party responsible for
the indemnification obligation (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") of written
notice containing details reasonably sufficient to disclose to the
Indemnifying Party the nature and scope of the claim including an estimate of
the amount of claimed Adverse Consequences and copies of all relevant
pleadings, documents and information within ten (10) Business Days after the
Indemnified Partys knowledge of such claim. Any failure in the delivery of
such notice shall not affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Party, except
to the extent that the rights and remedies of the Indemnifying Party are
adversely affected or prejudiced as a result of the failure to give, or delay
in giving, such notice. In the event that any Action is brought against an
Indemnified Party for which the Indemnifying Party may be required to
indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, the Action shall be defended by
the Indemnifying Party and such defense shall include all appeals or reviews.
The Indemnifying Party shall not make any settlement of any claims without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, _provided_ , _however_ , that
such consent shall not be required if (i) the settlement does not involve any
finding or admission of any violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing
by the Indemnified Party, (ii) the sole relief is monetary damages, which the
Indemnifying Party shall pay or cause to be paid concurrently with the
effectiveness of such settlement, (iii) the settlement involves a full
release of the claim and (iv) the settlement does not encumber any of the
assets of any Indemnified Party or impose any restriction or condition that
would apply to or materially adversely affect any Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party withholds its consent unreasonably, the Indemnified Party
shall be obligated for any future expenses and excess settlement amounts. The
Indemnified Party shall fully cooperate at its expense in connection with the
defense of any such claims including, without limitation, reasonable access
to the Indemnified Partys records and personnel relating to such claim, and
will have the right to participate in the defense of any claim by counsel of
its own choosing and at its own expense. 

Section 10.3 Survival. The representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of six (6)

shall survive the Closing until the sixtieth (60th) day after expiration of
the statute of limitations period applicable thereto, and (ii) the Fundamental
Representations (other than _Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_, which shall survive for a
period of two (2) years after the Closing Date) shall survive the Closing for
a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date. The covenants and
agreements of the Parties to be performed or complied with prior to the
Closing shall survive the Closing for a period of ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date and those covenants and agreements of the Parties that by their

a period of thirty (30) days after their expiration in accordance with their
terms. No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability for any claim for
indemnification made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1(a)_ or _10.1(b)_ by an
Indemnified Party hereunder unless the Indemnified Party notifies such
Indemnifying Party of such claim in writing, setting forth in reasonable
detail the nature of the claim on or before the expiration of the time periods
provided in the first sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_; _provided_
that if no notice of a claim for indemnification made pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 10.1(a)_ or _10.1(b)_ has been made within the time periods set forth above
in this  _Section_ __ _ 10.3_, then such claim for indemnification shall be
waived.

Section 10.4 Exclusivity. Following the Closing, except for actual fraud or
willful misconduct, the rights and remedies of Seller and the Seller
Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties, on the other hand, for damages under this _Article X_ are, solely as
between Seller and the Seller Indemnified Parties on the one hand, and Buyer
and the Buyer Indemnified Parties on the other hand, exclusive and in lieu of
any and all other rights and remedies for damages which Seller and the Seller
Indemnified Parties on the one hand, and Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties on the other hand, may have under this Agreement or under applicable
Laws with respect to the Contemplated Transactions, including any breach of
this Agreement, warranty, tortious conduct or otherwise, and whether at

Action to enforce this _Article X_.

 

Section 10.5 Limitation of Claims; Mitigation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein:

(a) Except with respect to claims for breaches of  _Section_ __ _ 3.9_ (Tax
Matters) (each, a " _Tax Representation_ ") and the Retained Liabilities, the

amount equal to the Base Purchase Price (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that with respect to indemnification obligations of Seller under
_Section_ __ _ 10.1(a)(i)_ (other than with regard to any breaches of any
of Sellers Fundamental Representations or a Tax Representation) the Cap
shall be an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the Base Purchase Price.

 

(b) In no event shall Seller have any liability to Buyer in respect of any
indemnification obligations under  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(a)(i)_ or _Section_
__ _ 10.1(a)(ii)_ unless and until such liabilities exceed, in the aggregate,
$75,000,000.00 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), and then only to the extent
such liabilities are in excess of the Basket Amount, subject to the Cap;
_provided_ , that the Basket Amount limitation shall not apply to breaches of
any of Sellers Fundamental Representation (other than with respect to 
_Section_ __ _ 3.2(d)_) or any Tax Representation.

(c) No representation or warranty made in _Article III_ shall be deemed to be
breached and no claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.1(a)(i)_ may be made unless the Adverse Consequences resulting from or
arising out of any individual circumstance or occurrence that results in
Adverse Consequences actually incurred or paid by a Buyer Indemnified Party
exceed $5,000,000.00 (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ "), and if such Adverse
Consequences exceed the Per Claim Threshold, the full amount thereof (after
taking into account the limitations set forth in this _Article X_ ) shall be
taken into account in determining whether, and the extent to which, the Basket
Amount has been met and, if the Basket Amount has been met, shall be subject
to indemnification under this Article except to the extent limited by this
_Section_ __ _ 10.5_; _provided_ , that the Per Claim Threshold limitation
shall not apply to breaches of any of Sellers Fundamental Representations or
any Tax Representation.

 



60

    

(d) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to any indemnity payment
for breaches of representations and warranties by the Indemnifying Party to
the extent the Indemnified Party had knowledge of any event, action or
circumstance giving rise to such breach prior to the Closing.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, (i) Seller shall not be liable
for any Adverse Consequences actually incurred or paid by a Buyer Indemnified
Party to the extent that such Adverse Consequences arose from (A) a change in
accounting or Law, policy or practice made after the Closing Date or (B) any
Law not in force on the Closing Date, and (ii) no Party shall be responsible
for Adverse Consequences with respect to any claim which is contingent unless
and until such contingent claim becomes an actual liability of the Indemnified
Party and is due and payable, so long as such claim was timely submitted
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.3_.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, no Party shall be liable
under this _Article X_ for an amount (i) to the extent, if any, that any
Adverse Consequences giving rise to such amount results from a failure on the
part of any Indemnified Party to exercise good faith in not jeopardizing or
prejudicing the interests of the Indemnifying Party or otherwise arises out of
any action taken or omitted to be taken by an Indemnified Party or (ii) unless
and until all rights and remedies of an Indemnified Party under any other
obligation of indemnification in its favor shall have first been exhausted,
including using Reasonable Efforts to (A) secure payment from insurance
policies that provide coverage with respect to such Adverse Consequences,
and (B) secure reimbursement, indemnity or other payment from any third
Person obligated by Contract or otherwise to reimburse, indemnify or pay the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Adverse Consequences.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or any applicable Law to the
contrary, it is understood and agreed by each of the Parties that no
stockholder, member, partner, manager, officer, director, employee,
consultant, agent, representative or Affiliate of any Party hereto shall have
(i) any personal liability to any Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party as a result of the breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or otherwise
arising out of or in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, or (ii)
any personal obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party or any
Seller Indemnified Party for any claims pursuant to this _Article X_ , and
Buyer, for itself and all other Buyer Indemnified Parties and each Seller, for
itself and all other Seller Indemnified Parties, hereby waive and release and
shall have no recourse against any of such Persons described in this _Section_
__ _ 10.5(g)_ as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein or otherwise arising out of or in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions. An Indemnified Party shall use
Reasonable Efforts to mitigate all Adverse Consequences relating to an
indemnifiable claim, including availing itself of any defenses, limitations,
rights of contribution, and other rights at law or equity, and shall provide
such evidence and documentation of the nature and extent of such claim as may
be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party. An Indemnified
Partys Reasonable Efforts shall include the reasonable expenditure of money,
including the payment of any legal fees, to mitigate or otherwise reduce or
eliminate any Adverse Consequences for which indemnification would otherwise
be due under this  _Article X_.

 



61

    

(h) An Indemnifying Partys indemnification obligations under this  _Article
X_ shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the extent that the Adverse
Consequences related to a claim is covered by and paid to the Indemnified
Party pursuant to (A) a reimbursement, indemnification or payment from a
third Person with respect to such Adverse Consequences, or (B) insurance
policies that provide coverage with respect to such Adverse Consequences.

PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST INCOME, LOSS OF USE OR BUSINESS REPUTATION OR
OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA, FAILURE TO REALIZE SAVINGS OR BENEFITS, OR ANY
DAMAGES BASED ON OR MEASURED BY ANY TYPE OF MULTIPLE, AND THE DEFINITION OF

DAMAGES) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENT, EVEN IF
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS.

Section 10.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Seller and Buyer agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this _Article X_ as an adjustment

will be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

either alone or together with any Persons Buyer has retained to advise it with

ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE

AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT A PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION RESULTING FROM, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY

THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 11.11_.

 

Section 11.12 No Joint Venture. Nothing in this Agreement creates or is
intended to create an association, trust, partnership, joint venture or other

partnership or fiduciary duty, obligation, or liability on or with respect to
the Parties. Except as expressly provided herein, neither Party is or shall
act as or be the agent or representative of the other Party.

Section 11.13 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Contemplated Transactions is not affected in any manner
adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in order that the Contemplated
Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
possible.

 

Section 11.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by facsimile transmission
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement.

Section 11.15 Specific Enforcement. The Parties agree that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage would occur for which monetary damages would
not be an adequate remedy in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties agree that, if for any reason
any Party shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement or
otherwise breached this Agreement, then the Party seeking to enforce this
Agreement against such nonperforming Party under this Agreement shall be
entitled to specific performance and the issuance of immediate injunctive and
other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of
money damages as a remedy, and the Parties further agree to waive
any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with
the obtaining of any such injunctive or other equitable relief, this being in
addition to and not in limitation of any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. If any Party brings any Action to enforce
specifically the performance of the

 



67

    

 terms and provisions of this Agreement when expressly available to such
Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein, the Termination Date shall automatically be extended
by the period of time between the commencement of such Claim and ten (10)
Business Days following the date on which such Claim is fully and finally
resolved.

 

Section 11.16 Legal Representation. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that Sellers Counsel has acted as
counsel for Seller and its Affiliates, and that Seller reasonably anticipate
that Sellers Counsel will continue to represent Seller and its Affiliates in
future matters. Accordingly, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates,
expressly consents to: (a) Sellers Counsel representation of Seller and its
Affiliates, in any post-Closing matter in which the interests of Buyer, on the
one hand, and Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand, are adverse,
including any matter relating to the Contemplated Transactions or any
disagreement or dispute relating thereto, and whether or not such matter is
one in which Sellers Counsel may have previously advised Seller or
its Affiliates, and (b) the disclosure by Sellers Counsel to Seller or its
Affiliates, as applicable, of any information learned by Sellers Counsel in
the course of its representation of Seller or its Affiliates, as applicable,
whether or not such information is subject to attorney-client privilege or
Sellers Counsels duty of confidentiality. Furthermore, Buyer, on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, (1) irrevocably waives any right it may have to
discover or obtain information or documentation relating to the
representation of Seller and its Affiliates by Sellers Counsel in the
Contemplated Transactions, to the extent that such information or
documentation was privileged as to Seller or its Affiliates (" _Confidential
Communications_ "), and (2) agrees that (i) the privilege with respect to such
Confidential Communications shall remain with Seller following the Closing
such that, without limiting Sellers rights to such privilege, Seller alone
shall have and maintain the right to waive the privilege, (ii) if Sellers
former officers or managers leave any emails or other documents (both
electronic or otherwise) that contain Confidential Communications on the
servers of any Sale Entity or the JV Company, such occurrence shall not
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or any other privilege
applicable to such documents, and (iii) to the extent any emails or other
documents (either electronic or otherwise) containing any Confidential
Communications are included in the computer server(s) of any Sale Entity or
the JV Company or are otherwise within the records of the Sale Entities and
the JV Company following the Closing, it will, upon discovery of any such
documents, permanently delete or destroy all such emails or other documents
containing such Confidential Communication and not review, disclose, or
otherwise use such documents or the Confidential Communications for any
purpose. Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, further covenants and
agrees that each shall not assert any claim against Sellers Counsel in
respect of legal services provided to the Sale Entities or the JV Company by
Sellers Counsel in connection with this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions. If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing,
Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall have the right to assert or waive any
attorney-client privilege with respect to any communication between Seller or
its Affiliates and any Person representing them that occurred at any time
prior to the Closing, Buyer, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, shall be
entitled to waive such privilege only with the prior written consent of
Sellers Counsel and Seller.

primary obligor and not merely as a surety, the obligations of Seller set
forth in _Sections 2.1(b)_ and _9.2_ (such obligations, the " _Seller
Guaranteed Obligations_ "). The Seller Guaranteed Obligations are primary,
absolute, unconditional and irrevocable. Guarantor acknowledges and agrees
that its obligations hereunder shall continue in full force and effect,
without notice from any other party in the event the obligations of Seller
