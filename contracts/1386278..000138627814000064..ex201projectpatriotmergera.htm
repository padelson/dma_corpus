AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of

company (the "Company"), Torrey Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company, solely in its capacity as the initial Holder Representative
hereunder, and the Persons delivering Joinder Agreements herewith.

RECITALS

A. The Boards of Directors (or other similar governing bodies) of each of
Parent, the Company and Merger Sub have (i) determined that the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company with the Company continuing as the
surviving entity (the "Merger") would be advisable and fair to, and in the
best interests of, their respective stockholders or members, as applicable,
and (ii) approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement pursuant to the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act
(the "DLLCA").

B. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each Holder has executed
and delivered a joinder agreement substantially in the form attached as
Exhibit A hereto (each, a "Joinder Agreement").

Agreement, those Holders who are listed on Exhibit B-1 hereto (the "Key

accepting employee offer letters (the "Employee Offer Letters") and each
Holder who is listed on Exhibit B-2 is entering into a non-competition

or exchange of shares, then the Parent Stock Price, the Closing Stock
Consideration and the Escrow Amount and any other number in this Agreement
based on the number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding or the Parent
Stock Price shall be correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares; and

(ii) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any Unit
or Company Warrant shall be retired or otherwise shall cease to be outstanding
due to the forfeiture, cancellation or expiration thereof pursuant to the
terms thereof, then the Merger Consideration otherwise payable in respect of
such Unit or Company Warrant as set forth on the



Consideration Spreadsheet shall be reallocated ratably to the other Holders in
accordance with their respective Pro Rata Percentages.

(b) Any transferee or assignee of a Holder shall receive the Merger
Consideration applicable to the Units and/or Company Warrants so assigned or
transferred as set forth on the Consideration Spreadsheet (or as otherwise
specified in Section 2.9(a)).

Section 2.10 Exchange and Payment.

(a) On the Closing Date, Parent shall:

(i) (A) issue (or cause to be issued) to each Holder book-entry shares
representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock constituting the portion of
the Closing Stock Consideration owed for such Holder's Units and/or Company
Warrants, and (B) pay each Holder an amount in cash representing the cash
consideration to which such Holder may be entitled on account of a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock, which such Holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, as set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet; provided, that for the purposes hereof, all
fractional shares that a Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive as a
result of the Merger will be aggregated so that no Holder has more than one
fractional share with respect to all of its Units and Company Warrants
combined; and

(ii) pay or cause to be paid to each Holder of Units or Company Warrants an
amount in cash equal to the portion of the Closing Cash Consideration owed for
such Holder's Units and Company Warrants as set forth on the Consideration
Spreadsheet.

(b) No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each Holder of Units or Company Warrants otherwise
entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock, upon conversion of
his or her Units and/or Company Warrants pursuant to Section 2.7 and Section
2.8, or upon any subsequent payment pursuant to Section 2.14 or Section 8.7,
be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without interest) determined by
multiplying the Parent Stock Price by the fractional share interest to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled. The parties acknowledge that payment
of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares was not
separately bargained for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical
rounding off for purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting
complexities that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional
shares.

(c) All payments of cash to be made under this Agreement to a Holder shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated by such Holder in such Holder's Joinder Agreement, except as
otherwise agreed by the payor and payee prior to such payment (in which case
all such wire transfer instructions shall be provided to the Surviving Company
at least two Business Days prior to the applicable payment date); provided,
however, that all payments of cash to a Holder that are treated as wages, if
any, shall be made by the Surviving Company utilizing the Company's payroll
system.

Section 2.11 Other Closing Payments; Closing Deliveries.



(a) Concurrently with the Effective Time, Parent shall pay or deposit, or
cause to be paid or deposited:

(i) with the Escrow Agent for deposit into the Escrow Fund, the Escrow Amount;

(ii) on behalf of the Company, the amount payable to each Person who is owed a
portion of the Transaction Expenses reflected in the Estimated Net Working
Capital, as specified in the Transaction Expenses Payoff Instructions and in

Indebtedness and terminate all applicable obligations and liabilities of the
Company and any of its Affiliates related thereto, as specified in the Debt
Payoff Letters and in accordance with this Agreement; and

(iv) to the Holder Representative, the Holder Representative Expense Fund, in
accordance with Section 2.15.

(b) All payments under this Section 2.11 shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in United States dollars to such account as may be
designated to the payor by the payee at least two Business Days prior to the
applicable payment date.

(c) At the Closing, Parent shall deliver to the Company an executed
counterpart of each of the Ancillary Agreements, signed by Parent.

Section 2.12 Consideration Spreadsheet.

(a) The Company has prepared and delivered to Parent a spreadsheet attached
hereto as Exhibit H (the "Signing Spreadsheet"), certified by an authorized
Person of the Company on behalf of the Company, setting forth for each record
Holder of any Units or Company Warrants:

(i) the name, address (including email address) and, where available, tax
identification number of such Holder;

(ii) the number and type of Units held by such Holder;

(iii) with respect to Company Incentive Units, the threshold value for such
Company Incentive Units;

(iv) the number of Company Warrants held by such Holder and the exercise price
for such Company Warrants;

(v) such holder's Pro Rata Percentage determined as of the date hereof;



(vi) the amount of cash payable to such Holder pursuant to Section 2.7 and
Section 2.8 as Closing Cash Consideration for its Units and Company Warrants
based on the preliminary statement of Net Working Capital as of June 30, 2014
attached as Exhibit I (the "Preliminary NWC Statement");

(vii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such Holder
pursuant to Section 2.7 and Section 2.8 as Closing Stock Consideration (and
any cash payable to such holder in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock) for its Units and Company Warrants;

(viii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be deposited in respect
of such Holder's Units and Company Warrants into the Escrow Fund;

(ix) the amount of cash in respect of such Holder's Units and Company Warrants
to be paid toward the Holder Representative Expense Fund; and

(x) the amount of tax, if any, required by Law to be withheld from any
consideration payable to such Holder as of the date hereof (including taxes
required to be withheld in respect of amounts deposited in the Holder
Representative Expense Fund).

(b) Concurrently with the delivery of the Preliminary Closing Statement
pursuant to Section 2.13, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent an
updated Signing Spreadsheet (as so updated, the "Consideration Spreadsheet"),
certified by an authorized Person of the Company on behalf of the Company,
that recalculates the information set forth in clause (a) with respect to each
Holder based on the Estimated Net Working Capital. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the Company LLC Agreement or otherwise, but subject to Section
2.9, all amounts and allocations set forth in the Consideration Spreadsheet
shall be conclusive and binding on all parties. In the event of any
inconsistency between the Consideration Spreadsheet and any provision of the
Company LLC Agreement or any other document, the Consideration Spreadsheet
shall control in all respects.

Section 2.13 Closing Estimates; Pre-Closing Deliveries.

(a) At least five Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Parent a
written statement (the "Preliminary Closing Statement") that shall include and
set forth (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, including all notes thereto, dated as of the Closing Date (the
"Preliminary Closing Balance Sheet") and (ii) a good-faith estimate of Net
Working Capital based on the Applicable Accounting Principles (the "Estimated
Net Working Capital") (with Estimated Net Working Capital determined as of the
Effective Time and, except for estimated Transaction Expenses reflected
therein, without giving effect to the Transactions) and (iii) on the basis of
the foregoing, a calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration. Estimated
Net Working Capital shall be calculated in accordance with the accounting
principles set forth on Exhibit J (the "Applicable Accounting Principles").
All calculations of Estimated Net Working Capital shall be accompanied by a
certificate of the Company's Chief Financial Officer certifying that such
estimates have been calculated in good faith in accordance with this
Agreement. The Company will provide Parent and its Representatives with access
to the books



and records of the Company and to any other documents or information relating
to the preparation of the Preliminary Closing Statement or calculation of
amounts reflected thereon reasonably requested by Parent or its
Representatives, and to the Company's employees responsible for and
knowledgeable about the information used therein, and the preparation or
calculation thereof. Without limiting any of Parent's other rights or
remedies, Parent may object that any of the foregoing has not been calculated
in good faith or in a manner consistent with the terms hereof by delivering to
the Company a written notice of its disagreement at least two Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing Date (the "Parent's Notice of Disagreement"),
specifying in reasonable detail the nature of its objections to the Company's
estimates and attaching reasonable and customary information relating to the
calculation of amounts reflected in such Parent's Notice of Disagreement,
accompanied by a certificate of Parent's Chief Financial Officer certifying
that such objections have been calculated in good faith in accordance with
this Agreement. The Company and Parent in good faith shall seek to resolve in
writing any objections set forth in Parent's Notice of Disagreement prior to
the Closing, and the Company shall make such revisions to the disputed items
as may be mutually agreed between the Company and Parent; provided, that if
and to the extent that Parent and the Company have not resolved all such
differences by the close of business on the Business Day prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, the Closing will proceed and Parent's figures will
control for Closing purposes. For the avoidance of doubt, any failure of
Parent to raise any objection or dispute in Parent's Notice of Disagreement
shall not in any way prejudice Parent's right to raise any matter in the Final
Closing Statement.

(b) At least two Business Days prior to the Closing, with respect to any
Transaction Expenses which will not have been paid in full prior to the
Closing, the Company shall submit to Parent documentation setting forth an
itemized list of all, and amounts of all, Transaction Expenses, including the
identity of each payee, dollar amounts owed, wire instructions and any other
information necessary to effect the final payment in full thereof and copies
of final invoices from each such payee acknowledging the invoiced amounts as
full and final payment for all services rendered to the Company (and as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Company) or its Subsidiaries through the
Effective Time and estimated to be rendered following the Effective Time (the
"Transaction Expenses Payoff Instructions").

Section 2.14 Post-Closing Adjustment of Merger Consideration.

(a) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Surviving Company shall prepare
and deliver to the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Holders) a written
statement (the "Final Closing Statement") that shall include and set forth (i)
a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including
all notes thereto, dated as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"),
and (ii) a calculation of the actual Net Working Capital (the "Closing Net
Working Capital") (with Closing Net Working Capital determined as of the
Effective Time and, except for Transaction Expenses reflected therein, without
giving effect to the Transactions). Closing Net Working Capital shall be
calculated in accordance with the Applicable Accounting Principles.

(b) The Final Closing Statement shall become final and binding on the 60th day
following delivery thereof, unless prior to the end of such period, the Holder
Representative delivers to Parent written notice of its disagreement (a
"Notice of Disagreement") specifying the



nature and amount of any dispute as to the Closing Net Working Capital as set
forth in the Final Closing Statement. The Holder Representative shall be
deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts of Closing Net Working
Capital not specifically referenced in the Notice of Disagreement, and such
items and amounts shall not be subject to review in accordance with Section
2.14(c). Any Notice of Disagreement may reference only disagreements based on
mathematical errors or that the Closing Net Working Capital as reflected on
the Final Closing Statement was not calculated in accordance with this
Agreement and the applicable definitions set forth in this Agreement.

(c) During the 15-day period following delivery of a Notice of Disagreement by
the Holder Representative to Parent, the parties in good faith shall seek to
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the
computation of the Closing Net Working Capital as specified therein. Any
disputed items resolved in writing between the Holder Representative and
Parent within such 15 day period shall be final and binding with respect to
such items, and if the Holder Representative and Parent agree in writing on
the resolution of each disputed item specified by the Holder Representative in
the Notice of Disagreement and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital,
the amounts so determined shall be final and binding on the parties for all
purposes hereunder. If the Holder Representative and Parent have not resolved
all such differences by the end of such 15 day period, the Holder
Representative and Parent shall submit, in writing, to an independent public
accounting firm (the "Independent Accounting Firm"), their briefs detailing
their views as to the correct nature and amount of each item remaining in
dispute and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, and the Independent
Accounting Firm shall make a written determination as to each such disputed
item and the amount of the Closing Net Working Capital, which determination
shall be final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts in the
Holder Representative's and Parent's respective calculations of the Closing
Net Working Capital that are identified as being items and amounts to which
the Holder Representative and Parent have been unable to agree. In resolving
any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to
any item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party
or less than the least value for such item claimed by either party. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be the New York City office of Deloitte LLP
or, if such firm is unable or unwilling to act, such other independent public
accounting firm as shall be agreed in writing by the Holder Representative and
Parent. The Holder Representative and Parent shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to render a
written decision resolving the matters submitted to it within 30 days
following the submission thereof. Judgment may be entered upon the written
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with Section
10.10. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm will be
entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.

(d) The costs of any dispute resolution pursuant to Section 2.14(c), including
the fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm and of any
enforcement of the determination thereof, shall be borne by the Holder
Representative and Parent in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the
matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be determined by the
Independent Accounting Firm at the time the determination of such firm is
rendered on the merits of the matters



submitted; provided, however, that if a party asserts a meritless position in
such dispute (which shall be determined solely by the Independent Accounting
Firm), the Independent Accounting Firm shall award the other party an amount
equal to three times its reasonable and documented attorneys' and accountants'
fees and costs and related out-of-pocket expenses incurred in resolving such
meritless dispute, which shall be paid in full, in cash, not later than ten
Business Days after the Independent Accounting Firm's determination (i) that
attorneys' and accountants' fees and costs and related out-of-pocket expenses
are required to be awarded and (ii) the amount of such attorneys' and
accountants' fees and costs and other out-of-pocket expenses payable. The fees
and disbursements of the Representatives of each party incurred in connection
with the preparation or review of the Final Closing Statement and preparation
or review of any Notice of Disagreement, as applicable, shall be borne by such
party.

(e) The Company shall, during the period prior to the Closing Date, and
Parent, during the period from and after the date of delivery of the Final
Closing Statement through the resolution of any adjustment to the purchase
price contemplated by this Section 2.14 shall cause the Surviving Company to,
afford Parent or the Holder Representative, as the case may be, and their
respective Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and
upon reasonable prior written notice, to the personnel, properties, books and
records of the Company or the Surviving Company, as the case may be, and its
Subsidiaries and to any other information reasonably requested for purposes of
preparing and reviewing the calculations contemplated by this Section 2.14.
Each party shall authorize and instruct its accountants to disclose work
papers generated by such accountants in connection with preparing and
reviewing the calculation of the Net Working Capital as specified in this
Section 2.14; provided, that such accountants shall only be obligated to make
any work papers available after the non-client party has signed a customary
agreement relating to access to such work papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

(f) Following the determination of the Final Net Working Capital pursuant to
this Section 2.14, the Closing Merger Consideration will be recomputed by
using the Final Net Working Capital instead of the Estimated Net Working
Capital in determining the Working Capital Underage. If the Closing Merger
Consideration, as recomputed, exceeds the Closing Merger Consideration
determined as of the Closing Date, then Parent will, within three Business
Days after the determination of the Final Net Working Capital, pay each Holder
an amount equal to such Holder's Pro Rata Percentage of such excess. If the
Closing Merger Consideration, as recomputed, is less than the Closing Merger
Consideration determined as of the Closing Date, then each Holder will, within
three Business Days after the determination of the Final Net Working Capital,
pay Parent by wire transfer to such accounts and pursuant to such instructions
as are furnished by Parent to the Holder Representative an amount equal to
such Holder's Pro Rata Percentage of such shortfall. In the event any Holder
fails to pay such Holder's Pro Rata Percentage of such shortfall within five
Business Days after notice of the determination of the Final Net Working
Capital is delivered to such Holder, Parent shall be authorized to deliver
written notice to the Escrow Agent and the Holder Representative specifying
the amount of such deficiency, and the Escrow Agent shall distribute shares of
Parent Common Stock equal in value to such amount (but only up to such
Holder's Pro Rata Percentage of the Escrow Fund, with such shares of Parent
Common Stock distributed from the Escrow Fund being valued at the Parent Stock
Price) out of the Escrow Fund to Parent in accordance with the terms of the
Escrow Agreement and neither the Holder Representative nor any Holder shall be
entitled to object to



such claim against the Escrow Fund; provided, that (A) such Holder shall
promptly pay to the Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to such amount
distributed from the Escrow Fund, and (B) such Holder shall remain liable to
Parent in the event such Holder's Pro Rata Percentage of the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to cover the amount of such deficiency or if the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to cover any indemnification payment awarded to Parent pursuant
to Article VIII as a result of the failure of such Holder to pay to the Escrow
Fund such Holder's Pro Rata Percentage of such deficiency pursuant to Clause
(A) (but only up to the amount distributed to Parent from such Holder's Pro
Rata Percentage of the Escrow Fund).

Section 2.15 Holder Representative Expense Fund.

(a) On the Closing Date, Parent shall pay, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, to the Holder Representative cash in the amount of $1,500,000
(the "Holder Representative Expense Fund") to cover reasonable documented out-
of-pocket fees and expenses that may be incurred by the Holder Representative
following the Closing acting in such capacity (collectively "Charges"). Other
than the Holder Representative Expense Fund, in no event shall Parent or its
Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries, be responsible for payment of any expenses of the Holder
Representative (including any fees and disbursements of Willkie Farr and
Gallagher LLP incurred following the Closing in connection with the
Transactions). If the amount deposited into the Holder Representative Expense
Fund in respect of any Holder is subject to tax withholding, then
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amount otherwise payable
to such Holder at the Closing shall be reduced and such amount shall be
deposited in the Holder Representative Expense Fund in respect of such Holder
so that the Holder Representative Expense Fund equals the amount that would
have be so deposited absent such withholding.

(b) The Holder Representative shall have the right to recover from, in its
sole discretion, the Holder Representative Expense Fund, prior to any
distribution to the Holders, the Charges incurred by the Holder
Representative. If the Holder Representative Expense Fund is insufficient to
cover the Charges incurred by the Holder Representative, the Holder
Representative shall have the right to recover such shortfall (i) first, from
the Escrow Fund, the 2015 Earnout Amount, the 2016 Earnout Amount and the 2017
Earnout Amount, amounts that are otherwise distributable to the Holders (but
only to the extent such amounts become distributable to the Holders, at such
times and subject to such contingencies as set forth in Article VIII and
Section 2.16), and (ii) second, directly from the Holders pro rata based on
each Holder's Pro Rata Percentage. The Holder Representative shall not be
obligated to incur charges not covered by the Holder Representative Expense
Fund. Upon final resolution of all liabilities and obligations of the Holders
under this Agreement and full reimbursement of all Charges of the Holder
Representative as provided herein, in each case, as determined in the Holder
Representative's sole discretion, the Holder Representative shall distribute
any remaining portion of the Holder Representative Expense Fund to the Holders
pro rata in accordance with each Holder's Pro Rata Percentage.

Section 2.16 Earnout Consideration. In accordance with the Earnout Provisions,
following each of June 30, 2015, June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017, each Holder
shall be entitled to receive such Holder's Pro Rata Percentage of the 2015
Earnout Amount, the 2016 Earnout



Amount and the 2017 Earnout Amount, in each case to the extent payable in
accordance with the provisions of Annex A (the "Earnout Provisions").

Section 2.17 Withholding Rights. Notwithstanding any provision contained
herein to the contrary, each of the Parent, Escrow Agent and the Surviving
Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it reasonably
determines it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of Tax Law. Any such withholding (including
any withholding attributable to Parent Common Stock) shall be deducted from
the cash portion of the consideration payable to the recipient and,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent the cash
portion is not sufficient to satisfy such withholding, the payment of the non-
cash portion shall be conditioned on the recipient paying to Parent, Escrow
Agent and the Surviving Company (as applicable) cash in the amount of such
withholding. If Parent, Escrow Agent or the Surviving Company, as the case may
be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made. Prior to withholding any Taxes under this
Section 2.17, Parent shall (i) notify the Holder Representative of any
anticipated withholding by Parent, (ii) consult with the Holder Representative
in good faith to determine whether such deduction and withholding is required
under applicable Tax Law, and (iii) cooperate with the Holder Representative
in good faith to minimize the amount of any such withholding; provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the payment of
any such withholding amount to the recipient may be delayed pending resolution
of the treatment thereof, and this sentence shall not apply to backup
withholding or withholding with respect to amounts treated as wages. Each of
Parent, the Holders and the Holder Representative acknowledge that, as of the
date of this Agreement, it is not aware of withholding under Tax Law required
to be made from the amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement, other than as set forth in the Signing Spreadsheet pursuant to
Section 2.12(a)(x) hereof or with respect to backup withholding or withholding
with respect to amounts treated as wages.

Section 2.18 Holder Representative.

(a) The Holders irrevocably appoint and constitute Torrey Holdings, LLC as
agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution, to act on
behalf of the Holders for certain limited purposes, as specified herein (the
"Holder Representative"), including the full power and authority to act on the
Holders' behalf as provided in Section 2.18(b). The Holders, by approving this
Agreement, further agree that such agency, proxy and attorney-in-fact are
coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the
Holder Representative, except as provided in Section 2.18(c), and shall be
binding upon the successors, heirs, executors, administers and legal
representatives of each Holder and shall not be affected by, and shall
survive, the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any
Holder. All decisions, actions, consents and instructions by the Holder
Representative shall be binding upon all of the Holders, and no Holder shall
have the right to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest any
such decision, action, consent or instruction. Parent and Merger Sub shall be
entitled to rely on any decision, action, consent or instruction of the Holder
Representative as being the decision, action, consent or instruction of the
Holders, and Parent and Merger Sub are



hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for acts done by them in
accordance with any such decision, act, consent or instruction.

(b) The Holder Representative shall have such powers and authority as are
necessary to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Holder Representative
shall have full power, authority and discretion to (i) consummate the
Transactions (including pursuant to Section 2.14 hereof); (ii) negotiate
disputes arising under, or relating to, this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements (including pursuant to Section 2.14 and Article VIII hereof); (iii)
receive and disburse to the Holders any funds received on behalf of the
Holders under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (including pursuant
to Section 2.14, Section 2.15, Section 2.16 and Article VIII hereof); (iv)
withhold any amounts received on behalf of the Holders under this Agreement or
otherwise to satisfy any and all obligations or liabilities incurred by the
Holders or the Holder Representative in the performance of their duties
hereunder (including pursuant to Section 2.14, Section 2.15, Section 2.16,
Section 2.17 and Article VIII hereof); (v) execute and deliver any amendment
or waiver to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (without the prior
approval of the Holders); and (vi) to take all other actions to be taken by or
on behalf of the Holders in connection with this Agreement (including pursuant
to Section 2.14, Section 2.15, Section 2.16 and Article VIII hereof) and the
Ancillary Agreements. The Holder Representative shall have no duties or
obligations hereunder, including any fiduciary duties, except those set forth
herein, and such duties and obligations shall be determined solely by the
express provisions of this Agreement.

(c) The Holder Representative may resign at any time, and may be removed for
any reason or no reason by the vote or written consent of Members holding a
majority of the Units as of the Effective Time (the "Majority Holders"), with
the prior consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably withheld. In the event of
the death, incapacity, resignation or removal of the Holder Representative, a
new Holder Representative shall be appointed by the vote or written consent of
the Majority Holders, with the prior consent of Parent, not to be unreasonably
withheld. Notice of such vote or a copy of the written consent appointing such
new Holder Representative shall be sent to Parent and, after the Effective
Time, to the Surviving Company, such appointment to be effective upon the
later of the date indicated in such consent or the date such consent is
received by Parent and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Company;
provided, that until such notice is received, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Company, as applicable, shall be entitled to rely on the decisions,
actions, consents and instructions of the prior Holder Representative as
described in Section 2.18(a).

(d) The Holder Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from funds
paid to it under Section 2.15 of this Agreement and/or otherwise received by
it in its capacity as the Holder Representative pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement, for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
(including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and
consultants) incurred by the Holder Representative in such capacity; provided,
that, other than the payment contemplated under Section 2.15 hereof, neither
Parent nor the Company nor its Subsidiaries shall have any monetary obligation
or liability to the Holder Representative.



(e) Each Holder, severally but not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Holder Representative and its partners, managers, officers,
agents and other representatives from and against its Pro Rata Percentage of
any losses, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines and amounts incurred by such Persons arising out of actions
taken or omitted to be taken in the Holder Representative's capacity as the
Holder Representative (except for those arising out of the Holder
Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs
and expenses of investigation and defense of claims.

(f) All acts of the Holder Representative hereunder in its capacity as such
shall be deemed to be acts on behalf of the Holders and not of the Holder
Representative individually. The Holder Representative, in its capacity as
such, shall not have any liability for any amount owed to Parent or any other
Person pursuant to this Agreement. The Holder Representative shall not be
liable to the Company, the Surviving Company, Parent, the Merger Sub or any
other Person in his or its capacity as the Holder Representative, for any
liability of a Holder or otherwise, or for anything which it may do or refrain
from doing in such capacity in connection with this Agreement. The Holder
Representative shall not be liable to the Holders, in its capacity as the
Holder Representative, for any liability of a Holder or otherwise, or for any
error of judgment, or any act done or step taken or omitted by it in good
faith, or for any mistake in fact or Law, or for anything which it may do or
refrain from doing in connection with this Agreement, except in the case of
the Holder Representative's gross negligence or willful misconduct as
determined in a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Holder Representative may seek the advice of legal counsel
in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction of any of the
provisions of this Agreement or its duties or rights hereunder, and it shall
incur no liability in its capacity as the Holder Representative to the Parent,
Surviving Company, the Merger Sub, the Company, the Holders or any other
Person and shall be held harmless by the Holders with respect to any action
taken, omitted or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with the advice
of such counsel. The Holder Representative in such capacity shall not by
reason of this Agreement have a fiduciary relationship in respect of any
Holder, except in respect of amounts received on behalf of the Holders.

ARTICLE III 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
OF THE COMPANY

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
Disclosure Schedules and after giving effect to the provisions of Section
10.23, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as
follows:

Section 3.1 Organization and Qualification.

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is (i) a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation as set forth on Schedule 3.1(a) of
the Disclosure Schedules, and has full limited liability company power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now conducted and (ii) duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
limited liability company to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the



properties and assets occupied, owned, leased or operated by it or the nature
of its business as presently conducted makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, except, with respect to clause (ii), for any such failures to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has heretofore furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy
of the certificate of formation and limited liability company operating
agreement or equivalent organizational documents, each as amended to date, of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries. Such certificates of formation,
limited liability company operating agreements or equivalent organizational
documents are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of
formation, limited liability company operating agreement or equivalent
organizational documents.

(c) The Company LLC Agreement as of the date hereof is set forth on Exhibit K,
and there exists no plan, arrangement, agreement or understanding to amend,

Section 3.10 Employee Benefit Plans.

(a) Schedule 3.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedules sets forth a true and
complete list of all material Plans. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Plan"

Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and all bonus,
stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, incentive, deferred
compensation, retiree medical or life insurance, supplemental retirement,
severance or other benefit plans, programs or arrangements, and all
employment, termination, severance or other similar compensatory Contracts or
agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, with

expected to have any obligation or liability or which are maintained,
contributed to or sponsored by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the
benefit of any current or former employee, officer or director of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries;

(ii) each employee benefit plan for which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to incur liability under Section
4069 of ERISA in the event such plan has been or were to be terminated; and

(iii) any plan in respect of which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
could reasonably be expected to incur liability under Section 4212(c) of
ERISA.

(b) With respect to each Plan set forth on Section 3.10(a) of the Disclosure
Schedules, the Company has furnished or made available to Parent a true and
complete copy of each Plan (to the extent in writing, or a written description
thereof if not in writing) and has delivered to Parent a true and complete
copy of each material document, if any, prepared in connection with each such
Plan, including (i) a copy of each trust or other funding arrangement, (ii)
each summary plan description and summary of material modifications, (iii) the
two most recently filed Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 5500, (iv) with
respect to each Plan intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the most recently
received IRS determination letter or opinion letter for such Plan and (v) the
most recently prepared actuarial report and financial statement in connection
with each such Plan.

(c) None of the Plans is a multiemployer plan within the meaning of Section
3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "Multiemployer Plan") or a single employer
pension plan within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA for which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries could incur liability under Section 4063 or
4064 of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer Plan"). None of the Plans provide for or
promise retiree medical, disability or life insurance benefits to any current
or former employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except as required by applicable Law. Each of the Plans is
maintained in the United States and is subject only to the Laws of the United
States or a political subdivision thereof.

(d) This Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions contemplated
hereby shall not, except as set forth on Schedule 3.10(d), result in (i) the
payment of separation,



severance, termination or similar type of benefits to any person; (ii) the
acceleration, increase, or vesting of any amounts payable pursuant to any
Plan, except as contemplated hereby

(e) None of the Plans: (i) provides for the payment of separation, severance,
termination or similar type benefits to any person; (ii) obligates the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to pay separation, severance, termination or
similar type benefits solely or partially as a result of the Transactions
contemplated hereby; or (iii) obligates the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to make any payment or provide any benefit as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(f) Each Plan is now and always has been operated in all material respects in
accordance with its terms and the requirements of all applicable Laws,
including ERISA and the Code, including Section 409A of the Code. With respect
to each Plan, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in all material
respects, has performed all obligations required to be performed by it and is
not in any respect in material default under or in material violation under
any Plan, nor does the Company have any knowledge of any such material default
or material breach by any other party to any Plan. No Action is pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to any Plan which would
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability, other than claims
for benefits in the ordinary course, and no fact or event exists that would
give rise to any such Action.

(g) Each Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code or Section 401(k) of the Code has received a favorable determination or
opinion letter from the IRS that it is so qualified and that its related trust
is exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code. To
the knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has occurred since the date of
such determination letter or opinion letters from the IRS that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
Plan or the exempt status of any such trust.

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, there has not been any prohibited
transaction, within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code, with respect to any Plan that could reasonably be expected to result in
a material liability to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any liability under, arising
out of or by operation of Title IV of ERISA, which has not been satisfied in
full, other than liability for premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation arising in the ordinary course, including any liability in
connection with (i) the termination or reorganization of any employee benefit
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or (ii) the withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, and no fact or event exists that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any such liability.

(i) All contributions, premiums or payments required to be made with respect
to any Plan by applicable Law or the terms of such Plan have been made on or
before their due dates, or to the extent not yet due have been appropriately
reflected on the financial statements of the Company. All such contributions
have been fully deducted for income tax purposes. No such deduction has been
challenged or disallowed by any Governmental Authority and no fact or event
exists that would give rise to any such challenge or disallowance. As of the
latest actuarial



report, no Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA will have an "unfunded
benefit liability" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA.

(j) No Plan or any related trust or other funding medium thereunder or any
fiduciary thereof is, to the knowledge of the Company, the subject of an
audit, investigation or examination by any Governmental Authority that would
reasonably be expected to result in a material liability to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

(k) With respect to each Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA: (i) no "reportable
event" (as such term is used in Section 4043 of ERISA, other than an event for
which the reporting requirements have been waived by regulations), (ii) no
application for or receipt of a waiver from the IRS of any minimum funding
requirement under Section 412 of the Code has been submitted with respect to
any Plan.

(l) Each Plan which is a "group health plan," as such term is defined in
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code has been administered and operated in all
material respects in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section
601 of ERISA, Section 4980B(b) of the Code and the applicable provisions of
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1986.

(m) With respect to each Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation
plan" (as defined for purposes of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code), (i) the
document or documents that evidence each such plan or arrangement have
conformed in all material respects to the provisions of Section 409A of the
Code and the final regulations under Section 409A of the Code since December
31, 2008; and (ii) as to any such plan or arrangement that was in existence
prior to January 1, 2005 and that is not subject to Section 409A of the Code
under the "grandfather" provisions of IRS Notice 2005-1 and applicable
treasury regulations under Section 409A of the Code, has not been "materially
modified" (within the meaning of IRS Notice 2005-1 and applicable treasury
regulations under Section 409A of the Code) at any time after October 3, 2004.

(n) The Company is not obligated to make any payments in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
combination with any other events), including under any Plan, that will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

Section 3.11 Labor and Employment Matters.

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any labor or
collective bargaining Contract that pertains to employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. There are no, and since January 1, 2011 there have
been no, organizing activities or collective bargaining arrangements that
could affect the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or under
discussion with any labor organization or group of employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. There is no, and since January 1, 2011 there has been
no, labor strike, controversy, slowdown, work stoppage or lockout pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against or affecting the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is there any
basis for any of the foregoing. Neither the Company nor any of its



Subsidiaries has materially breached or otherwise failed to materially comply
with the provisions of any collective bargaining or union Contract in which
the Company or any Subsidiary is a party. There are no pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened union grievances or union representation
questions against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries involving employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) The Company is and during the past five years has been in compliance in
all material respects with all applicable Laws respecting employment,
including discrimination or harassment in employment, terms and conditions of
employment, termination of employment, wages, overtime classification, hours,
occupational safety and health, employee whistle-blowing, unfair labor
practices, immigration, employee privacy, employment practices and
classification of employees, consultants and independent contractors. No
unfair labor practice or labor charge or complaint is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries before the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission or any other Governmental Authority.

(c) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have paid in full all wages,
salaries, commissions, bonuses, benefits and other compensation that have
become payable.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any Governmental
Authority relating to employees or employment practices. None of the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their executive officers has received
within the past five years any notice of intent by any Governmental Authority
responsible for the enforcement of labor or employment laws to conduct an
investigation relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the
knowledge of the Company, no such investigation is in progress.

and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 4.4 Financing. Parent affirms that it is not a condition to the
Closing or to any of its other obligations under this Agreement that Parent
obtain financing for, or related to, any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of an
executed commitment letter and fee letter (provided, that provisions in the
commitment letter and the fee letter related solely to fees, pricing caps and
the economic terms of the "market flex" sections thereof agreed to by the
parties may be redacted (none of which redacted provisions adversely affect
the availability of or impose additional conditions on, the availability of
Bank Financing (as defined below) at the Closing (such commitment letter and
related term sheets, including all exhibits, schedules and annexes thereto and
such fee letter, as the same may be amended, collectively, the "Bank Financing
Commitments"), pursuant to which the lender parties thereto have agreed,
subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to provide or cause to be
provided up to $225,000,000 in bank financing (the "Bank Financing") to fund a
portion of the Closing Cash Consideration. In the event that Parent is not
able to consummate the Bank Financing, Parent intends to undertake a placement
of convertible notes in a comparable amount (the "Convertible Note Financing"
and, together with the Bank Financing, the "Financing"). The Bank Financing
Commitments have not been amended or modified prior to the date hereof (and,
as of the date hereof, no such amendment or modification is contemplated or
pending), and the commitments contained in the Bank Financing Commitments have
not been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. There are no side
letters or other contracts or arrangements related to the funding or
investing, as applicable, of the full amount of the Bank Financing other than
as expressly set forth in the Bank Financing Commitments furnished to the
Company pursuant to this Section 4.4. As of the date hereof, Parent has not
received any written notice of default or event that with notice or lapse of
time, or both, would constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent or
any of its Affiliates or, to the knowledge of Parent, any other Person, in
each case under the Bank Financing Commitments.



The Bank Financing Commitments are not subject to any conditions or other
contingencies (including pursuant to any "flex" provisions in the related fee
letter or otherwise) other than as expressly set forth therein and, as of the
date hereof, are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding
and enforceable obligations of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each of
the other parties thereto. All commitments and other fees required to be paid
under the Bank Financing Commitments prior to the date hereof have been paid
in full, and Parent is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date
hereof that would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions or
statements set forth in the Bank Financing Commitments inaccurate or that
would reasonably be expected to cause the Bank Financing Commitments to be
ineffective. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Bank Financing
Commitments and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions contained in
Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, the aggregate proceeds contemplated by the Bank
Financing Commitments, together with other financial resources of Parent and
Merger Sub, including cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries on the Closing
Date, will be sufficient for Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger
upon the terms contemplated by this Agreement and pay all related fees and
expenses. Assuming the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 are
satisfied at Closing, Parent is not aware of any fact or occurrence existing
on the date hereof that would or would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the Bank Financing not to be satisfied or the full amount of
the Bank Financing not to be available in full to Parent at the Closing Date.

Section 4.5 Brokers. Except for Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated, the fees of which will be paid by Parent, no broker, finder or
investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finder's or other fee or
commission in connection with the Transactions based upon arrangements made by
or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub.

Section 4.6 SEC Reports; Financial Statements.

heretofore made available to the Company, in the form filed with or furnished

SEC by Parent since January 1, 2012 (all such documents, together with all
exhibits and schedules to the foregoing materials and all information
incorporated therein by reference, the "Parent SEC Documents"). As of their
respective filing dates (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the
date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing), the Parent SEC
Documents complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the
case may be, including, in each case, the rules and regulations promulgated

consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries as of the dates
thereof and their respective consolidated results of operations and cash flows
for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to
normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments that were not, or are not
expected to be, material in amount), all in accordance with GAAP and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Since January 1,
2012, Parent has not made any change in the accounting practices or policies
applied in the preparation of its financial statements, except as required by
GAAP, SEC rule or policy, or applicable Law.

listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the NYSE.

amendment or supplement thereto and at the time it (or any post-effective
amendment or supplement) becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Parent nor Merger Sub makes
any representation or warranty with respect to statements included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement based on information
supplied by or on behalf of the Company specifically for inclusion or
incorporation by reference therein.

Section 4.8 No Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Documents filed prior to the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its

Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any material property or asset of Parent

reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect; (b) there is

Agreement, if made on or immediately following the date of such event, untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect as of the Closing Date (provided, that
the failure to so notify Parent shall not, in itself, give rise to a separate
basis following the Closing for a Parent Indemnified Party to seek
indemnification for such failure to give notice pursuant to Section 8.2(b)),
(b) the occurrence of any change, condition or event that has had or is
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (c) any material
failure of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Affiliate of
the Company to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it hereunder or any event or condition that, alone or in
combination with any others, would otherwise reasonably be expected to result
in the nonfulfillment of any of the conditions to Parent's and Merger Sub's
obligations set forth in Section 7.3, (d) any notice or other communication
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the consummation of the Transactions or (e) any Action
pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened against the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any Holder relating to the Transactions or otherwise;
provided, however, that no such notice shall be deemed to cure any breach of
any representation or warranty made in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement to which the Company is a party or have any effect for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.3, the
compliance by the Company with any covenant set forth herein or the
indemnification provided for in Section 8.2.

Section 5.5 Takeover Statutes. If any state takeover statute or similar Law
shall become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company
and its Board of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby or thereby and
otherwise act to eliminate the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.6 Equity-Based Plans. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that after the Effective Time, neither

respect of, any membership interest of the Company, the Surviving Company or
any of their Subsidiaries; provided, that such actions may be expressly
conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

its Representatives to hold, in confidence all documents and information
furnished to it by or on behalf of any other party to this Agreement in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the terms of
the confidentiality agreement dated April 25, 2014 between Parent and the
Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing Date. If for any reason this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms. In
the event a party is required, as advised by such party's outside legal
counsel, to disclose such information by Law or by deposition, interrogatory,
requests for information or documents by a governmental entity, subpoena or
similar process, such party shall first promptly notify the other parties
hereto in writing of the existence, terms and circumstances surrounding such
request, shall cooperate (at the expense of the other parties' hereto) with
the other parties hereto in connection with their seeking any protective order
or other appropriate remedy, and, if and to the extent, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver by the other parties hereto of
this provision, such party is legally required, as advised by its outside
legal counsel, to disclose any such information or else suffer exposure to
censure or civil or criminal fine or penalty, shall disclose only that portion
of such information that such counsel advises is legally required to be
disclosed and shall use reasonable efforts (at the expense of the other
parties hereto) to obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will
be accorded to any such information so required to be disclosed).

Section 5.8 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances.

(a) Each of the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all action to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable, including to (i) obtain from Governmental Authorities all
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders as are
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
promptly make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions, with respect to this Agreement and the Original Filing required
under the HSR Act or any other applicable Law, (iii) have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any order, decree, ruling, judgment, injunction or
other action (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect
and that enjoins, restrains, conditions, makes illegal or otherwise restricts
or prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(iv) cause any Holder that, immediately after the Effective Time, will (itself
or together with its Affiliates) beneficially own more than 5% of the issued
and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock, to file standard passivity and
anti-association commitments with the Federal Reserve Board. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Company shall permit Parent
reasonably to participate in the defense and settlement of any claim, suit or
cause of action relating to this Agreement, the Merger or the



other transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company shall not settle or
compromise any such claim, suit or cause of action without Parent's written
consent.

(b) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, give promptly such
notice to third parties and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such
third party consents and estoppel certificates as set forth on Schedule
5.8(b). Parent shall cooperate with and assist the Company in giving such
notices and obtaining such consents and estoppel certificates; provided,
however, that Parent shall have no obligation to give any guarantee or other
consideration of any nature in connection with any such notice, consent or
estoppel certificate or consent to any change in the terms of any agreement or
arrangement that Parent in its sole discretion may deem adverse to the
interests of Parent or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; provided,
further, that the Company shall not be required to pay any consideration to
any such third party in connection with any such notice, consent or estoppel
certificate.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be
required by this Section 5.8 to take or agree to undertake any action,
including entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or other
arrangement, that would (i) require the divestiture of any assets of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, (ii) limit Parent's freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to consolidate and control, the
Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their assets or businesses or any of
Parent's or its Affiliates' other assets or businesses or (iii) otherwise
impose an Undue Burden.

Section 5.9 Financing Arrangements.

(a) Parent shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and consummate
the Bank Financing described in the Bank Financing Commitments on the terms
and conditions described in the Bank Financing Commitments (including the
exercise of so-called "flex" provisions in the related fee letter) as promptly
as practicable (taking into account the timing of the Marketing Period and the
Closing). Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of any material developments concerning the status of the
Bank Financing. Parent shall provide the Company, upon reasonable request,
with copies of any Bank Financing agreements and such other information and
documentation regarding the Bank Financing as shall be reasonably necessary to
allow the Company to monitor the progress of such financing activities.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto: (i) agrees that it will not bring or support any
Person, or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support any Person, in any
action, suit, proceeding, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Person that has committed or
subsequently commits to provide or otherwise enters into agreements in
connection with providing the Bank Financing to Parent or any of its
Affiliates (the "Bank Financing Sources," which defined term for the purposes
of this provision shall include Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner and Smith Incorporated, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and their respective former, current and future
Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, controlling persons, officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives involved in the
Bank Financing) in any way relating to this



Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Bank Financing Commitments or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New
York State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New
York; (ii) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Bank Financing
Commitments, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Bank Financing Sources in
any way relating to the Bank Financing Commitments or the performance thereof
or the financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the extent
such principles or rules would require or permit the application of laws of
another jurisdiction; and (iii) hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives
any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any litigation
(whether at law or in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) directly or
indirectly arising out of or relating in any way to the Bank Financing
Commitments or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (A) the
Company and the Holder Representative (on behalf of itself and the Holders)
and their respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees,
agents, partners, managers, members or stockholders shall not have any rights
or claims against any Bank Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Bank Financing Commitments or the performance
thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or in equity,
in contract, in tort or otherwise and (B) no Bank Financing Source shall have
any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise) to the Company, the
Holder Representative, any equityholders of the Company and their respective
Subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Bank Financing Commitments or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Bank Financing Sources are intended third-party beneficiaries
of, and shall be entitled to the protections of this provision to the same
extent as if the Bank Financing Sources were parties to this Agreement. This
Section 5.9(b) may not be amended, modified or supplemented, or any of its
provisions waived, without the written consent of the Bank Financing Sources,
which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion of the Bank
Financing Sources.

(c) For clarification, the Financing is not a condition to Closing.

(d) By September 24, 2014, Parent will execute and deliver to the Company
documentation providing for an interim line of credit for the Company or its
Subsidiary to borrow from Parent or another financing source $15,000,000 on
the terms of the draft documentation dated as of August 21, 2014 for the
proposed Amegy facility furnished to Parent, with only such changes as are
required to effectuate the substitution of Parent as the lender thereunder,
and such other changes as may be mutually agreed by the parties (the "Interim
Line



of Credit"). If Parent does not execute and deliver, or cause another
financing source to execute and deliver, to the Company the documentation
governing the Interim Line of Credit by September 24, 2014, the Company may
secure financing from Amegy or another financing source on terms (including
the collateral package) substantially similar to those contemplated by the
above-referenced draft documentation so long as such financing can be repaid
in full at the Closing by the ongoing line of credit described below. Parent
acknowledges that the Interim Line of Credit and funding thereunder is
critical to the Company's and its Subsidiary's ability to operate in the
ordinary course and that the Company would have entered into arrangements with
Amegy to provide such financing in the absence of Parent's covenant to provide
same under this Section 5.9(d). Parent's breach of its obligation to provide
the Interim Line of Credit and funding on the terms thereof would cause the
condition in Section 7.2(a)(ii) not to be satisfied. At the Closing, Parent
will execute and deliver to the Surviving Company documentation that
refinances the Interim Line of Credit and allows for borrowings from Parent or
another financing source equal to $75,000,000 on the terms of the draft
documentation dated as of August 21, 2014 furnished to Parent, provided,
however that the Surviving Company shall not be permitted to borrow in excess
of $15,000,000 thereunder prior to January 2, 2015. If the Closing occurs,
Parent will be required to provide the financing described herein through the
end of the 2017 Earnout Period.

Section 5.10 Financing Cooperation.

(a) Prior to the earlier of (i) the Closing and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause
their respective Representatives to, provide to Parent such cooperation
reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the Financing, including:

customary one-on-one meetings or conference calls with the parties acting as
lead arrangers, underwriters, initial purchasers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Financing and senior management and
representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company),
presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, road shows and
sessions with prospective lenders, investors and rating agencies;

(ii) providing customary and reasonable assistance with the preparation of
materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents, private

delivery of customary representation letters in connection with prior audits
of the Company, auditors comfort letter, and bank information memoranda;

(iii) furnishing Parent and its Financing Sources with customary financial and
other information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (including in connection with Parent's preparation of pro forma
financial statements), including, without limitation, unaudited interim
financial statements, financial data, projections, audit reports and other
information of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under
the Securities Act for a registered public offering, and of type and form
customarily



included in private placements under Rule 144A under the Securities Act, to
consummate the offerings contemplated by the Financing, or as otherwise
reasonably required in connection with the Financing, or as otherwise
necessary in order to assist in receiving customary "comfort" (including
"negative assurance" comfort) from independent accountants in connection with
the offerings contemplated by the Financing, and reasonable and customary
authorization letters to the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of
information to prospective lenders and investors and containing customary
information (all such information in this clause (iii), the "Required
Information");

(iv) providing customary information relating to the Company that is
reasonably available to it to assist Parent in the preparation of, and
executing and delivering, any credit agreement, indentures, underwriting
agreements, purchase agreements, currency or interest hedging arrangements,
other definitive financing documents, officer's certificates, customary
closing documents, or other certificates or documents with respect to the
Financing contemplated by the Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Parent (including customary consents of accountants for use of their reports
in any materials relating to the Financing); provided that, in no event shall
any such credit agreement, indenture, underwriting agreement, purchase
agreement, currency or interest hedging arrangement, other definitive
financing document, officer's certificate, customary closing document, or
other certificate or document with respect to the Financing contemplated by
the Financing (to the extent binding on the Company) have any force or effect
prior to the Closing;

(v) furnishing Parent and its Financing Sources as promptly as practicable
with (i) audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 and (ii) unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for each
fiscal quarter ending after June 30, 2014 at least 50 days before the Closing
Date; and

(vi) taking all corporate actions, contingent upon the occurrence of the
Closing, reasonably requested by Parent that are necessary or customary to
permit the consummation of the Financing, it being agreed that the Company's
directors, managers or similar governing individuals or bodies shall not be
required to adopt resolutions approving any portion of the Financing.

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.10 or in any provision of
this Agreement, in no event shall the Company be required to deliver any
audited financial statements beyond those included in the Financial
Statements.

(b) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to update Required
Information provided to Parent pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) of Section
5.10(a) as may be necessary such that the Required Information does not
contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements contained therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 5.10 or in any
provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required (i) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or (ii)
except as agreed by Parent in its sole



discretion as specified in Section 1.2, to consummate the Closing any earlier
than two Business Days after the final day of the Marketing Period.

(d) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective partners,
members, directors, managers, officers, employees, accountants, legal counsel
and other Representatives shall be required to take any action that would
require such Person to waive or amend any terms of this Agreement, require
such Person to pay any commitment or other similar fee for which it has not
received prior reimbursement by or on behalf of Parent or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Financing or its performance of its
respective obligations under this Section 5.10 and any information utilized in
connection therewith (except to the extent arising out of or relating to
information provided to Parent by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this
Section 5.10), or would cause the Company or any of its Affiliates to breach
this Agreement or become unable to satisfy a condition to the Closing;
provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, such accountants and legal
counsel may be subject to potential liability in connection with comfort
letters, audit opinions and legal opinions provided in connection therewith.
Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective partners, members, directors, managers,
officers, employees, accountants, legal counsel and other Representatives from
and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in
connection with the Financing and the performance of their respective
obligations under this Section 5.10 and any information utilized in connection
therewith, in each case other than (i) to the extent arising out of or
relating to information provided to Parent by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to this Section 5.10, (ii) such as arises from comfort letters, audit
opinions and legal opinions provided by accountants or legal counsel in
connection therewith and (iii) out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other Representatives
incurred by the Company and its Affiliates in connection with the cooperation
required by this Section 5.10 (such costs and expenses referred to in this
clause (ii), the "Section 5.10 Expenses"). If the Closing does not occur,
Parent shall, promptly upon request of the Company at any time after the
termination of this Agreement for any reason (which request shall be
accompanied by documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent that such
expenses were incurred solely in connection with the cooperation required by
this Section 5.10), reimburse the Company and its Subsidiaries for all
reasonable Section 5.10 Expenses incurred through the date of such
termination. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto acknowledge and
agree that the provisions contained in this Section 5.10 represent the sole
obligation of the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective partners,
members, directors, managers, officers, employees, accountants, legal counsel
and other Representatives with respect to cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing.

Section 5.11 Public Announcements. Each of the parties shall consult with one
another before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statement with respect to the
Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement prior to such consultation, except that no such approval
shall be necessary to the extent disclosure is required by applicable Law or
any listing agreement of Parent.

Section 5.12 Registration and Listing of Shares of Parent Common Stock.



(a) At the Closing, Parent shall enter into the Registration Rights Agreement
pursuant to which, subject in each case to the terms and provisions thereof,
Parent shall take such steps as set forth therein to (i) prepare and file with
the SEC a resale shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the "Registration
Statement") for the benefit of the Holders covering all of the shares of
Parent Common Stock delivered to them pursuant to this Agreement (the

declared effective under the Securities Act on or before the date (the

shares of the Registrable Securities on or before the Registration Deadline
Date, (iv) keep such Registration Statement effective for a period ending on
the earlier of (x) the date following the second anniversary of the Closing
Date on which there shall remain fewer than 1,840,001 Registrable Securities
and (y) the 30 month anniversary of the Closing Date, and (v) prepare and file
with the SEC such amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement as
may be necessary to comply with the Securities Act in order to enable the
disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement. In case of any inconsistency between this Section 5.12 and the
Registration Rights Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement shall
control.

(b) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved for listing on the
NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

Section 5.13 Rule 144 Information. With a view to making available to the
Holders the benefits of Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the SEC
that may at any time permit a Holder to sell Registrable Securities to the
public without registration or pursuant to the Registration Statement, Parent
shall, until the second anniversary of the Closing Date:

(a) make and keep available adequate current public information, as those
terms are understood and defined in Rule 144;

(b) use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC in a timely
manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act (if Parent is subject to such reporting
requirements); and

(c) furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any Registrable
Securities, forthwith upon request (A) to the extent accurate, a written
statement by Parent that it has complied with the reporting requirements of
Rule 144, the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act (if Parent is subject to
such reporting requirements); and (B) such other information as may be
reasonably requested in availing any Holder of any rule or regulation of the
SEC that permits the selling of any such securities without registration (if
Parent is subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act).

Section 5.14 Tax Certificate. At Closing, the Company shall provide a
statement to Parent described in Treasury Regulation 1.1445-11T(d)(2)(i),
dated as of the Closing Date and signed on behalf of all Holders by the Holder
Representative, in form and substance required under the Treasury Regulations
issued pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code, informing Parent that withholding
is not required under Section 1445 of the Code.



Section 5.15 Access to Information after the Closing; Preservation of Records.
From and after the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Company shall afford the
Holder Representative, the Holders and their respective advisors reasonable
access, during normal business hours in accordance with all applicable Laws,
to the books and records of the Company and the Surviving Company (and shall
permit such Persons to examine and copy such books and records to the extent
reasonably requested by such party) and shall cause their advisors to furnish
all information reasonably requested by the Holder Representative, the Holders
or their respective advisors in connection with financial reporting and Tax
matters (including financial and Tax audits and Tax contests) or third party
litigation, in each case as it pertains to the Company and its Subsidiaries as

a period of seven years following the Closing, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries to, maintain all such books and
records and shall not destroy or dispose of any such books and records.
Thereafter, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries, to maintain all such books and records in accordance with its
records retention policy.

Section 5.16 Indemnification of Officers and Directors of the Company.

(a) In addition to the obligations set forth in Sections 5.16(b) through

prior to such date, in which case, such period shall be extended until such
claim is fully resolved), the Surviving Company shall fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and any of its Subsidiaries pursuant
to any indemnification or advancement provisions pursuant to, or under, (i)
the organizational documents of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (ii) any
Material Contract set forth in Section 3.17(a) of the Disclosure Schedules or

Subsidiaries, together with each such Person's estate, heirs, successors,
assigns and personal representatives, being referred to collectively as the
"Covered Persons"); provided, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving
Company be obligated to indemnify any person for any amounts payable by such
Person pursuant to Article VIII hereof or as a result of any of the matters
described in Section 8.2. The organizational documents of the Surviving
Company shall contain the provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement or exculpation from liability set forth in the Company LLC
Agreement on the date of this Agreement which provisions (together with the
comparable provisions in the organizational documents of the Company's
Subsidiaries) shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of any Indemnified Party except as may be required by applicable Law.



(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall be permitted to purchase a six
year "tail" directors and officers liability insurance policy with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Closing (the "DandO Tail"); provided, that the
Company shall pay the full purchase price for such DandO Tail prior to the
Closing. Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Company not to, take,
or omit to take, any action the result of which would be reasonably likely to
result in the DandO Tail being terminated, void or otherwise inapplicable.

(c) If the Surviving Company, or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Company, as the case may be, honor the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.16.

(d) This Section 5.16 shall survive the Closing and the Effective Time for a
period of six years (unless notice of an actual or threatened claim is given
to the Surviving Company prior to such date, in which case, such period shall
be extended until such claim is fully resolved), is intended to benefit and
may be enforced by the Covered Persons and shall be binding on all successors
and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Company.

Section 5.17 Termination of Certain Agreements. Prior to or at the Closing,
the Company shall terminate or cause to be terminated, pursuant to termination
agreements in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, each
Contract between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
any Related Party of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other
hand, other than the Contracts set forth on Schedule 5.17 (such Contracts to
be so terminated, the "Terminated Related Party Contracts").

Section 5.18 No Vote of Parent Stockholders. Parent shall not repurchase
Parent Common Stock or take any other action that would result in the vote of
the stockholders of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the holders of any
other securities of Parent or any of its Affiliates (equity or otherwise) to
be required by any applicable Law, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
of Parent or any of its Affiliates or the applicable rules of any stock
exchange on which securities of Parent or any of its Affiliates are traded in
order for Parent or any of its Affiliates to approve the Merger or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.19 Distribution of RAL Assets. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause all RALs held by the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
contributed to a trust or other form of legal entity and shall cause all of

ARTICLE VI 
TAX MATTERS

Section 6.1 Tax Treatment.

(a) The parties hereto agree that (i) the purchase and sale of the Units is
intended to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as if (A) the
Holders sold the Units to Parent and (B) Parent acquired each of the assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, each in accordance with Situation 2 of IRS
Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-6 I.R.B. 6; and (ii) absent a change in applicable
Law or the conclusion of an audit to the contrary, any shares of Parent Common
Stock or cash held in the Escrow Fund shall not be treated as issued or paid
to the Holders until the Holders' rights to such Parent Common Stock become
fixed.

(b) The Merger Consideration (and any liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries treated as purchase price for federal income Tax purposes) will
be determined and allocated among the assets of the Company in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Allocation"). Parent shall submit a draft of the Allocation to the Holder
Representative within a reasonable period following the Closing Date for the
Holder Representative's review and approval. Parent and the Holder
Representative shall negotiate in good faith regarding any such draft, any
comments or proposed revisions to any such draft and any disagreements with
respect thereto for a period of time not to exceed 30 days following delivery
of any such draft. If the Holder Representative and Parent agree on the final
Allocation within such period, the parties agree that all Tax Returns
(including IRS Form 8594) will be prepared in a manner consistent with (and
the parties will not otherwise take a position for income Tax purposes that is
inconsistent with) the Allocation (taking into account any amounts treated as
adjustments to the purchase price for Tax purposes) as finally agreed unless
required by an applicable Tax Authority. If the parties fail to agree on the
Allocation within such time frame, each party shall be free to make its own
determination of the amount and allocation of the Merger Consideration among
the Company's and Subsidiaries' assets, and no such determination shall be
binding on the other party.

Section 6.2 Certain Tax Returns.

(a) The Holder Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared the IRS
Form 1065 (and comparable state income Tax Returns) of the Company with
respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods ("Flow-Through Returns"). All such Flow-
Through Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice,
except as otherwise required by applicable Law and shall not reflect the
deemed sale of assets to Parent described in Section 6.1. No later than 90
days prior to the due date (determined with regard to all available automatic
extensions) for filing such Flow-Through Returns, the Holder Representative
shall deliver such Flow-Through Returns, along with supporting workpapers, to
Parent for its review, and the Holder Representative shall consider in good
faith any reasonable comments from Parent made within 60 days prior to the due
date for filing such Flow-Through Returns (determined with regard to all
available automatic extensions). The Holder Representative shall cause such
Flow-Through Return to be filed.



(b) Each Tax Return of the Company or its Subsidiaries other than those
described in Section 6.2(a) shall be prepared and filed by the party required
to file such Tax Return under applicable Law (without affecting the liability
for any underlying Tax as set forth in this Agreement).

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, any deductible item resulting from or
attributable to (i) transaction bonuses, change-in-control payments, severance
payments, retention payments, or similar payments made to employees or other
service providers of the Company; (ii) the fees, expenses, and interest
(including unamortized original issue discount and any other amounts treated
as interest for federal income Tax purposes and any prepayment penalty or
breakage fees or accelerated deferred financing fees) incurred by the Company
with respect to the payment of any Indebtedness; (iii) the amount of
investment banking, legal, and accounting fees and expenses paid or payable by
the Company; and (iv) the amount of any deductions for federal income Tax
purposes as a result of the exercise or payment for cancellation of employee
or other compensatory warrants or similar interests, in each case arising in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and as
determined jointly by Parent and the Holder Representative in good faith (with
respect to the amount of such items and not with respect to the deductibility
which shall be determined solely by Holder Representative), shall be taken
into account as a deduction in the Flow-Through Returns of the Holders (and
treated as a liability assumed by Parent, and therefore as additional purchase
price, to the extent paid by Parent or its Affiliates and not otherwise
treated for applicable income tax purposes as part of the purchase price) to
the extent permitted under applicable Law, as determined jointly by Parent and
the Holder Representative in good faith. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
and the Surviving Company shall in no event be liable to any Person (including
any Holder) if any such treatment is challenged or disallowed for any reason.

Section 6.3 Transfer Taxes. Transfer Taxes payable by reason of the Merger, if
any, will be borne 50% by Parent and 50% by the Holders. Parent and the Holder
Representative agree to cooperate in the execution and delivery of all
instruments and certificates necessary to minimize the amount of any Transfer
Taxes and to enable Parent and the Holders to comply with any filing
requirements related to Transfer Taxes.

Section 6.4 Tax Refunds. Any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are refunded to the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries within three years following the Closing Date,
other than refunds (a) of Taxes that are income Taxes (including franchise
Taxes based on income), (b) attributable to an event occurring after the
Closing Date, (c) of Taxes that are paid by Parent, the Surviving Company or
its Subsidiaries after the Closing that are not indemnified under Article
VIII, (d) taken into account as an asset in arriving at Closing Net Working
Capital or (e) reflected on the Financial Statements or the Balance Sheet, in
each case net of any Taxes and other costs incurred or to be incurred in
respect of the receipt or accrual of such refunds, shall promptly be paid over
to the Holder Representative for subsequent distribution to the Holders.

ARTICLE VIII 
INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1 Survival.

(a) The representations and warranties of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement and any certificate delivered pursuant hereto
shall survive the Closing until the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date
and shall thereupon terminate and be of no further force and effect; provided,
however, that:

(i) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.1 (Organization
and Qualification), Section 3.2 (Authority), Section 3.4 (Capitalization),
Section 3.5 (Equity Interests), and Section 3.26 (Brokers) shall survive
indefinitely;

(ii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.15 (Taxes)
(such representations and warranties, together with the representations and
warranties referred to in clause (i) above, collectively, the "Company
Fundamental Representations") shall survive the Closing for 60 days following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations and shall thereupon
terminate and be of no further force and effect; and

(iii) the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1
(Organization and Qualification), Section 4.2 (Authority), Section 4.5
(Brokers) and Section 4.13 (Issued Shares) (collectively, the "Parent
Fundamental Representations" and, together with the Company Fundamental
Representations, the "Fundamental Representations") shall survive
indefinitely.



(b) All covenants requiring performance prior to the Closing Date contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing for a period of 12 months from the
Closing; provided, that the covenants in this Agreement relating to Taxes
shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations following the date all performance thereunder was due to be
performed. The covenants in this Agreement requiring performance after the
Closing (including the indemnification obligations in this Article VIII) shall
survive the Closing without any time limitation, unless a time limitation is
otherwise expressly provided therein.

(c) Except as provided in Section 8.7(e), the indemnification obligations of
the Holders pursuant to Section 8.2(g) shall terminate on the date that is the
three year anniversary of the Closing Date regardless of whether a claim is
then outstanding.

(d) None of the Holders, Parent or Merger Sub shall have any liability with
respect to any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements unless
notice of an actual or threatened claim, or of discovery of any facts or
circumstances that Parent or the Holder Representative, as the case may be,
reasonably believes may result in a claim hereunder is given to the other
party prior to the expiration of the survival period, if any, for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, in which case such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive as to such claim
until such claim has been finally resolved, without the requirement of
commencing any Action in order to extend such survival period or preserve such
claim.

Section 8.2 Indemnification by the Holders. From and after the Closing,
subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement including Section 8.1
and Section 8.5, the Holders, severally in accordance with their respective
Pro Rata Percentages but not jointly, shall save, defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company and their Affiliates, and
the respective Representatives, successors and assigns of each of the
foregoing (collectively, the "Parent Indemnified Parties") from and against,
and shall compensate and reimburse each of foregoing for, the following,
including any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims,
interest, awards, judgments, Taxes, penalties, costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing) (hereinafter
collectively, "Losses"), asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered by
any of the foregoing as a result of, arising out of or relating to the
following:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company contained
in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.3(a) (without giving effect to materiality or Company Material
Adverse Effect qualifiers set forth in the Company Materiality Representations
or subsequent notifications thereto pursuant to Section 5.4);

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Company or its
Subsidiaries, to be performed by the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing, or by the Holders prior to or following the Closing, as applicable,
contained in this Agreement (including as a result of the action or failure to
act of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Holders, as applicable);



(c) any Transaction Expenses charged to Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Company, the Company or any of their Affiliates that remain unpaid after the
Closing and are not reflected in the Final Net Working Capital;

(d) any Pre-Closing Taxes;

(e) any inaccuracy or omission with respect to the Holder Information
contained in the Consideration Spreadsheet or any claim, demand or allegation
by any Holder or purported owner of Units or other equity securities of the
Company or any right to acquire Units or other equity securities of the
Company that such Person is entitled to receive any consideration in
connection with the Merger that is different from or in addition to the
consideration payable to such Person, if any, as provided for under this
Agreement;

(f) any Losses suffered by the Company, the Surviving Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent or any of its Affiliates arising from actions by, or
the operations of, Advent, Novation or any of their Affiliates prior to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Advent Agreement; and

(g) any of the matters set forth on Schedule 8.2(g) subject to the terms
hereof and thereof.

Section 8.3 Indemnification by Parent. From and after the Closing, Parent
shall save, defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Holders and their
Affiliates and the respective Representatives, successors and assigns of each
of the foregoing (collectively, the "Holder Indemnified Parties") from and
against, and shall compensate and reimburse each of the foregoing for, any and
all Losses asserted against, incurred, sustained or suffered by any of the
foregoing as a result of, arising out of or relating to:

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub
contained in this Agreement or in the certificate delivered by Parent and
Merger Sub pursuant to Section 7.2(a) (without giving effect to any
materiality or Parent Material Adverse Effect qualifiers therein); and

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by Parent or Merger Sub contained
in this Agreement.

Section 8.4 Procedures.

(a) A party seeking indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") in respect of,
arising out of or involving a Loss, claim, demand or Action made or commenced
by any person against the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim") shall
deliver written notice (a "Claim Notice") in respect thereof to the Holder
Representative, on behalf of the Holders, or to Parent, as applicable (the
"Indemnifying Party"), with reasonable promptness after receipt by such
Indemnified Party of written notice of the Third Party Claim, and shall
provide the Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as
the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to deliver a Claim
Notice, or any delay in providing such written notice, however, shall not
release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this Article



VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced
by such failure or such Claim Notice is not delivered on or prior to the
expiration of the applicable survival period.

(b) If the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to
indemnify the Indemnified Party against any and all Losses that may result
from a Third Party Claim that is exclusively for civil monetary damages at law
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (and, at Parent's request,
demonstrates the wherewithal of the Indemnifying Party to satisfy any such
reasonably expected potential Losses, which may be by recourse to the Escrow
Fund), the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 15 days of receipt of a Claim Notice from the
Indemnified Party in respect of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
thereof at the expense of the Indemnifying Party (which expenses shall not be
applied against any indemnity limitation herein) with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim for equitable or injunctive relief, any claim
that would impose criminal liability or damages, or any Third Party Claim that
relates to Taxes other than solely Pre-Closing Taxes, and the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to defend, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party
(to the extent Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim are indemnifiable
under Section 8.2), any such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified
Party for any period during which the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume
the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not expressly elect to
assume the defense of such Third Party Claim within the time period and
otherwise in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 8.4(b), the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably consult with the
Indemnifying Party prior to the settlement of any such Third Party Claim and
discuss with the Indemnifying Party in good faith any input regarding the
claim and potential settlement the Indemnifying Party may have prior to any
settlement (in each case, to the extent the terms thereof are not subject to a
confidentiality agreement with the claimant). After such consultation (or in
the event that the Indemnified Party is prohibited from consulting or the
Indemnifying Party elects not to consult with the Indemnified Party), subject
to Schedule 8.2(g), the Indemnified Party shall have the right to settle any
such claim, even if the terms thereof are inconsistent with those proposed or
advocated by the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that, except with the
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, no settlement of any such
claim or consent to entry of any judgment with respect to such Third-Party
Claim shall alone be determinative of the validity or amount of the Third-
Party Claim as an indemnifiable claim. If the Indemnifying Party consents to
the general economic terms of such settlement, the settlement of any such
Third Party Claim shall be determinative of the amount of any claim for Losses
and neither the Holder Representative nor any Holder shall have any power or
authority to object under any provision of this Article VIII to the settlement
or the amount of any claim for Losses by Parent against the Escrow Fund or
otherwise with respect to such settlement to the extent the amount of Losses
claimed are consistent with the terms of such settlement. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the employment of such counsel
shall have been specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party,
(ii) the named parties to the Third Party Claim (including any impleaded
parties) include both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and
the Indemnified Party shall have been



advised by such counsel that there are one or more legal defenses available to
it that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party is not defending such
Third Party Claim diligently in good faith. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall, at the
Indemnifying Party's expense, cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in the Indemnified Party's possession or
under the Indemnified Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably
required by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such
Third Party Claim if such settlement, compromise or judgment (A) involves a
finding or admission of wrongdoing, (B) does not include an unconditional
written release by the claimant or plaintiff of the Indemnified Party from all
liability in respect of such Third Party Claim without the requirement of any
compensation or payment by the Indemnified Party, (C) imposes equitable
remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than solely the
payment of money damages for which the Indemnified Party will be indemnified
hereunder, or (D) would result in any increase in Taxes of Parent, the
Surviving Company or any of their Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

(c) An Indemnified Party seeking indemnification in respect of, arising out of
or involving a Loss or a claim or demand hereunder that does not involve a
Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party (a "Direct Claim") shall deliver a Claim Notice in respect
thereof to the Indemnifying Party with reasonable promptness after becoming
aware of facts supporting such Direct Claim, and shall provide the
Indemnifying Party with such information with respect thereto as the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to deliver a Claim
Notice, however, shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article VIII except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party is materially prejudiced by such failure and shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any other obligation or liability that it may have to
the Indemnified Party or otherwise than pursuant to this Article VIII. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within 30 days
following its receipt of a Claim Notice in respect of a Direct Claim that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder,
such Direct Claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such Claim Notice
shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party hereunder
and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such liability to the
Indemnified Party on demand. If the Indemnifying Party agrees that it has an
indemnification obligation but asserts that it is obligated to pay a lesser
amount than that claimed by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall pay such lesser amount promptly to the Indemnified Party, without
prejudice to or waiver of the Indemnified Party's claim for the difference.

(d) The indemnification required hereunder shall be made by prompt payment by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement (to the extent of any
amounts then held in the Escrow Fund, if applicable) or by the Indemnifying
Party (to the extent of any amounts not then held in the Escrow Fund, if
applicable) of the amount of actual Losses incurred in connection therewith,
together with interest on any amount not paid as necessary to the Indemnified
Party by the Escrow Agent or the Indemnifying Party, as applicable, within
five Business Days after receipt of written notice of such Losses, from the
date such Losses have



been notified to the Indemnifying Party. Amounts to be paid under this Article
VIII shall bear interest at a rate equal to the rate of interest from time to
time announced publicly by The Wall Street Journal as its prime rate,
calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the number of days elapsed.

(e) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to require that any action be
made or brought against any other Person before action is brought or claim is
made against it hereunder by the Indemnified Party.

(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.10, each Indemnifying Party
hereby consents to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any court in which an
Action in respect of a Third Party Claim is brought against any Indemnified
Party for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Party may have under this
Agreement with respect to such Action or the matters alleged therein and
agrees that process may be served on each Indemnifying Party with respect to
such claim anywhere.

Section 8.5 Limits on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement:

(a) the Holders shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant
to Section 8.2(a) (it being understood that this Section 8.5(a) shall not
affect the Holders' liability for a claim for indemnification asserted under a
provision other than Section 8.2(a)) unless and until the aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses which may be recovered from the Holders equals or exceeds
$2,000,000 (the "Parent Basket"), in which case the Holders shall be liable
for the full amount of such Losses from the first dollar thereof; provided,
that all Losses resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims arising
out of the same facts, events or circumstances which total less than $5,000
shall be excluded in calculating the Parent Basket and no Parent Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to recover, and shall have no recourse against any
Holder or the Escrow Fund, for any such Losses;

(b) Parent shall not be liable for any claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.3(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses
which may be recovered from Parent equals or exceeds $2,000,000, in which case
Parent shall be liable for the full amount of such Losses from the first
dollar thereof;

(c) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from the Holders arising solely out of or relating to the causes set
forth in Section 8.2(a) shall be an amount equal to the Escrow Fund, which
shall also be the sole source of recovery with respect to such Losses;

(d) the maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which may be
recovered from Parent arising out of or relating to the causes set forth in
Section 8.3(a) shall be an amount equal to $20,000,000;

(e) the Holders shall not be obligated to indemnify Parent or any other Person
with respect to any Loss to the extent that a specific accrual or reserve for
the amount of such Loss was reflected on the Balance Sheet as a liability in
calculating the Closing Net Working Capital;



(f) the liability of each Holder with respect to any Losses hereunder shall be
limited to such Holder's Pro Rata Percentage of such Losses;

(g) the sole sources of recovery for any Losses pursuant to Section 8.2(g)
will first be satisfied by the balance then remaining in the Escrow Fund that
exceeds a reasonable reserve for any claims then pending hereunder and then as
a set-off against any unpaid portion of the Earnout Consideration pursuant to
Section 8.7(b);

(h) in no event shall an Indemnifying Party have any liability to an
Indemnified Party for any punitive or special damages other than punitive or
special damages recovered by third parties in connection with a Third Party
Claim. For the sake of clarity, the parties understand that Taxes incurred by
Parent or its Affiliates by reason of the inability to treat the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as described in Section 6.1(a) due to a breach
or inaccuracy of the representations in Section 3.15(g) are not punitive or
special damages.

(i) Other than with respect to a breach of Section 3.15(d), (g) or (h), any
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement for Losses in respect of breaches
of the representations in Section 3.15 shall be limited to Pre-Closing Taxes
and Losses arising therefrom.

(j) For the avoidance of doubt, a claim arising out of the same set of facts
or circumstances for indemnification may be brought under one or more
provisions of Section 8.2 (without duplication of recovery) and,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the limitations on indemnity
set forth in this Section 8.5 and in Section 8.1 that apply to a particular
subsection of Section 8.2 will apply only to such subsection and any other
subsection to which the limitations in this Section 8.5 or in Section 8.1
expressly apply. Accordingly, while duplication of recoveries are not intended
or permitted, a claim brought under one subsection of Section 8.2 may result
in a more favorable recovery than under another subsection of Section 8.2.

The foregoing clauses (a), (b), (c) and (d) shall not apply to Losses arising
out of or relating to the inaccuracy or breach of any Company Fundamental
Representation or Parent Fundamental Representation, or to any claims pursuant
to Section 8.2(d). The maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses which
may be recovered from a Holder under this Agreement shall be an amount equal
to the aggregate consideration actually received by such Holder under this
Agreement, and any available funds in the Escrow Fund attributable to such
Holder.

Section 8.6 Remedies Not Affected by Investigation, Disclosure or Knowledge.
If the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, each of the Parent
Indemnified Parties and the Holder Indemnified Parties expressly reserve the
right to seek indemnity for any Losses arising out of or relating to any
breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained herein,
notwithstanding any investigation by, disclosure to, knowledge or imputed
knowledge of Parent, the Holders or the Holder Representative or any of their
respective Representatives in respect of any fact or circumstances that
reveals the occurrence of any such breach, whether before or after the
execution and delivery hereof.

Section 8.7 Escrow Fund and Related Matters.



(a) All distributions on the shares of Parent Common Stock held in the Escrow
Fund shall be held by the Escrow Agent and shall without any further act be
deemed attached to the shares of Parent Common Stock to which they pertain.
Solely for the purpose of determining the ownership of the income earned by
the Escrow Fund for applicable income Tax purposes, any shares of Parent
Common Stock or securities distributed in respect thereof shall be treated as
owned by, and any dividends, interest or other income earned on the Escrow
Fund shall be treated as income of, the Holder on whose behalf such securities
or assets giving rise to such interest or other income, as the case may be,
are being held. The Holders shall not have the right to sell, transfer,
pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any cash or securities held in the
Escrow Fund or any interest therein for so long as they are held in the Escrow
Fund. Each Holder shall not be entitled to vote, and shall not be entitled to
instruct the Escrow Agent to vote, the shares of Parent Common Stock held in
the Escrow Fund on behalf of such Holder for so long as they are held by the
Escrow Agent. For purposes of determining the value of any shares of Parent
Common Stock included in the Escrow Fund and for purposes of determining the
amount of any indemnity claim satisfied with shares of Parent Common Stock,
each such share shall be deemed to have a value equal to the Parent Stock
Price.

(b) If a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified for Losses
arising, out of or relating to the causes set forth in Section 8.2(a), the
obligation to pay the amount of indemnification owed hereunder shall be
satisfied only from the Escrow Fund, and any Losses in excess of the Escrow
Fund shall not be recoverable; provided, however, that the foregoing
limitation with respect to Section 8.2(a) shall not apply with respect to
Losses arising out of or relating to the inaccuracy or breach of any
Fundamental Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein
to the contrary, (i) if a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified for Losses arising out of or relating to (A) the inaccuracy or
breach of any Company Fundamental Representation or (B) the inaccuracy or
breach of any representation or warranty in the event of fraud, the Parent
Indemnified Party shall have the choice of seeking recovery against the Escrow
Fund, proceeding directly against the Holders to satisfy their indemnity
obligations hereunder, setting off the amount of any Loss against any amounts
due and unpaid, or otherwise subsequently payable (including the Earnout
Consideration, if any), under this Agreement, or any combination of the
foregoing; (ii) if a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified
for Losses arising out of or relating to causes set forth in a subsection of
Section 8.2 other than subsection (a) or (g), the indemnity obligation shall
be satisfied only from (A) first, the balance then remaining in the Escrow
Fund to the extent such balance exceeds a reasonable reserve for claims then
pending hereunder and (B) then by proceeding directly against the Holders to
satisfy their indemnity obligations thereunder; and (iii) if a Parent
Indemnified Party is entitled to be indemnified for Losses arising out of or
relating to the causes set forth in Section 8.2(g), the indemnity obligation
shall be satisfied only from (A) first, the balance then remaining in the
Escrow Fund to the extent such balance exceeds a reasonable reserve for claims
then pending hereunder and (B) then by setting off the amount of any Loss
against any amount due and unpaid or payable from the Earnout Consideration,
if any, and any such Losses in excess of such amounts shall not be
recoverable.

(c) At the three year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall
pay any amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund (other than (i) a reasonable
reserve for claims then pending under any subsection of Section 8.2 other than
Section 8.2(g) plus (ii) the amount required to be placed in the Special
Escrow at such time, if any, in accordance with Section



8.7(e)) to the Holders as instructed by the Holder Representative. Payment of
such amounts to Holders shall be made pro rata in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Percentages subject to adjustment as contemplated herein.

(d) Notwithstanding the Holders' several (and not joint) liability under
Section 8.2 and notwithstanding Section 8.5(f), the Parent Indemnified Parties
may recover all Losses in respect of Section 8.2 (other than Section 8.2(b) as
a result of a breach by a Holder) from the Escrow Fund without regard to such
limitations applicable to recovery directly from Holders, it being understood
that with respect to Losses arising out of Section 8.2(b) as a result of a
breach of a covenant by a Holder, the Parent Indemnified Parties shall only be
able to recover up to such Holder's remaining Pro Rata Percentage of the
Escrow Amount.

(e) If any indemnity claim is made under Section 8.2(g) prior to or during any
particular Earnout Period (such applicable Earnout Period is referred to as
the "Applicable Earnout Period") and is not finally resolved (i.e. the amount
of the indemnifiable Losses has not been finally determined at such time
(including, without limitation, with respect to matters as to which no
judgment or penalty has been awarded or as to which a judgment or penalty has
been awarded but that judgment or penalty remains subject to appeal)) before
(x) the end of such Applicable Earnout Period or (y) the date of any scheduled
release of amounts from the Escrow Fund (any such claim, a "Special Unresolved
Claim"), such Special Unresolved Claim shall be governed by the following
provisions of this Section 8.7(e):

(i) Parent shall not enter into any settlement with a third party with respect
to any matter that is the subject of the Special Unresolved Claim without the
consent of the chief legal officer of the Surviving Company, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. If Brian Schmidt is not the chief legal
officer of the Surviving Company at such time, the consent of the board of
directors of the Holder Representative shall be required instead, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(ii) Parent and the Holder Representative shall seek to agree upon the portion
of the Escrow Fund that would otherwise be released to the Holder
Representative and/or the portion of the applicable Earnout Amount that
otherwise would be paid to the Holder Representative that instead should be
placed into a special escrow fund (the "Special Escrow") to cover the
anticipated indemnifiable Losses reasonably likely to result from such Special
Unresolved Claim and any other Special Unresolved Claims.

(iii) If Parent and the Holder Representative cannot reach agreement on the
portion of the Escrow Fund to be moved to the Special Escrow and/or the
portion of the applicable Earnout Amount to be placed in the Special Escrow,
they will enter into arbitration (under the principles outlined in Section
10.11 of this Agreement; provided, the provisions of Section 10.11(h)
regarding treble damages shall not apply; provided, further, that for the sake
of clarity each party shall bear its or their own costs of the arbitration,
including attorneys' fees) in which the arbitrators will determine the amounts
to be moved from the Escrow Fund and/or placed into a Special Escrow from the
applicable Earnout Amount to cover the anticipated indemnifiable Losses
pursuant to all Special Unresolved Claims. The standard to be applied in
determining the amounts to be retained in the Escrow Fund and/or placed into a
Special Escrow from the applicable Earnout Amount shall be amounts that will
be sufficient to cover the



"reasonably anticipated Losses for which Parent Indemnified Parties are
seeking indemnification under Section 8.2(g) taking into account all relevant
factors" (the "Anticipated Losses"). Each of the Holder Representative and
Parent will be entitled to present whatever evidence it believes is relevant
and probative as to Anticipated Losses. The funds otherwise to be released
from the Escrow Fund or paid out as Earnout Consideration will be deposited
into (and retained in) the Special Escrow until such arbitration to determine
the amount required to be placed in the Special Escrow is completed (at which
point funds will be released to the Holders or retained in the Special Escrow
to cover any Special Unresolved Claims, as provided in paragraphs (iv) and (v)
below), except for amounts that Parent has not asserted in good faith are
necessary to cover Anticipated Losses or to cover other Losses previously
addressed in other indemnity claims. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event will any portion of an Earnout Amount
for a given year be placed into a Special Escrow to satisfy a Special
Unresolved Claim as to which a Parent Indemnified Party has provided notice of
such claim after the end of the Earnout Period for which such Earnout Amount
relates.

(iv) If, upon completion of any arbitration to determine the amount required
to be placed in the Special Escrow to cover the Anticipated Losses of any
Special Unresolved Claims or upon final resolution of the Special Unresolved
Claims, the amount deposited in the Special Escrow for such Special Unresolved
Claims exceeds the amount of Losses for such claims, the excess will be
released to the Holders together with interest at a rate equal to the rate of
interest from time to time announced publicly by The Wall Street Journal as
its prime rate, calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and the number
of days elapsed from the date such amount would have been released to the
Holders from the Escrow Fund or been paid to the Holders as Earnout Amount to
the date of such release. "Final resolution" of a Special Unresolved Claim for
these purposes means (A) the Holder Representative and Parent's written
agreement as to the amount of Losses applicable to such Special Unresolved
Claims, (B) a final, non-appealable judgment or arbitration award as to the
amount of such Losses or (C) a final binding settlement with a third party
plaintiff with respect to the amount of such Losses.

(v) If, upon final resolution of the Special Unresolved Claims, the
indemnifiable Losses are ultimately determined to be greater than the amount
in such Special Escrow, the amounts in the Special Escrow will be released to
Parent and Parent will retain its rights under this Agreement to pursue
remaining amounts in the Escrow Fund or to offset against any future Earnout
Amounts to cover any such shortfall and to cover any interest owed pursuant to
this Agreement on the amounts recovered by Parent.

(vi) With respect to any Special Unresolved Claims as to which Parent
Indemnified Parties have actually incurred the Losses (for example, by paying
for legal expenses or other indemnifiable Losses) before the scheduled release
of the Escrow Fund and/or before an applicable Earnout Amount would otherwise
become due, such Losses will be addressed pursuant to the other indemnity
provisions contained in this Article VIII (i.e., the Parent Indemnified
Parties will have recourse against the Escrow Fund or a right of offset
against the applicable Earnout Amount to cover such Losses). The foregoing is
not intended to expand the indemnification obligations of the parties set
forth in Article VIII, but rather for clarification.

Section 8.8 Sole and Exclusive Remedy.



(a) From and after the Closing, the right of the Parent Indemnified Parties
and the Holder Indemnified Parties to recovery pursuant to this Article VIII
shall constitute the Parent Indemnified Parties' and Holder Indemnified
Parties' sole and exclusive remedy for any Losses (including any Losses from
claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including
negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict
liability, or otherwise) that any Party may at any time suffer or incur, or
become subject to, as a result of or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any breach of any representation
or warranty in this Agreement by any Party, or any failure by any Party to
perform or comply with any covenant or agreement that, by its terms, was to
have been performed, or complied with, under this Agreement, except with
respect to fraud, which, except for the terms of Section 8.9 hereof, is
outside the scope of this Agreement and is intended as a statutory or common
law remedy not as a contractual remedy. Nothing herein shall be construed to
limit the stockholder rights and remedies (of a nature generally applicable to
stockholders of Parent) of any Holder in its capacity as a holder of Parent
Common Stock.

(b) Each of the Parent Indemnified Parties and the Holder Indemnified Parties
acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, it may not avoid the
limitation on liability set forth in this Article VIII by (x) seeking damages
for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of liability, all
of which are hereby waived, or (y) asserting or threatening any claim against
any Person that is not a party hereto (or a successor to a party hereto) for
breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants contained in this
Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the provisions in this Agreement
relating to indemnification, and the limits imposed on Parent's remedies with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, were
specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and were specifically
taken into account in the determination of the amounts to be paid to the
Holders hereunder. Following the Closing and subject to the foregoing, to the
maximum extent permitted by Law, the Parties hereby waive all other rights and
remedies with respect to any matter in any way relating to this Agreement or
arising in connection herewith, whether under any Laws at common law, in
equity or otherwise.

Section 8.9 No Other Representations; No Reliance.

(a) Each of the parties acknowledges that the detailed representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement have been negotiated at arm's length
among sophisticated business entities. Each party has conducted its own
independent review and analysis of, and, based thereon, has formed an
independent judgment concerning, the business, assets, condition, operations
and prospects of the Company or Parent, as applicable.

(b) In entering into this Agreement, each party has relied solely upon its own
investigation and analysis and the representations and warranties of the
Company expressly contained in Article III as modified by the Disclosure
Schedules, in the case of Parent, or the representations and warranties of
Parent expressly contained in Article IV, in the case of the Company, which
constitute the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of the
parties hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Except
for such representations and warranties, each of Parent and the Company
acknowledges that none of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, any Holder, or any
Person acting on behalf of any of the foregoing makes or has made any other
express or any implied representation or warranty to any party as to the
accuracy



or completeness of any information regarding the Company or Parent or the
condition, value or quality of the shares or business or assets of the Company
or Parent, or the merchantability, usage, suitability or fitness for any
particular purpose with respect to such assets, any part thereof, the
workmanship thereof, and the absence of any defects therein, whether latent or
patent. Without limitation, in connection with Parent's investigation of the
Company, Parent has received from or on behalf of the Company and/or the
Holders certain projections, including projected statements of operating
revenues and income from operations of the Company and certain business plan
information. Parent acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in
attempting to make such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans,
that Parent is familiar with such uncertainties, and that Parent is taking
full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy
of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it
(including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates,
projections and forecasts). EACH PARTY CONFIRMS THAT IT IS NOT RELYING ON ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OTHER THAN THOSE EXPRESSLY CONTAINED ARTICLE III
AND ARTICLE IV AND EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS NO RELIANCE CONFIRMATION
IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO THE OTHER PARTIES' WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT AND CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. WITHOUT
LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, (X) EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE III AS MODIFIED BY THE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES,
THE COMPANY AND THE HOLDERS ARE NOT MAKING AND HAVE NOT MADE ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO MATERIALS FURNISHED TO PARENT OR
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES DURING THE DILIGENCE PROCESS (INCLUDING FINANCIAL
FORECASTS) OR MATTERS THAT WERE DISCUSSED ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE HEREOF OR
OTHERWISE AND (Y) EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE IV, PARENT AND
MERGER SUB ARE NOT MAKING AND HAVE NOT MADE ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY
WITH RESPECT TO MATERIALS FURNISHED TO THE COMPANY, THE HOLDERS OR THEIR
REPRESENTATIVES DURING THE DILIGENCE PROCESS (INCLUDING FINANCIAL FORECASTS)
OR MATTERS THAT WERE DISCUSSED ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE HEREOF OR OTHERWISE.
THE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES IN THIS SECTION 8.10 ARE
INTENDED TO PROVIDE CLARITY THAT THE PARTIES' SOLE LIABILITY ARISING FROM ANY
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY MADE THEREBY WILL BE FOR A BREACH OF A
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT AND NOT FOR ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY. ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES NOT CONTAINED
HEREIN ARE NOT INTENDED TO FORM THE BASIS OF ANY LIABILITY, WHETHER
CONTRACTED, UNDER STATUTE OR UNDER COMMON LAW (INCLUDING STATUTORY OR COMMON
LAW THEORIES OF FRAUD).

ARTICLE IX 
TERMINATION

Section 9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing:



(a) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Company;

(b) (i) by the Company, if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform
in any respect any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained
in this Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to
the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, (B) cannot be or has not
been cured within 15 days following delivery of written notice of such breach
or failure to perform and (C) has not been waived by the Company or (ii) by
Parent, if the Company breaches or fails to perform in any respect any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement and such
breach or failure to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition
set forth in Section 7.3, (B) cannot be or has not been cured within 15 days
following delivery of written notice of such breach or failure to perform and
(C) has not been waived by Parent;

(c) by either the Company or Parent if the Merger shall not have been
consummated by November 24, 2014; provided, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.1(c) shall not be available if the failure of
the party so requesting termination to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, the failure
of the Merger to be consummated on or prior to such date; or

(d) by either the Company or Parent in the event that any Governmental
Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other
action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions and
such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable; provided, that Parent and Merger Sub (if Parent is so
requesting termination) or the Company (if it is so requesting termination),
as the case may be, shall have used their commercially reasonable efforts, in
accordance with Section 5.8, to have such order, decree, ruling or other
action vacated.

The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1
(other than Section 9.1(a)) shall give prompt written notice of such
termination to the other party.

Section 9.2 Effect of Termination.

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 9.1,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability on

to confidentiality, Section 5.11 relating to public announcements, Section

10.8 relating to third-party beneficiaries, Section 10.9 relating to governing
law, Section 10.10 relating to submission to jurisdiction and this Section 9.2
and (ii) that nothing herein shall relieve either party from liability for any
intentional or willful breach of this Agreement.

(b) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2
and elsewhere in this Agreement are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, none of the parties
would have entered into this Agreement.

(c) The Company may, on behalf of itself and the Holders, petition a court to
award damages (beyond reimbursement of the Company's expenses) in connection
with



intentional or willful breaches of this Agreement by Parent and/or Merger Sub.
The Company may, additionally, on behalf of the Holders, enforce such award
and accept damages for such fraud and breaches.

ARTICLE X 
GENERAL PROVISIONS

the Merger is consummated, Transaction Expenses shall be borne and paid as
provided in this Agreement; provided further that Parent shall be solely
responsible for all application fees required in connection with the Original

arising from a breach of this Agreement by the other.

Section 10.2 Amendment and Modification. This Agreement may not be amended,
modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or
otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an

the Holder Representative (on behalf of the Holders, and, before the Closing,
the Company).

Section 10.3 Extension. At any time prior to the Effective Time, Parent (on
behalf of itself and Merger Sub) and the Holder Representative (on behalf of
the Holders and the Company), by action taken or authorized by its respective
Boards of Directors, may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the

as applicable, to any such extension shall be valid only if set forth in a
written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized officer on

applicable Law, (a) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties contained in this Agreement or any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (b) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions of the other parties contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such waiver shall be valid
only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly
authorized officer on behalf of Parent and the Holder Representative. No
failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to
enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The
rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

this Agreement, first attempt to resolve such dispute through meetings and
discussions among senior executives of the parties over a period of 20
Business Days during which time the parties shall work together in good faith
and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute.

(b) Any dispute, claim or controversy arising under this Agreement or the
breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof
(including the determination of the applicability of this agreement to
arbitrate) not resolved by the parties pursuant to Section 10.11(a) shall be
adjudicated by final, binding, expedited and confidential arbitration to be
administered by arbitration at Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services

within 30 days after JAMS receives the demand for arbitration, the arbitrator
shall be selected in accordance with the JAMS rules. JAMS shall have
discretion, in such event, to depart from the arbitrator qualifications
specified above to assemble a list of potential arbitrators, but only to the
minimum degree necessary to carry out selection procedures under its rules.

(d) The arbitration shall be governed by the Delaware Code of Civil Procedure,
except as otherwise indicated in this Section 10.11. The arbitration panel
shall apply the substantive law of the State of Delaware, have authority to
entertain a motion for summary judgment, and apply the standards governing
such motions under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The arbitration panel
shall issue a written award stating findings of fact and conclusions of law.

(e) All depositions shall occur in San Francisco, California, and the parties
will produce witnesses in San Francisco, California within 14 calendar days
after receipt of notice of a deposition. To the extent the arbitration panel
orders any discovery beyond that permitted by the JAMS rules, the arbitration
panel should do so in a manner consistent with the goal of completing the
proceedings within the period specified in Section 10.11(k).

(f) Adherence to this dispute resolution provision shall not limit the
parties' right to obtain any provisional remedy prior to the Closing,
including without limitation, injunctive or similar relief, from any court of
competent jurisdiction specified in Section 10.10, as may be necessary to
protect their rights and interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as
provided in Section 2.14(c) with respect to the calculation of the Closing Net
Working Capital or Section 1.2(b) of the Earnout Provisions with respect to
the calculation of Earnout EBITDA in any Earnout Statement, this dispute
resolution provision is intended to provide the exclusive method of resolving
any claim arising under this Agreement.

(g) Any party may notify JAMS of its intention to appeal the award to another
arbitrator (the "Appeal Arbitrator"). The appeal shall be administered by the
International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution ("CPR") and,
except to the extent modified by this Section 10.11, shall be conducted by a
single arbitrator in accordance with CPR's Rules of Appeal Procedure. The
Appeal Arbitrator shall have at least 10 years' experience as a judge and, (i)
for disputes arising under the Earnout Provisions, experience drafting or
litigating contingent consideration provisions, and (ii) for all other
disputes, experience drafting or litigating merger agreements governed by
Delaware law. If the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator within 30
days of CPR receiving notice of an appeal, CPR shall have discretion, in such
event, to depart from the arbitrator qualifications specified above to
assemble a list of potential arbitrators, but only to the minimum degree
necessary to carry out selection procedures under its rules. The Appeal
Arbitrator shall be entitled to accept the initial award, modify the award, or
substitute his own award. The Appeal Arbitrator shall not take new testimony
or other evidence except to the



limited extent necessary to decide a challenge based on one or more of the
grounds set forth in Section 10 of the Federal Arbitration Act for vacating an
award. The award, as confirmed, modified or replaced by the Appeal Arbitrator,
shall be final and binding, and judgment thereon may be entered by any court
having jurisdiction thereof.

(h) Each party shall bear its or their own costs of the arbitration, including
attorneys' fees, and share equally the arbitration panel's fee and
administrative costs. For purposes of cost sharing, all claimants shall be
considered one party and all respondents shall be considered one party. This
provision shall apply to any appeal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any
arbitration between or among the parties arising under this Agreement other
than under Section 2.14, if a party initiating a claim (the "plaintiff")
against another party (the "defendant") (i) in the case of monetary claims
brought against the defendant, does not prevail with respect to at least 51%
of the aggregate amount in dispute or does not recover at least $1,000,000 in
such dispute or (ii) with respect to non-monetary claims brought against the
defendant, is not the prevailing party as determined solely by the arbitration
panel, the arbitration panel shall award the defendant an amount equal to
three times the defendant's reasonable and documented out of pocket attorneys'
and accountants' fees and costs and related reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in defending such claim, which shall be paid by plaintiff (and if
there are multiple plaintiffs, each plaintiff shall be jointly and severally
liable for 100% of such amount; provided, defendant shall not be entitled to
recover more than 100% of such fees, costs and expenses) in full, in cash, not
later than ten Business Days after the arbitration panel's determination (x)
that attorneys' and accountants' fees and costs and related out-of-pocket
expenses are required to be awarded and (y) the amount of such attorneys' and
accountants' fees and costs and other out-of-pocket expenses payable. For
purposes of the preceding sentence, a party shall be deemed to have initiated
a claim if (1) with respect to matters covered by Article VIII, it has
initiated a claim for indemnification pursuant to Article VIII or (2) with
respect to matters outside of Article VIII (other than Section 2.14), it has
served a notice of objection with respect to any notice, calculation or other
statement of position delivered by another party pursuant to this Agreement.
(For example only and without limitation, if Parent delivers an Earnout
Statement and the TPG CEO or Holder Representative objects to Parent's
calculation of Earnout EBITDA contained therein, the Holder Representative
shall be deemed to be the party that has initiated the arbitration; if Parent
issues a Parent Mandate and the TPG CEO or the Holder Representative objects
to any determination by Parent regarding any adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA
Target for any Earnout Period, the Holder Representative shall be deemed to be
the party that has initiated the arbitration; and if the TPG CEO or the Holder
Representative issues a TPG-Initiated Adjustment Notice and Parent objects to
any determination by the TPG CEO or the Holder Representative regarding any
adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA Target for any Earnout Period, Parent shall
be deemed to be the party that initiated the arbitration.)

(i) The parties shall maintain strict confidentiality with respect to all
aspects of any arbitration commenced pursuant to this Agreement and shall not,
without the prior written consent of all parties to the arbitration, disclose
the fact, conduct or outcome of the arbitration to any non-parties or non-
participants except to the extent required by applicable Law or to the extent
necessary to recognize, confirm or enforce the final award or decision in the
arbitration.

(j) The parties consent to the personal jurisdiction of any U.S. federal or
state court located in the State of Delaware, for the purpose of confirming
any arbitration award and



entering judgment thereon, and irrevocably waive any objection to the laying
of venue of any such action in such court or that any such court is an
inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereby waives any rights such party
may have to personal service of a summons, complaint or other process in
connection with such an action and agrees that service may be made by
registered or certified mail addressed to such party and sent in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.

(k) The JAMS arbitration panel shall all use reasonable efforts to conduct the
hearing and render their decision and award within 120 days of the first
organizational meeting (subject to one extension of no more than 60 days if
ordered by the arbitration panel on a showing by a party of good cause).
Additionally, all parties agree to use reasonable efforts to expedite the
arbitration and any appeal.

Section 10.12 Assignment; Successors. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any party
without the prior written consent of Parent (in the case of an assignment by
the Company) or the Company (in the case of an assignment by Parent or Merger
Sub), and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null
and void; provided, however, that Parent or Merger Sub may assign this
Agreement to (i) any Affiliate of Parent and (ii) any Financing Source (and/or
the agent therefor) under any credit facility that Parent or Merger Sub is a
party to or guarantor of, as collateral security for the obligations of Parent
or Merger Sub thereunder, in each case without the prior consent of the
Company; provided further, that no assignment shall limit the assignor's
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

Section 10.13 Enforcement; Specific Performance. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the parties shall be entitled to
specific performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware (or, if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, in any
appropriate Delaware state or federal court), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement
under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

Section 10.14 Currency. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is
the currency used for all purposes in this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement.

Section 10.15 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any provision or portion of
any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect under any applicable Law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision or



portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been
contained herein.

Section 10.16 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS.

Section 10.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same instrument and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party.

Section 10.18 Facsimile or.pdf Signature. This Agreement may be executed by
facsimile or .pdf signature and a facsimile or .pdf signature shall constitute
an original for all purposes.

Section 10.19 Time of Essence. Time is of the essence with regard to all dates
and time periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement.

Section 10.20 No Presumption Against Drafting Party. Each of Parent, Merger
Sub and the Company acknowledges that each party to this Agreement has been
represented by legal counsel in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any claimed ambiguities in this
Agreement against the drafting party has no application and is expressly
waived.

Section 10.21 Sealed Instrument. Unless doing so violates Delaware Law or
public policy, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and
agrees that, with respect to the survival periods set forth in Section 8.1(a),
it is their intent that this Agreement be, and that it will be treated and
construed as, a sealed instrument under Delaware law, including the statute of
limitations applicable to sealed instruments. No party shall, and each party
shall cause its Affiliates not to, take a position that is inconsistent with
this Section 10.21, whether before any Governmental Authority or otherwise.

Section 10.22 No Vicarious Liability. Except for the Holders' several (but not
joint) liability to the extent provided under Article VIII, this Agreement
shall not create or be deemed to create or permit any personal liability or
obligation on the part of any direct or indirect equityholder of the Company
or Parent or any officer, director, employee, Representative or investor of
any party hereto or any of their respective Affiliates.

Section 10.23 Disclosure Schedules. All Disclosure Schedules attached hereto
(each, a "Schedule" and, collectively, the "Disclosure Schedules") are
incorporated herein and expressly made a part of this Agreement as though
completely set forth herein. All references to this Agreement herein or in any
of the Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to refer to this entire Agreement,
including all Disclosure Schedules. The Disclosure Schedules have been
arranged for purposes of convenience in separately numbered sections
corresponding to the sections of this Agreement; however, except with respect
to Tax matters, any item disclosed in any part,



subpart, section or subsection of the Disclosure Schedule referenced by a
particular section or subsection in this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to every other section and subsection in this
Agreement to the extent the relevance of such disclosure to such other section
or subsection is reasonably apparent on its face, notwithstanding the omission
of an appropriate cross-reference. Any item of information, matter or document
disclosed or referenced in, or attached to, the Disclosure Schedules shall not
(a) be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material", "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement or to
establish a standard of materiality, (b) represent a determination that such
item or matter did not arise in the ordinary course of business, (c)
constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an admission of liability or
obligation regarding such matter, (d) constitute, or be deemed to constitute,
an admission to any third party concerning such item or matter or (e)
constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an admission or indication by the
Company that such item meets any or all of the criteria set forth in this
Agreement for inclusion in the Disclosure Schedules. No disclos94ure in the
Disclosure Schedules relating to any possible breach or violation of any

such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. Capitalized terms
used in the Disclosure Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have the
meanings given to them in this Agreement.

Section 10.24 Waiver of Conflicts. Recognizing that Willkie Farr and Gallagher
LLP ("WFandG") has acted as legal counsel to the Holder Representative and
certain of its Affiliates, and may be deemed to have acted as legal counsel to
the Company prior to Closing, and that WFandG intends to act as legal counsel to
the Holder Representative and its Affiliates after Closing, the Company hereby
waives any conflict that may arise in connection with WFandG representing the
Holder Representative and its Affiliates after Closing with respect to matters
arising under this Agreement.

ANNEX A

EARNOUT PROVISIONS

Section 1.1 Earnout Generally.

(a) Generally. These earnout provisions set forth in this Annex A (the
"Earnout Provisions") are part of and incorporated by reference into that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), dated as of September
17, 2014, by and among Green Dot Corporation, a Delaware corporation
("Parent"), Patriot Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent, SBBT Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the "Company"), Torrey Holdings, LLCs, a Delaware limited
liability company, solely in its capacity as the initial Holder
Representative, and the Persons delivering Joinder Agreements therewith, to
which this Annex A is attached. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise
defined herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Agreement.

(b) Operating Plan. In June 2014, certain Holders and members of the Company's
management presented their fiscal year 2014-2017 operating plan to Parent's
banking representatives and executives. This operating plan contained detailed
income statement forecasts, which indicated specific revenue and EBITDA
results for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 and projected revenue and
EBITDA targets for its fiscal years ending June 30, 2015, June 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2017. The forecast was formulated based on specific account-level
detail for each relevant Company business partner. Based on the level of
detail used to create the forecast for each Company account and the extensive
internal dialogue and evaluation undertaken by the Company's management to
prepare the operating plan and forecast, the Company's management has stated
its belief that the operating plan and forecast presented to Parent is both
realistic and achievable. Such operating plan and forecast (as updated through
the date hereof) is attached as Attachment 1 to this Annex A and is referred
to herein as the "Operating Plan." For purposes of clarity, (i) the Operating
Plan does not contemplate any business activity related to the making or
collection of refund anticipation loans, (ii) the Operating Plan contemplates
each of the Key Employee Assumptions and (iii) neither the Company nor any
Holder is making any representation or warranty about the Operating Plan or
the assumptions underlying such plan other than the Company's representations
and warranties set forth in Article III of the Agreement as modified by the
Disclosure Schedules.

(c) Material Inducement. The parties acknowledge and agree that: (i) the
achievement by the Company of the Earnout EBITDA Target in each Earnout Period
is a material factor in determining Parent's valuation of the Company; and
(ii) the opportunity to earn additional Merger Consideration pursuant to these
Earnout Provisions is a material inducement for the Holders to enter into the
Agreement. Accordingly, each Holder will be entitled to receive such Holder's
Pro Rata Percentage of each of the 2015 Earnout Amount, the 2016 Earnout
Amount and the 2017 Earnout Amount (in each case, after such Earnout Amounts
have been reduced by any amounts payable to certain pre-Closing employees of
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to the retention plan
established by the Company prior to Closing and disclosed to Parent) payable
in cash, in each case only to the extent earned and payable as provided in
these Earnout Provisions and subject to any applicable tax withholding (such
consideration, collectively, the "Earnout Consideration"). 

Section 1.2 Reporting; Determination and Payment of Earnout Amounts.

(a) Within 30 days after the last day of each calendar month during each
Earnout Period, the TPG CEO will provide Parent with consolidated financial
statements of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries for such calendar
month, including a balance sheet as of the end of such month and an income
statement and statement of cash flows for such month, in each case, prepared
in accordance with the Earnout Accounting Principles, and the management of
the Surviving Company will also compute the Earnout EBITDA for such calendar
month (as to each month, such month's "Monthly Financials"). Parent will not
be obligated to respond to or comment on the Monthly Financials, and failure
by Parent to respond to or comment on the Monthly Financials will not be used
or construed as evidence of Parent's approval or consent to any item included
therein or excluded therefrom. Upon request, the TPG CEO promptly will furnish
the Holder Representative with a copy of the Monthly Financials and an
opportunity to ask questions of, and obtain answers from, the Surviving
Company's management with respect thereto; provided, however, that the Holder
Representative agrees to maintain the confidentiality of such Monthly
Financials until the material parts thereof become publicly available or more
recent consolidated financial statements of Parent become publicly available,
in each case other than as a result of an action by the Holder Representative,
and abide by all applicable securities Laws with respect to the use or
possession of material non-public information concerning Parent and its
Subsidiaries; provided, further, that the Holder Representative may disclose
the foregoing information if the Holder Representative is required, as advised
by its outside legal counsel, to disclose such information by Law or by
deposition, interrogatory, requests for information or documents by a
governmental entity, subpoena or similar process (provided, that the Holder
Representative shall first promptly notify Parent in writing of the existence,
terms and circumstances surrounding such request, shall (at Parent's expense)
cooperate with Parent in connection with Parent seeking any protective order
or other appropriate remedy, and, if and to the extent, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver by Parent of this provision, the
Holder Representative is legally required, as advised by its outside legal
counsel, to disclose any such information or else suffer exposure to censure
or civil or criminal fine or penalty, shall disclose only that portion of such
information that such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed and
shall use reasonable efforts (at Parent's expense) to obtain reliable
assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to any such
information so required to be disclosed).

(b) Within 60 days after the end of each Earnout Period, Parent will prepare
and deliver to the Holder Representative (i) consolidated financial statements
of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries for such Earnout Period,
including a balance sheet as of the end of such period and an income statement
and statement of cash flows for such 12-month period, in each case, prepared
in accordance with the Earnout Accounting Principles, and (ii) Parent's
calculation, in reasonable detail, of Earnout EBITDA for such period (each, an
"Earnout Statement"). At the Holder Representative's request made within 30
days after the Earnout Statement is delivered to the Holder Representative,
Parent will arrange for the Holder Representative and its Representatives to
meet with (in person or by teleconference) the Surviving Company's management
and Parent's outside accounting firm regarding such Earnout Statement and the
calculations of Earnout EBITDA to provide an opportunity for the Holder
Representative to ask questions and obtain answers with respect to the
financial information provided to it. In connection with any such meeting,
Parent 

will provide, and, if necessary, request its outside accounting firm to
provide, reasonable backup information and records regarding Parent's
calculation of Earnout EBITDA. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that such meeting occurs within 15 days after the Holder
Representative's request is made. The "Earnout Reference Date" for each
Earnout Period means the later of (A) the last day of the 30-day period during
which the Holder Representative is permitted to request a meeting or (B) if
the Holder Representative requests a meeting during such 30-day period, the
date such meeting occurs. The Holder Representative will have 15 days after
the Earnout Reference Date (as to each Earnout Period, its "Objection Period")
to object (in writing) to any item in the Earnout Statement specifying in
reasonable detail the item objected to and the basis for such objection (the
"Notice of Objection"). Any Notice of Objection pursuant to this Section
1.2(b) may relate only to how Earnout EBITDA has been calculated (and not the
EBITDA Target) and may only reference disagreements based on mathematical
errors or disputes as to whether the Earnout EBITDA has been determined in
accordance with this Annex A. If a timely Notice of Objection is not received
before the end of the Objection Period, the Holder Representative will be
deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts in the Earnout Statement, and
the Earnout Statement (and the portion of the Earnout Amount to be paid, if
any) will be final and binding on all of the parties. If a Notice of Objection
is received before the expiration of the Objection Period, Parent and the
Holder Representative shall resolve any disputed items reflected in such
Notice of Objection in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set
forth in Section 1.9 of this Annex A.

(c) Payment of Earnout Amounts. Subject to the remaining Earnout Provisions,
no later than 10 Business Days after the end of the Objection Period, Parent
will pay, or cause to be paid, subject to Parent's right to set off Earnout
Offset Losses pursuant to Section 8.7(b) of the Agreement, to each Holder its
Pro Rata Percentage of the portion of the Earnout Amount that is not in
dispute. Subject to the remaining Earnout Provisions, no later than 10
Business Days after the final resolution of any objection raised by the Holder
Representative in the Notice of Objection for the Earnout Period at hand,
Parent will pay, or cause to be paid, subject to Parent's right to set off
Earnout Offset Losses pursuant to Section 8.7(b) of the Agreement, to each
Holder its Pro Rata Percentage of the portion of the Earnout Amount that is
finally resolved. For example, if Parent's Earnout Statement for the 2015
Earnout Period shows a $20 million Earnout Amount as owing, and the Holder
Representative's Notice of Objection claims that a $23 million Earnout Amount
is owing, then the $20 million portion of the Earnout Amount will be payable
within 10 Business Days after the end of the Objection Period, and the
remaining $3 million payment will only be payable if and to the extent it is
owed as determined by the dispute resolution procedures set forth in, or
incorporated by reference in, this Annex A. Payments that are disputed and
ultimately become due will bear interest at a rate equal to the rate of
interest from time to time announced publicly by The Wall Street Journal as
its prime rate, calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days, from the 10th
Business Day after the end of the Objection Period until the date paid in
full.

(d) Earnout Employee Condition. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, it is a condition of each Earnout Employee's entitlement to
receive his allocable portion of any Earnout Amount that such Earnout Employee
will remain continuously employed by the Company (or one of its Subsidiaries)
(other than absences due to vacation permitted by Surviving Company policy,
paid time off, documented illness or short-term disability or documented
serious illness of any immediate family member of such employee) through and
including the last 

Business Day of each applicable Earnout Period, unless such Earnout Employee
is terminated without Cause, terminates his employment for Good Reason or
ceases to be employed by the Company or one of its Subsidiaries due to death
or total disability (the "Earnout Employee Condition"). If any Earnout
Employee fails to satisfy the Earnout Employee Condition, the portion of an
Earnout Amount that otherwise would be payable to such Earnout Employee will
be reallocated ratably to the Eligible Earnout Employees in accordance with
their respective relative Pro Rata Percentages (or, if no other individual is
an Eligible Earnout Employee at such time, to the other Holders ratably in
accordance with their Pro Rata Percentages). For the avoidance of doubt,
Parent will not retain any portion of an Earnout Amount that is reallocated
pursuant to this paragraph.

Section 1.3 Operations of the Surviving Company During Earnout Period. It is
the parties' expectation that, in agreeing to base a portion of the Merger
Consideration on these Earnout Provisions, the management of the Surviving
Company will operate the business of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries as an independent entity and will execute their business
activities in accordance with the Operating Plan because the performance
criteria set forth in these Earnout Provisions have been developed based on a
continuation of such operations in accordance with the Operating Plan. At the
same time, the parties acknowledge that Parent, as the owner of the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, will have the right
to implement any change to the operations of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries (by way of a "Parent Mandate", as defined below) that it
determines in its sole and absolute discretion are in Parent's and its
stockholders' best interests. In order to fairly and equitably reconcile (x)
the parties' general expectation that management of the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries will operate the business as an independent entity consistent
with the Operating Plan and (y) the parties' recognition that deviations from
the Operating Plan may nonetheless be mandated by Parent, the parties have set
forth in this Section 1.3 and Section 1.4 a set of principles that will govern
the operations of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries by management of
the Surviving Company and the consequences, if any, that arise in the event
that Parent issues a Parent Mandate or the TPG CEO issues a TPG-Initiated
Adjustment Notice.

(a) Separate Business Unit. From the Closing Date through and including the
end of the 2017 Earnout Period, the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
will be operated by management of the Surviving Company as a separate business
unit of Parent with distinct books and records so as to facilitate the
determination of Earnout EBITDA attributable to the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries for each of the 2015 Earnout Period, 2016 Earnout Period and 2017
Earnout Period.

(b) Operations by Management; Management Discretion. From the Closing Date
through and including the end of the 2017 Earnout Period, the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries will be under the day-to-day operation and
management of the senior management of the Surviving Company, and, subject to
the provisions of this Annex A, will have complete discretion to operate the
business of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries. Management of the
Surviving Company must conduct the business of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries in accordance with the Operating Plan, except in the case of (A)
a Parent Mandate, (B) a voluntary modification by management of the Surviving
Company in order to comply with TPG Requirements or Parent Laws, (C) a TPG New
Idea (as defined below) approved by the Parent CEO, (D) a Parent New Idea 

(as defined below) approved by the TPG CEO or (E) the effect of Parent
Allocable Items on the business of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries.
The TPG CEO must provide the Parent CEO with 30 days advance written notice of
any Key Employee Change to the extent such Key Employee Change is to be
effected by action of the Surviving Company (as opposed to action of any
employee), and any such Key Employee Change will require the written approval
of the Parent CEO.

(c) Compliance with Law. Management of the Surviving Company will be required
to run the business in accordance with existing and/or future applicable law
and applicable regulation. Except as provided in Section 1.4 with respect to
Parent Laws, any negative financial impact to operations and Earnout EBITDA
resulting from compliance with current or new laws or regulations will not
give rise to any adjustments to the Earnout EBITDA Target in any period or
otherwise serve as a basis for an adjustment to Earnout EBITDA in determining
achievement of the Earnout Amount, since whether or not Parent owned the
Surviving Company, the management of the Surviving Company on an independent
basis would still be obligated to run the business and/or modify the business
to be in compliance with such applicable laws and regulations other than
Parent Laws. Likewise, management of the Surviving Company will be required to
run the business in accordance with existing and/or future contracts and
covenants binding on the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except
for adjustments that result from a Parent Mandate or a Parent Allocable Item
that is not also a TPG Requirement, any negative financial impact to
operations and Earnout EBITDA resulting from compliance with such current or
future contracts or covenants binding on the Surviving Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will not give rise to any adjustments to the Earnout EBITDA
Target in any period or otherwise serve as a basis for an adjustment to
Earnout EBITDA in determining achievement of the Earnout Amount.

(d) Parent Compliance Initiatives. As a private company, certain of the
Surviving Company's operating systems, operating methods, policies, or
procedures may not be in compliance with the Parent Laws. To the extent that
investment or expense is required to bring any operating systems, operating
methods, policies or procedures into compliance with Parent Laws, either (i)
Parent will directly pay for the Parent Allocable Items at its own expense
such that the costs of such initiatives will not reduce the Earnout EBITDA for
the applicable Earnout Period or (ii) if Parent Allocable Items are incurred
by the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries, an adjustment to the Earnout
EBITDA Target for the applicable Earnout Period will be made pursuant to
Section 1.4(c)(i). The Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries will cooperate
and make available the relevant Surviving Company personnel in order to
facilitate the timely implementation of such Compliance Initiative by Parent's
consultants and employees, and the incidental internal (i.e., non-out-of-
pocket) costs in providing assistance and cooperation incurred by the
Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries in providing such cooperation and
assistance, including the compensation of such Surviving Company personnel who
are made available to assist (collectively "TPG Incidental Compliance Costs"),
will not give rise to an adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA Target for any
Earnout Period pursuant to Section 1.4(c)(i) or otherwise serve as a basis for
an adjustment to Earnout EBITDA in determining achievement of the Earnout
Amount.

(e) New Ideas. 

(i) If, during any Earnout Period, management of the Surviving Company
develops a new business initiative, business activity or operating method that
was not previously contemplated in the Operating Plan (a "TPG New Idea"), the
TPG CEO will propose such new idea to the Parent CEO for approval in writing.
If approved by the Parent CEO in writing, management of the Surviving Company
will be free to develop and execute the TPG New Idea as it has been proposed,
with all expenses and revenue associated therein being included in the
Surviving Company's performance. In other words, if the TPG New Idea is a big
success and drives incremental revenue and EBITDA during such Earnout Period,
then this incremental revenue and EBITDA will create a tail-wind for the
Surviving Company towards achieving the Earnout EBITDA Target in any
applicable Earnout Period. However, if the TPG New Idea is not successful and
the costs of executing the new initiative exceed the financial benefit, then
the resulting loss of EBITDA will create a head-wind for the Surviving Company
towards achieving the Earnout EBITDA Target in any applicable Earnout Period.
In any event, because such TPG New Idea was not part of the Operating Plan,
Parent is not obligated to approve such a TPG New Idea and Parent's lack of
approval will not be a reason to adjust the Earnout EBITDA Target in any
applicable Earnout Period or otherwise serve as a basis for an adjustment to
Earnout EBITDA in determining achievement of the Earnout Amount. As provided
in Section 1.4, if Parent issues an instruction to the Surviving Company to
cease engaging in any TPG New Idea or other activity not contemplated by the
Operating Plan, such Parent Mandate will not be a reason to adjust the Earnout
EBITDA Target in any applicable Earnout Period or otherwise serve as a basis
for an adjustment to Earnout EBITDA in determining achievement of the Earnout
Amount.

(ii) If, during any Earnout Period, Parent develops a new business initiative,
business activity or operating method not contemplated by the Operating Plan
that it would like to propose to management of the Surviving Company (a
"Parent New Idea"), the Parent CEO will propose such a new idea to the TPG CEO
for his feedback and approval. If approved by TPG's CEO Parent and the
Surviving Company would negotiate and enter into an arms-length commercial
agreement ("Commercial Agreement") between Parent and the Surviving Company
which would include the terms of any economic consideration to the Surviving
Company. Upon execution of the Commercial Agreement, Parent management and
management of the Surviving Company would be free to work together to develop
and execute the Parent New Idea. The resulting economics to the Surviving
Company will be included on the Surviving Company's income statement and will,
therefore, be reflected in the Surviving Company's financial performance and
Earnout EBITDA towards the achievement of the Earnout EBITDA Target in any
applicable Earnout Period. To the extent that the resulting economics to the
Surviving Company are positive, then it will create a tail-wind for the
Surviving Company towards achieving the Earnout EBITDA Target in any
applicable Earnout Period. However, if the resulting economics are negative,
then the resulting loss of Earnout EBITDA will create a head-wind for the
Surviving Company towards achieving the Earnout EBITDA Target in any
applicable Earnout Period.

(f) Financing and Other Capital Resources. Except as provided in Section
5.9(d) of the Agreement, Parent has no obligation to provide capital (other
than capital from operations of the Surviving Company's business operated in
accordance with the Operating Plan) or non-capital resources of Parent (as
distinguished from resources of the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries
existing on the date hereof or available to the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries 

in the operation of the Surviving Company's business in accordance with the
Operating Plan) to the Surviving Company to assist the Surviving Company in
achieving the Earnout EBITDA Target. All excess cash generated by the
Surviving Company in the operation of its business and not required for the
Operating Plan will be distributed upstream to Parent.

(g) Parent Discretion. The parties acknowledge and agree that nothing
contained in this Section 1.3 or otherwise in these Earnout Provisions is
intended or will be construed to restrict Parent's absolute discretion and
control with respect to the operation of the Surviving Company and its
business following the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section 1.3, Parent may issue a Parent Mandate to the Surviving Company, and
Section 1.4 governs the changes, if any, to the Earnout EBITDA Target in any
applicable Earnout Period resulting from such Parent Mandate. Parent also has
the authority to instruct management to add, delete or modify a particular
business initiative, business activity or operating method that was not part
of the Operating Plan (including, without limitation, an instruction to
refrain from undertaking an Acquisition), and Parent does not need to issue a
formal Parent Mandate with respect to any such matter.

Section 1.4 Parent Mandates and Adjustments to Earnout EBITDA Target. This
Section 1.4 sets forth the parties' agreement regarding Parent's right to
issue Parent Mandates and the TPG CEO's right to issue TPG-Initiated
Adjustment Notices and the rules for determining whether or not any
adjustments will be made to the Earnout EBITDA Target for any relevant Earnout
Period as a result of any such Parent Mandate or TPG-Initiated Adjustment
Notice. Any adjustments to the Earnout EBITDA Target for any relevant Earnout
Period required by this Annex A shall be determined in accordance with this
Section 1.4.

(a) Parent Mandates.

(i) From time to time during an Earnout Period, Parent may issue a Parent
Mandate to the TPG CEO with a concurrent written notice delivered to the
Holder Representative. If Parent in good faith believes that a Parent Mandate
will result in an adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA Target for any applicable
Earnout Period based on the principles set forth in Section 1.4(c), the Parent
Mandate will specify in reasonable detail any proposed adjustment to the
Earnout EBITDA Target for the applicable Earnout Periods and the basis
therefor and will attach reasonable backup documentation for such proposed
adjustment(s).

(ii) If the TPG CEO approves in writing any Parent Mandate that does not
propose an adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA Target for any Earnout Period,
such Parent Mandate will not result in any adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA
Target for any Earnout Period and none of the Holders or the Holder
Representative will be entitled to assert any adjustment therefor. Within 15
Business Days after Parent issues a Parent Mandate for any reason, the TPG CEO
may provide written notice to Parent with a copy to the Holder Representative
(a "Parent Mandate Adjustment Notice") (i) objecting in good faith to any
proposed adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA Target specified therein, specifying
in reasonable detail the item(s) objected to and the basis for such objection
and proposing counter-adjustments based on the principles set forth in Section
1.4(c), if any (together with reasonable backup documentation for such
proposed counter-adjustment(s)) or (ii) if such Parent Mandate did not contain
any proposed adjustment(s) to the Earnout EBITDA Target for any Earnout
Period, that such Parent Mandate requires an adjustment 

to the Earnout EBITDA Target for one or more Earnout Periods based on the
principles set forth in Section 1.4(c), specifying in reasonable detail any
such adjustment(s) and the basis therefor and attaching reasonable backup
documentation for such proposed adjustment(s). If the TPG CEO does not deliver
a Parent Mandate Adjustment Notice within such 15 Business Day period, such
Parent Mandate will be deemed approved by the TPG CEO and the adjustment(s)
specified therein, if any, will be conclusive and binding on all parties or if
no adjustments are specified therein such Parent Mandate will not result in
any adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA Target for any Earnout Periods and none
of the Holders or the Holder Representative will be entitled to assert any
adjustment therefor. If the TPG CEO does deliver a Parent Mandate Adjustment
Notice within such 15 Business Day period, then the Parent CEO, TPG CEO and
the Holder Representative will promptly meet and confer regarding such Parent
Mandate Adjustment Notice. The Parent CEO, TPG CEO and the Holder
Representative will endeavor in good faith within 15 days after the date of
the Parent Mandate Adjustment Notice to reach agreement regarding the
adjustments to the Earnout EBITDA Target to be made for the applicable Earnout
Periods. In the event the Parent CEO, TPG CEO and the Holder Representative
are unable to resolve any such disputes within such 15-day period, then Parent
and the Holder Representative will mutually agree on one mediator not
affiliated with either party to assist in resolving such disputes. Parent and
the Holder Representative will cooperate with one another in selecting a
mediator and in scheduling mediation proceedings, will act in good faith in
such mediation, will share equally in the costs of any such mediation, and
will use good faith efforts to cause such mediation to be completed within 60
days after the date on which the TPG CEO delivered its Parent Mandate
Adjustment Notice. If a resolution is not agreed upon after completion of such
mediation, Parent and the Holder Representative will resolve such disagreement
in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.9 of this Annex A.
For the avoidance of doubt, the sole recourse of the Holder Representative or
any other Holder with respect to any dispute or disagreement regarding any
adjustments to the EBITDA Target resulting from any Parent Mandate will be
pursuant to the dispute procedure and dispute resolution process set forth in
this Section 1.4(a)(ii) and, if not resolved pursuant to such procedure and
process, in accordance with the dispute resolution provisions set forth in
Section 1.9 of this Annex A, and, except as otherwise provided in this Section
1.4, there will be no adjustments to the Earnout EBITDA Target resulting from
any changes in operations of the Surviving Company.

(b) TPG-Initiated Adjustments.

(i) From time to time during an Earnout Period, the TPG CEO may issue written
notice to the Parent CEO (with a concurrent written notice to the Holder
Representative) that (A) the Surviving Company will incur, other than as a
result of a Parent Mandate, an increase in expenses or a reduction in revenue
as a result of Parent Allocable Items or (B) a Specified Customer Event has
occurred due to an action or omission by Parent or its Affiliates (other than
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries) (each such notice, a "TPG-
Initiated Adjustment Notice"). Such TPG-Initiated Adjustment Notice will
specify in reasonable detail any proposed adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA
Target for the applicable Earnout Periods and the basis therefor and will
attach reasonable backup documentation for such proposed adjustment(s).

(ii) If the Parent CEO approves in writing any TPG-Initiated Adjustment
Notice, the adjustment(s) so specified in such notice will be conclusive and
binding on all parties. 

Within 15 Business Days after the TPG CEO issues a TPG-Initiated Adjustment
Notice for any reason, the Parent CEO may provide written notice to the TPG
CEO with a copy to the Holder Representative (a "TPG-Initiated Adjustment
Objection") objecting in good faith to any proposed adjustment to the Earnout
EBITDA Target specified therein, specifying in reasonable detail the item(s)
objected to and the basis for such objection and proposing counter-adjustments
based on the principles set forth in Section 1.4(c), if any (together with
reasonable backup documentation for such proposed counter-adjustment(s)). If
the Parent CEO does not deliver a TPG-Initiated Adjustment Objection within
such 15 Business Day period, such TPG-Initiated Adjustment Notice will be
deemed approved by the Parent CEO and the adjustment(s) specified therein will
be conclusive and binding on all parties. If the Parent CEO does deliver a
TPG-Initiated Adjustment Objection within such 15 Business Day period, then
the Parent CEO, TPG CEO and the Holder Representative will promptly meet and
confer regarding such TPG-Initiated Adjustment Objection. The Parent CEO, TPG
CEO and the Holder Representative will endeavor in good faith within 15 days
after the date of the TPG-Initiated Adjustment Objection to reach agreement
regarding the adjustments to the Earnout EBITDA Target to be made for the
applicable Earnout Periods. In the event the Parent CEO, TPG CEO and the
Holder Representative are unable to resolve any such disputes within such
15-day period, then Parent and the Holder Representative will mutually agree
on one mediator not affiliated with either party to assist in resolving such
disputes. Parent and the Holder Representative will cooperate with one another
in selecting a mediator and in scheduling mediation proceedings, will act in
good faith in such mediation, will share equally in the costs of any such
mediation, and will use good faith efforts to cause such mediation to be
completed within 60 days after the date on which the Parent CEO delivered its
TPG-Initiated Adjustment Objection. If a resolution is not agreed upon after
completion of such mediation, Parent and the Holder Representative will
resolve such disagreement in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 1.9 of this Annex A. For the avoidance of doubt, the sole recourse of
all parties with respect to any dispute or disagreement regarding any
adjustments to the EBITDA Target resulting from a TPG-Initiated Adjustment
Notice will be pursuant to the dispute procedure and dispute resolution
process set forth in this Section 1.4(b)(ii) and, if not resolved pursuant to
such procedure and process, in accordance with the dispute resolution
provisions set forth in Section 1.9 of this Annex A, and, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 1.4, there will be no adjustments to the Earnout
EBITDA Target resulting from any changes in operations of the Surviving
Company.

(c) Principles for Adjusting the Earnout EBITDA Target as a Result of a Parent
Mandate or TPG-Initiated Adjustment Notice. For purposes of determining any
adjustments to the Earnout EBITDA Target for any Earnout Period and the
resolution of any disputes with respect to such adjustments pursuant to
Section 1.4(a), the following principles will govern: (x) if the actions
contemplated by the Parent Mandate or a TPG-Initiated Adjustment Notice result
in an increase in costs or reduction in revenue to the Surviving Company or
its Subsidiaries with respect to any activity as compared to the Operating
Plan, the Earnout EBITDA Target for the applicable Earnout Period will be
adjusted downward to account for such incremental additional costs or loss of
revenue; (y) if the actions contemplated by the Parent Mandate or a TPG-
Initiated Adjustment Notice result in a decrease in costs or increase in
revenue to the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to any
activity as compared to the Operating Plan, the Earnout EBITDA Target for the
applicable Earnout Period will be adjusted upward to account for such
incremental reduction in costs or increase in revenue; and (z) if the actions
contemplated by the Parent Mandate or a TPG- 

Initiated Adjustment Notice will result in a reduction in revenue attributable
to any customer of the Surviving Company that was a customer as of the
Effective Time, the Earnout EBITDA Target for the applicable Earnout Period
will be adjusted downward to account for such reduction in revenue.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following specific rules will apply:

(i) Parent Allocable Item. The Earnout EBITDA Target for the applicable
Earnout Period will be adjusted downward by the amount of any expenses or the
loss or revenue arising from a Parent Allocable Item (A) required to be
incurred in such Earnout Period pursuant to a Parent Mandate or (B) described
in a TPG-Initiated Adjustment Notice and finally determined to result in an
adjustment pursuant to Section 1.4(b). To the extent a Parent Mandate includes
changes in operations required to comply with the Parent Laws (the changes
specified in such Parent Mandate, a "Compliance Initiative"), any expenses or
loss of revenue arising from such Parent Allocable Item by the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries (other than TPG Incidental Compliance Costs) will
result in a corresponding downward adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA Target.
The Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries will cooperate and make available
the relevant Surviving Company personnel in order to facilitate the timely
implementation of such Compliance Initiative by Parent's consultants and
employees; and the TPG Incidental Compliance Costs will not constitute Parent
Allocable Items and therefore will be disregarded in calculating the amount of
any downward adjustment. In addition, to the extent a TPG-Initiated Adjustment
Notice relates to changes in operations that Parent asserts in a TPG-Initiated
Adjustment Objection are required to comply with TPG Requirements rather than
Parent Laws, the mediation and dispute resolution procedures set forth in
Section 1.4(b)(ii) above will include a determination of whether the changes
are required to comply with Parent Laws or TPG Requirements and therefore
whether any incremental expenses incurred as a result of such changes
constitute Parent Allocable Items or TPG Requirement Expenses.

(ii) Tax Industry Expenses. The Earnout EBITDA Target for the applicable
Earnout Period will not be adjusted by the amount of any TPG Requirement
Expenses required to be incurred in such Earnout Period pursuant to a Parent
Mandate. To the extent a Parent Mandate includes changes in operations that
Parent asserts in such Parent Mandate are required to comply with the TPG
Requirements and the Parent Mandate Adjustment Notice objects in good faith to
Parent's determination that such changes are required to comply with TPG
Requirements, the mediation and dispute resolution procedures set forth in
Section 1.4(a)(ii) above will include a determination of whether the changes
are required to comply with TPG Requirements or Parent Laws and therefore
whether any incremental expenses incurred as a result of such changes
constitute TPG Requirement Expenses or Parent Allocable Items. In addition, to
the extent a TPG-Initiated Adjustment Notice relates to changes in operations
that Parent asserts in a TPG-Initiated Adjustment Objection are required to
comply with the TPG Requirements, the mediation and dispute resolution
procedures set forth in Section 1.4(b)(ii) above will include a determination
of whether the changes are required to comply with TPG Requirements or Parent
Laws and therefore whether any incremental expenses incurred as a result of
such changes constitute TPG Requirement Expenses or Parent Allocable Items.
For clarity, it is the parties' understanding that management of the Surviving
Company will at all times conduct the business of the Surviving Company and
its Subsidiaries in compliance with TPG Requirements. 

(iii) Parent Cost Allocations. To the extent, in any Earnout Period, a Parent
Mandate allocates to the Surviving Company or any of its Subsidiaries (by way
of intercompany charges or by requiring the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries to incur costs directly) any costs and expenses, including, for
example, payment or bank processing fees, insurance costs, IT support costs,
costs of employee benefits and other Parent GandA expenses that are in addition
to or in excess of those that are contemplated to be incurred by the Surviving
Company and its Subsidiaries in the Operating Plan or then being obtained by
the Surviving Company and its Subsidiaries in the market, then the Earnout
EBITDA Target for such Earnout Period will be adjusted downward by the amount
of such additional or excess costs so allocated to the Company or its
Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, repayment of Parent Debt and
intercompany charges imposed on the Surviving Company in respect of Parent
Debt will not result in an adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA Target.

(iv) Increase in Key Employee Compensation. If, in any Earnout Period, a
Parent Mandate increases the salary or bonus payable to any Key Employee such
that the aggregate amount of salary and bonus payable to such Key Employee in
such Earnout Period exceeds the maximum aggregate amount of salary and bonus
payable to such Key Employee under the Key Employee Assumptions, the Earnout
EBITDA Target for such Earnout Period will be adjusted downward by the amount
of such excess.

(v) Specified Customer Event. If, prior to the end of the 2017 Earnout Period,
the Specified Customer Event occurs, then the Earnout EBITDA Target for the
applicable Earnout Period(s) will be adjusted downward by the amount of
revenue attributable to such terminated contracts during such Earnout
Period(s) had they not been terminated, and the Earnout EBITDA Target for the
applicable Earnout Period(s) will be adjusted upward by the amount of any
costs that are not incurred in such Earnout Period(s) as a result of such
contracts being terminated.

(d) Limitation on Adjustments; Holder Acknowledgement; Sole Remedies. For
clarity, (i) a TPG New Idea or a Parent New Idea implemented pursuant to
Section 1.3(e) will not result in any adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA Target
for any Earnout Period or otherwise serve as a basis for an adjustment to
Earnout EBITDA in determining achievement of the Earnout Amount and (ii) if
Parent instructs management to add, delete or modify a particular business
initiative, business activity or operating method that was not part of the
Operating Plan (including, without limitation, an instruction to refrain from
undertaking an Acquisition), such instruction, so long as it is a Parent New
Idea and implemented pursuant to Section 1.3(e) or such instruction is not a
Parent Allocable Item that results in an adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA
Target for any Earnout Period pursuant to a TPG-Initiated Adjustment, will not
result in any adjustment to the Earnout EBITDA Target for any Earnout Period
or otherwise serve as a basis for an adjustment to Earnout EBITDA in
determining achievement of the Earnout Amount because the resulting
implications from such an instruction would not impact the Operating Plan on
which the Earnout EBITDA Target for each Earnout Period was based. The parties
have agreed that certain specified adjustments will be made to the calculation
of Earnout EBITDA in the manner and to the extent set forth in the definition
of Earnout EBITDA and to the Earnout EBITDA Target in the manner and to the
extent set forth in this Section 1.4 of this Annex A. However, the parties
acknowledge and agree that nothing contained in Section 1.4 or otherwise in
these Earnout Provisions is intended or will be 

construed to restrict Parent's absolute discretion and control with respect to
the operation of the Surviving Company and its business following the
Effective Time or to give the Holder Representative, any Holder or any other
Person any right to challenge, dispute, modify, delay or prevent in any
respect the execution of any decision or directive of Parent (including any
Parent Mandate) with respect to the operation of the Surviving Company and its
Subsidiaries other than the impact of such operations on the Earnout EBITDA
Target. Except for any claim or dispute that the Holder Representative may
assert pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.9 of this Annex A, which
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy applicable to any disputes relating
to the Earnout Provisions, the Holders and the Holder Representative hereby
waive and disclaim any claim, right or cause of action on any basis whatsoever
against Parent related to its operation of the Surviving Company after the
Effective Time (including, without limitation, any claim, right or cause of
action to the effect that any action or inaction on the part of Parent or any
of its Affiliates with respect to the operation of the Surviving Company
caused the Surviving Company to fail to achieve the Earnout EBITDA Target)
except its rights under the Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. The
Holders and the Holder Representative expressly agree and acknowledge that the
foregoing waiver and disclaimer has served as a material inducement to Parent
to enter into the Agreement.

Section 1.5 Forfeited Amounts. All Earnout Amounts that are not earned
pursuant to these Earnout Provisions by reason of the Earnout Coefficient
being zero in any Earnout Period will be forfeited and retained permanently by
Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, any Earnout Amounts that have been earned
but are forfeited by an Earnout Employee due to such Earnout Employee's
failure to satisfy the Earnout Employee Condition will not be retained by
Parent even if there are no remaining Eligible Earnout Employees as of the
close of business on the last Business Day of the applicable Earnout Period,
in which case, amounts forfeited by Eligible Earnout Employees as provided in
Section 1.2(c) of these Earnout Provisions will first be reallocated among the
remaining Eligible Earnout Employees and, in the absence of any remaining
Eligible Earnout Employees, will be reallocated to the other Holders.

Section 1.6 Earnout Rights Not Transferable. No Holder may sell, exchange,
transfer or otherwise dispose of his, her or its right to receive any portion
of the Earnout Consideration without Parent's prior written consent (which may
be withheld in Parent's absolute discretion), other than by the laws of
descent and distribution or succession by will, legal representative upon
incompetence or for bona fide estate planning purposes, pursuant to a divorce
or separation agreement or a divorce decree or in connection with bankruptcy,
and any transfer in violation of this Section 1.6 will be null and void and
will not be recognized by Parent or the Surviving Company; provided, any
Holder that is an entity may distribute its rights under this Annex A to its
partners, members or other owners, pro rata in accordance with their ownership
interests in such entity; provided further that such rights so distributed
will not be further transferred except in accordance with this Section 1.6.

Section 1.7 Limited Duties of Parent. Notwithstanding anything in these
Earnout Provisions, none of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
Affiliates (i) will be under any obligation or have any duty to act in such a
manner that any Earnout Amounts are paid or, if payable, maximized, (ii) will
owe any Holder any fiduciary duty or other similar duty in respect of these
Earnout Provisions, or (iii) will have any obligation or be bound by any
agreement or covenant of any kind in respect of these Earnout Provisions,
other, in each case, than an obligation to comply 

with (x) the covenants and agreements expressly set forth in these Earnout
Provisions and (y) the covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in all
contracts governed by Delaware Law, it being the parties' intention that any
and all other obligations of Parent or its Affiliates relating to these
Earnout Provisions (whether implied or otherwise) are expressly waived and
disclaimed. The parties expressly acknowledge that (1) Parent and its
Affiliates currently operate a business including the provision of prepaid
debit card products and prepaid card reloading services in the United States
as well as mobile banking services, (2) Parent intends to continue operating
its existing business and may acquire and/or develop other businesses in the
future (including businesses that may be competitive with the Surviving
Company it being understood that any such acquisition will be made through the
Surviving Company), and (3) such actions will not be deemed to interfere with
or impede the ability of the Holders to achieve or maximize the Earnout
Consideration, but such actions may result in adjustments to the Earnout
EBITDA Target or the calculation of Earnout EBITDA to the extent expressly
provided in these Earnout Provisions.

Section 1.8 Clawback for Fraud or Intentional Misconduct. If, prior to April
30 of the calendar year following the year in which the last day of an Earnout
Period falls (i.e., April 30, 2016 for the 2015 Earnout Period, April 30, 2017
for the 2016 Earnout Period, and April 30, 2018 for the 2017 Earnout Period),
it is determined from Parent's audited financial statements and the related
audit process that (a) the Surviving Company's calculation of such Earnout
Amount was based on calculations of Earnout EBITDA and EBITDA that were
inaccurate at the time the applicable Earnout Amount is made and (b) such
inaccuracy is determined by a panel of three arbitrators to be attributable to
fraud or intentional misconduct of any employee of the Surviving Company or
its Subsidiaries, then the Earnout Amount for the Earnout Periods will be
recalculated using corrected information and Parent promptly will furnish the
Holder Representative with all material information known to Parent regarding
such inaccuracy, fraud and intentional misconduct. Parent will meet with the
Holder Representative and arrange for its outside auditors to meet with the
Holder Representative to explain the circumstances of such inaccuracy, fraud
or intentional misconduct in detail and answer the Holder Representative's
reasonable questions. If the recalculated amount of the Earnout Amount is less
than the amount on which actual payments hereunder were made, each Holder will
return to Parent its Pro Rata Percentage of any excess Earnout Amounts that
were paid. If the parties do not agree on the recalculation of such Earnout
Amount, the parties shall resolve such disagreement in accordance with Section
1.9.

Section 1.9 Dispute Resolution.

(a) Disputes relating solely to accounting and computational matters will be
resolved pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 2.14(b)-(c) of the
Agreement, mutatis mutandis.

(b) All disputes under these Earnout Provisions not covered by Section 1.9(a)
(including what constitutes TPG Requirements, TPG Requirement Expenses, Parent
Laws and Parent Allocable Item for purposes of determining any adjustment
thereunder) not resolved by the parties will be adjudicated pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 10.11 of the Agreement, mutatis mutandis.

will not be taken into account for any purpose in computing the Earnout EBITDA
or Earnout Coefficient for another Earnout Period.

"Earnout EBITDA" means EBITDA of the Company and its Subsidiaries recorded in
respect of an Earnout Period, subject to upward or downward adjustment solely
as follows:

(iii) Key Employee Changes. If there is a Key Employee Change that would, but
for this clause (i), result in an increase to Earnout EBITDA (e.g., any
reduction or elimination of salary or bonus expense as a result of the
termination of employment of a Key Employee), such Key Employee Change will be
disregarded for purposes of calculating Earnout EBITDA (i.e., Earnout EBITDA
will be calculated as if no Key Employee Change had occurred and such Key
Employee continued to be paid his salary and bonus for the duration of the
Earnout Period as contemplated by the Key Employee Assumptions); provided,
that if a Key Employee's employment is terminated in connection with a Key
Employee Change and the Surviving Company hires a new employee to perform the
duties and responsibilities of the terminated Key Employee, the salary and
bonus of such new employee will only be included as an expense in the
calculation of Earnout EBITDA to the extent such expense exceeds in the
aggregate the salary and bonus expense of such Key Employee which is set forth
on Schedule 1.10.

(iv) Adjustments for Make-Whole Payments. As part of each Earnout Statement
delivered to the TPG CEO, Parent will also deliver to the TPG CEO (and the TPG
CEO will deliver to the Holder Representative) a certificate (as to each
Earnout Period, its "Supplemental Earnout Certificate") setting forth in
reasonable detail Parent's good faith estimate as to (A) each item that has
reduced Earnout EBITDA for such Earnout Period and that is also an item within
the scope of the indemnification protection of Section 8.2 of the Agreement
(whether or not an indemnification claim has been made with respect to such
item) (each, an "Indemnifiable Loss"), (B) the portion (if any) of such
Indemnifiable Loss that has been paid in cash by a Parent Indemnified Party,
the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary (as to each such item, its "Cash Pay
Amount") and (C) the portion (if any) of such Indemnifiable Loss that remains
accrued as of the end of such Earnout Period (as to each such item, its
"Accrued Amount"). If, in the TPG CEO's good faith determination, the
Supplemental Earnout Certificate omitted any Indemnifiable Losses for such
Earnout Period, within 15 Business Days after Parent issues a Supplemental
Earnout Certificate, the TPG CEO may provide written notice to Parent with a
copy to the Holder Representative (a "Supplemental Earnout Certificate
Adjustment Notice") identifying any additional Indemnifiable Losses that the
TPG CEO 

believes should have been included for such Earnout Period, specifying in
reasonable detail any such Indemnifiable Losses and attaching reasonable
backup documentation for such additional Indemnifiable Losses. If the TPG CEO
does not deliver a Supplemental Earnout Certificate Adjustment Notice within
such 15 Business Day period, such Supplemental Earnout Certificate will be
deemed approved by the TPG CEO and the Indemnifiable Losses specified therein,
if any, will be the only Indemnifiable Losses subject to the adjustment
provisions of this paragraph for such Earnout Period. If the TPG CEO does
deliver a Supplemental Earnout Certificate Adjustment Notice within such 15
Business Day period, then the Parent CEO, TPG CEO and the Holder
Representative will promptly meet and confer regarding such Supplemental
Earnout Certificate and the Indemnifiable Losses identified therein. The
Parent CEO, TPG CEO and the Holder Representative will endeavor in good faith
within 15 days after the date of the Supplemental Earnout Certificate
Adjustment Notice to reach agreement regarding the proper amount of
Indemnifiable Losses applicable to such Earnout Period. In the event the
Parent CEO, TPG CEO and the Holder Representative are unable to resolve any
such disputes within such 15-day period, then Parent and the Holder
Representative will mutually agree on one mediator not affiliated with either
party to assist in resolving such disputes. Parent and the Holder
Representative will cooperate with one another in selecting a mediator and in
scheduling mediation proceedings, will act in good faith in such mediation,
will share equally in the costs of any such mediation, and will use good faith
efforts to cause such mediation to be completed within 60 days after the date
on which the TPG CEO delivered its Supplemental Earnout Certificate Adjustment
Notice. If a resolution is not agreed upon after completion of such mediation,
Parent and the Holder Representative will resolve such disagreement in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 1.9 of this Annex A. The
Holder Representative will have the right, exercisable in its sole discretion
within 30 days after final resolution of the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss
for such Earnout Period to elect to make Parent whole with respect to such
Indemnifiable Loss. If the Holder Representative elects to make Parent whole
with respect to any Indemnifiable Loss (each, a "Make Whole Loss"), the Holder
Representative will: (1) with respect to the Cash Pay Amount of such
Indemnifiable Loss, instruct the Escrow Agent in writing to release such
amount from the Escrow Amount to Parent or, once the remaining portion of the
Escrow Amount (minus the amount of all then pending but unresolved indemnity
claims) has been reduced to $0, agree in writing to allow the then pending
Earnout Payment or any subsequent Earnout Payment to be reduced by the portion
of the Cash Pay Amount not satisfied from a release of the Escrow Amount and
(2) with respect to the Accrued Amount of such Indemnifiable Loss, instruct
the Escrow Agent in writing to release such amount from the Escrow Amount or,
once the remaining portion of the Escrow Amount (minus the amount of all then
pending but unresolved indemnity claims) has been reduced to $0, agree in
writing to allow the then pending Earnout Payment or any subsequent Earnout
Payment to be reduced by the portion of the Accrued Amount not satisfied from
a release of the Escrow Amount; provided, the amounts released from escrow or
offset from any Earnout Payment under this clause (2) will be deposited into a
separate escrow account with the Escrow Agent (as to each Indemnifiable Loss,
its "Make Whole Escrow Amount") until the Accrued Amount of such Indemnifiable
Loss is resolved by Parent in accordance with the Agreement, at which time a
portion of the Make Whole Escrow Amount equal to the cash amount paid by
Parent, the Surviving Company or any Subsidiary to resolve such Accrued Amount
will be released to Parent and the balance will be released to the Holder
Representative for the benefit of the Holders. The Earnout EBITDA for any
Earnout Period will be increased by any Make Whole Payment of any Make Whole
Loss that reduced EBITDA for 

such Earnout Period. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing contained in this
paragraph shall alter or prejudice in any respect any Parent Indemnified
Party's rights to receive indemnification under Section 8.2 of the Agreement
(pursuant to the procedures and mechanisms set forth in Article VIII) with
respect to any matter or any Losses (whether or not related to an
Indemnifiable Loss identified in a Supplemental Earnout Certificate) that is
not finally determined to be an Indemnifiable Loss with respect to the
applicable Earnout Period pursuant to the foregoing procedures, including,
without limitation, with respect to any matter or Loss that may not be known,
determined or determinable as of the time of the preparation of the applicable
Supplemental Earnout Certificate or as to which Parent or the TPG CEO has not
yet determined a Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.2 of the Agreement as of the time of the preparation of
the applicable Supplemental Earnout Certificate.
