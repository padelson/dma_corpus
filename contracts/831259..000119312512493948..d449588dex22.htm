_CONVERSION OF SHARES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES _

Section 2.1 _Conversion of Shares_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub or the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or shares of common stock of Merger Sub:

 



\- 3 -  (i) _Common Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, be converted into one fully paid and
nonassessable share of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
or held in treasury by the Company and each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned
by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as defined
herein) (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any shares acquired by Parent
or any Subsidiary of Parent pursuant to the transactions contemplated by the
Pennsylvania Merger Agreement) shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist (the " _Cancelled Shares_
"), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor;  _provided_
, _however_ , that any shares of Company Common Stock owned or held by any
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as set forth below.
For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_ shall not apply to
shares of Company Common Stock held in trust or otherwise set aside from
shares held in the CompanyÂ’s treasury pursuant to or in respect of a Company
Benefit Plan. 

(iii) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the other provisions of
_ARTICLE II_ , each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Cancelled Shares or
Dissenting Shares (as defined herein), shall be converted automatically into
and shall thereafter represent the right to receive $14.75 in cash, without
interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") and (2) 1.15 Royalty Trust Units (the
" _Unit Consideration_ " and together with the Cash Consideration, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as
of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock
represented by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional Royalty Trust Units into which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have been converted
pursuant to this _Section 2.1_.

 

(b) _Shares of Dissenting Stockholders_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, any issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock held by a person (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") who has not
voted in favor of, or consented to, the adoption of this Agreement and has
complied with the provisions of the DGCL concerning the right of holders of
shares of Company Common Stock to require appraisal of their shares (the "
_Appraisal Provisions_ ") of Company Common Stock (" _Dissenting Shares_ "),
to the extent the Appraisal Provisions are applicable, shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger

 



\- 4 -   Consideration, but shall become the right to receive such consideration as
may be determined to be due to such Dissenting Stockholder pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL. If such Dissenting
Stockholder effectively withdraws its demand for appraisal or fails to perfect
or otherwise loses its right of appraisal, in any case pursuant to the DGCL,
each of such Dissenting StockholderÂ’s shares of Company Common Stock shall
thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands for appraisal of shares of Company
Common Stock received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect thereto. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands.

(c) _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (and as permitted by _ARTICLE V_ ), the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of
shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event
shall have occurred, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted, without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; provided
that nothing in this _Section 2.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

(d) _Company Convertible Securities_. The Company Convertible Securities
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding unless converted prior to the Effective Time, and shall
be treated in accordance with the respective terms of their underlying
agreements following the Effective Time; _provided_ , however, that the
Company Convertible Securities that are owned by Parent and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist
at the Effective Time, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

Section 2.2  _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company
to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the payment of the
Merger Consideration and shall enter into an agreement (the " _Exchange Agent
Agreement_ ") relating to the Exchange AgentÂ’s responsibilities under this
Agreement.

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates Representing Company Common Stock_.

(a) _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent cash sufficient to pay the
aggregate Cash Consideration (together with, to the extent then determinable,
the aggregate amount payable in lieu of fractional Royalty Trust Units
pursuant to Section 2.3(j)) for the payment to holders of Company Common Stock
and shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
evidence of Royalty Trust Units in book-entry form (and/or certificates
representing such Royalty Trust Units, at ParentÂ’s election) representing the
number of Royalty Trust Units 

 



\- 5 -   sufficient to deliver the aggregate Unit Consideration (such cash and
certificates, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and in any event within four (4) business days of the Closing
Date, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record
of shares of Company Common Stock whose shares of Company Common Stock were
converted pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)(iii)_ into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and
shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree upon prior to the Effective Time) (the " _Letter of
Transmittal_ ") and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

(c) _Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares_. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with the
Letter of Transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may customarily be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional Royalty Trust Units into
which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of shares of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer or stock records of the Company, any cash to be paid upon, or
Royalty Trust Units to be issued upon, due surrender of the Certificate or
Book-Entry Share formerly representing such shares of Company Common Stock may
be paid or issued, as the case may be, to such a transferee if such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer or other similar Taxes have
been paid or are not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on
the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.3_, each Certificate and Book-
Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration and
any cash in lieu of fractional Royalty Trust Units into which the shares
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. From and after the
Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of Company other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
into which the shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_, without
interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
with respect to all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing shares of

 



\- 6 -   Company Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _ARTICLE II_ , subject
to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
holders of Certificates or Book- Entry Shares pursuant to this _ARTICLE II_ ,
and following any losses from any such investment, Parent shall promptly
provide additional funds to the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time in the amount of such
losses, which additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund.
Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent, upon demand.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other amounts received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed to, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this _ARTICLE II_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent or the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Merger Consideration and any cash
in lieu of fractional Royalty Trust Units without any interest thereon.

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any portion of the Exchange
Fund or the Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, any portion of the Merger Consideration
or the cash to be paid in accordance with this _ARTICLE II_ that remains

permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the

deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under applicable Tax Law. Any amounts so deducted, withheld and paid over to
the appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by

determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent (or, if subsequent to the termination of the
Exchange Fund and subject to _Section 2.3(g)_, Parent) shall deliver, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the

to receive a fraction of a Royalty Trust Unit (after taking into account all
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such fractional
amount multiplied by the average closing price of one Royalty Trust Unit on
the stock exchange on which the Royalty Trust Units are listed (as reported in

(each, an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions
as were applicable to such Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock, rounded down to
the nearest whole share, determined by multiplying the number of Shares

Equity Award Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common
Stock, rounded up to the nearest whole cent, equal to the per share exercise
price for the Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to the Company Option
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the
Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

(b) Each award of restricted stock units in respect of Shares granted under a
Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") that is outstanding as of the

by multiplying the number of Shares subject to the Company RSU outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Equity Award Exchange Ratio,

conditions as were applicable to the related Company RSU outstanding or
payable immediately prior to the Effective Time.

contingent or accrued, to receive Shares or cash payments measured by the
value of a number of Shares granted under a Company Deferred Compensation
Plan (each, an " _Other Stock-Based Award_ ") that are outstanding immediately

Effective Time into the right to receive (or to be credited with) the number

Exchange Ratio (each, an " _Adjusted Other Stock-Based Award_ "), with each
Adjusted Other Stock-Based Award to continue to be subject to the same terms

committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for the treatment of the
Company Options, Company RSUs, and Other Stock-Based Awards (collectively,
the " _Company Stock Awards_ ") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time as contemplated by this _Section 2.4_. For the avoidance of doubt, in no
event shall any holder of a Company Stock Award receive the Merger
Consideration as consideration for such Company Stock Awards. As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall file one or more appropriate registration
statements (on Form S-3 or Form S-8, or any successor or other appropriate
forms) with respect to Parent Common Stock underlying the Adjusted Options
and in respect of the Adjusted RSUs and the Adjusted Other Stock-Based Awards
pursuant to this _Section 2.4_.

 

(e) For the purposes of this _Section 2.4_:

 

(i) " _Company Closing Price_ " shall mean the average, rounded to the nearest
one hundredth of a cent, of the closing sales prices of shares of Company

further instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary
or desirable to consummate the Merger or to

Effective Time, then Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Surviving

results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods then ended, (ii) were prepared in conformity with U.S.

13a-15 under the Exchange Act, except where the failure to maintain such
controls and procedures has not had, and would not have, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The CompanyÂ’s disclosure controls and procedures are
reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time

material information is accumulated and communicated to the CompanyÂ’s
management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302

assessment of the effectiveness of the CompanyÂ’s internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2011, and such assessment
concluded that such controls were effective. Based on its most recent

report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
CompanyÂ’s internal control over financial reporting.

obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued,
absolute, determined or contingent that would have been required to be
reflected in, reserved against or otherwise described on the Company Financial
Statements (or in the notes thereto) in accordance with GAAP and were not

available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) liabilities or
obligations incurred in accordance with or in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated or permitted by this Agreement, and (iii)
liabilities or obligations that have not had and would not have, individually

default under or in violation of, any applicable federal, state, local or
foreign law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, Order,

compliance, default or violation have not had and would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(g) There are no pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
claims (other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or

knowledge, no set of circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to
a claim or lawsuit, against the Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries
thereof or the Company, in each case, with respect to their duties to the
Company Benefits Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Company Benefit Plans which could reasonably be expected to be material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



\- 19 -  (h) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates has been involved in any transaction that would reasonably be

Time, Parent or any of its Affiliates to be subject to material liability
under Section 4069 of ERISA. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred (either directly or indirectly, including as a result of any
indemnification obligation) any liability under or pursuant to Title I of
ERISA with respect to any Company Benefit Plan which remains outstanding and
unsatisfied, except as has not had and would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and, to the knowledge of the
Company, no event, transaction or condition has occurred or exists that
would reasonably be expected to result in any such liability to the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries, or, after the Effective Time, Parent or any of its
Affiliates, except as has not had and would not have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 3.9(i)_ of the Company Disclosure

beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of
the Code.

(j) Each Company Benefit Plan that is or was a nonqualified deferred

and applicable guidance thereunder and since January 1, 2009 has been in
documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code, except
as has not had and would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No assets set aside for the payment of
benefits under any Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan are held outside of
the United States, except to the extent that substantially all of the
services to which such benefits are attributable have been performed in the
jurisdiction in which such assets are held. The Company is not party to, or
otherwise obligated under, any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that
provides for the gross-up of taxes imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the
Code.

(k) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
not, either alone or in combination with another event (i) entitle any current
or former employee, director, consultant or officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to severance pay, or accrued pension benefit or any other
material payment, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation due any such employee, director, consultant or

or (iv) result in any payment (whether in cash or property or the vesting of
property) to any "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) that would be reasonably likely to,
individually or in combination with any other such payment, constitute an
"excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No
Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes
under Section 4999 of the Code.

limit in any material respect Parent,

 



\- 38 -   the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates
from engaging in any business or competing in any geographic location with any
person, except (i) in case of an emergency that, in the CompanyÂ’s good faith

Section 5.2 _Access_.

(a) For purposes of furthering the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to afford Parent and (i) the
officers and employees and (ii) the accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
financial advisors (including the employees, consultants and Representatives
thereof), financing sources and agents and other representatives of Parent
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice from Parent, throughout the period prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the Termination Date, to its and its SubsidiariesÂ’
personnel and properties, contracts, commitments, books and records and any
report, schedule or other document filed or received by it pursuant to the
requirements of applicable Laws and with such additional accounting,
financing, operating, environmental and other data and information regarding
the Company and its Subsidiaries, as Parent may reasonably request for the
purpose of facilitating the consummation of the Financing and the Merger.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to afford

 



\- 39 -   such access if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any Contract to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a risk of a
loss of privilege to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or would
constitute a violation of any applicable Law. Neither Parent nor any of its
officers, employees or representatives, shall be permitted to perform
any onsite procedures (including an onsite study) with respect to any
property of the Company or any of the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries without the
CompanyÂ’s prior written consent.

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective officers, directors, employees or representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement, dated as of July 11, 2012, between the Company and Parent (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

Section 5.3 _Non-Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_, the Company shall,
shall cause each of its Affiliates and its and their respective officers,
directors and employees to, and shall direct the agents, financial advisors,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or any of its Affiliates
to: (A) immediately cease any ongoing solicitation, knowing encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect
to a Company Takeover Proposal, and promptly instruct (to the extent it
has contractual authority to do so and has not already done so prior to the
date of this Agreement) or otherwise request, any person that has executed a
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement within the 24-month period prior
to the date of this Agreement in connection with any actual or potential
Company Takeover Proposal to return or destroy all such information or
documents or material incorporating confidential information in the possession
of such person or its Representatives and (B) until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the Termination Date, not, directly or indirectly, (1) solicit,
initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information) any inquiries regarding, or the making of
any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal, (2) engage in, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
other person any non-public information in connection with or for the purpose
of encouraging or facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal (other than,
solely in response to an unsolicited inquiry, to refer the inquiring person to
this  _Section 5.3_ and to limit its conversation or other communication
exclusively to such referral), or (3) approve, recommend or enter into, or
propose to approve, recommend or enter into, any letter of intent or similar
document, agreement, commitment, or agreement in principle (whether written
or oral, binding or nonbinding) with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal.
Except to the extent necessary to take any actions that the Company or any
third party would otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to this _Section
5.3_ (and in such case only in accordance with the terms hereof) or with
respect to the Standstill Waivers, (A) the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
not release any third party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of,
or grant permission under, (1) any standstill provision in any agreement to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (2) any
confidentiality provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party other than, with respect to this clause (2), any
waiver, amendment, modification or permission under a

 



\- 40 -   confidentiality provision that does not, and would not be reasonably likely
to, facilitate, encourage or relate in any way to a Company Takeover Proposal
or a potential Company Takeover Proposal and (B) the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to (1)
enforce the confidentiality and standstill provisions of any such agreement,
and (2) immediately take all steps within their power necessary to terminate
any waiver that may have been heretofore granted, to any person other than
Parent or any of ParentÂ’s Affiliates, under any such provisions.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, directly or
indirectly receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover Proposal
from any person that did not result from the CompanyÂ’s, its AffiliatesÂ’ or
the CompanyÂ’s or its AffiliatesÂ’ Representatives breach of _Section 5.3_ and
if the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special
Committee if then in existence or otherwise by a majority of its Independent
Directors, determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Company Superior Proposal, then the Company may, directly or indirectly, (A)
furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, information
(including non-public information) with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties, assets,
employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to the person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal and
its Representatives and potential sources of financing; provided, that the
Company shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or
its Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously
provided or made available to Parent and (B) engage in or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations with the person making such Company
Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and potential sources of financing
regarding such Company Takeover Proposal (including, as a part thereof, making
counterproposals). " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any
customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less
favorable to the Company than those applicable to Parent that are contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that such confidentiality agreement
(x) shall not prohibit compliance by the Company with any of the provisions
of this _Section 5.3_ and (y) may contain a less restrictive standstill
restriction.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) notify, orally and in writing, Parent after receipt by the Company or
any of its Representatives of any Company Takeover Proposal, including of the
identity of the person making the Company Takeover Proposal and the material
terms and conditions thereof, and shall promptly (and in no event later than
24 hours after receipt) provide copies to Parent of any written proposals,
indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such Company
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a
prompt basis, as to the status of (including changes to any material terms of,
and any other material developments with respect to) such Company Takeover
Proposal (including by promptly (and in no event later than 24 hours after
receipt) providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised written
proposals, indications of interest, and/or draft agreements relating to such
Company Takeover Proposal). The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries
will not enter into any agreement with any person subsequent to the date of
this Agreement 

 



\- 41 -   which prohibits the Company from providing any information to Parent in
accordance with this _Section 5.3_.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3(d)_ and, with respect
to (i)(A) and (i)(B) of this sentence only, _Section 5.3(e)_, the Company
Board shall not (i) (A) fail to include the Company Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, (B) change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or
authorize or publicly propose to change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or
modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (C) take
any formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection
with a tender offer or exchange offer (other than a recommendation against
such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) (it being understood
that the Company Board may refrain from taking a position with respect to such
a tender offer or exchange offer until the close of business as of the tenth
business day after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange offer
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action being
considered a Company Adverse Recommendation Change) or (D) adopt, approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend to stockholders
of the Company a Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_
"), or (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to enter into any letter of intent, agreement, commitment or agreement in
principle with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 5.3(b)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, prior to the time the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
Company Board may, acting upon the recommendation of the Company Special
Committee if then in existence or otherwise by a majority of its Independent
Directors make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if, after receiving a
bona fide, unsolicited Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a
breach of _Section 5.3_, the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of
the Company Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise by a majority
of its Independent Directors, has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that (i) such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company Superior
Proposal and (ii) in light of such Company Takeover Proposal, the failure to
take such action would be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; provided, however, that, prior to making such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has given Parent at
least four (4) business daysÂ’ prior written notice of its intention to take
such action (which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of
any such Company Superior Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided
to Parent a copy of the Company Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed
transaction agreements with the person making such Company Superior Proposal
and a copy of any financing commitments relating thereto (or, if not provided
in writing to the Company, a written summary of the material terms thereof),
(B) the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to
negotiate, in good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent
Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the
terms of this Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C) following
the end of such notice period, the Company Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee if then in existence or
otherwise by a majority of its Independent Directors, shall have considered in
good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside

 



\- 42 -   financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior
Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal
if the revisions proposed by Parent were to be given effect, and (D) in the
event of any change to any of the financial terms (including the form, amount
and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material terms of such
Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to
Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above
of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall
commence (except that the four (4) business day period notice period referred
to in clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of
(1) two business days and (2) the period remaining under the notice period
under clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such
additional notice under this clause (D)) during which time the Company shall
be required to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(d)_ anew
with respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D)
above of this proviso; and provided, further, that the Company has complied in
all material respect with its obligations under this _Section 5.3_.

 

(e) Other than in connection with a Company Superior Proposal (which shall be
subject to _Section 5.3(d)_ and shall not be subject to this _Section
5.3(e)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company
Board from making a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company Board, acting upon the recommendation of the
Company Special Committee if then in existence or otherwise by a majority of
its Independent Directors, has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company Board to make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making such Company
Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has given Parent at least four
(4) business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action,
which notice shall specify the reasons therefor, (B) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent during such notice period after giving any such notice, to the
extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to
the terms of this Agreement such that it would not permit the Company Board
to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section
5.3(e)_, (C) following the end of such notice period, the Company Board shall
have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening
Event would be inconsistent with the Company BoardÂ’s fiduciary duties under
applicable Law and (D) in the event of each and every change to the material
facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event, the Company
shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent
with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and a new notice
period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence (except that the
four (4) business day notice period referred to in clause (A) above of this
proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (1) two business days and (2)
the period remaining under the notice period under clause (A) of this proviso
immediately prior to the delivery of such additional notice under this clause
(D)), during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the
requirements of this _Section 5.3(e)_ anew with respect to such
additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.

 



\- 43 -  (f) Nothing contained in this _Section 5.3_ shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the
Company a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen"
communication or any other similar disclosure to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act if, in the
determination in good faith of the Company Board, acting upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee if then in existence or
otherwise by a majority of its Independent Directors, after consultation with
outside counsel, the failure so to disclose would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties under applicable Law or obligations
under applicable federal securities Law of the Company Board; provided, that
any such position or disclosure (other than any "stop, look and listen"
communication that includes a reaffirmation of the Company Recommendation)
shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change unless the
Company Board expressly and concurrently reaffirms the Company Recommendation.

 

Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the preliminary
Proxy Statement, Parent shall, and shall cause the Trust to, prepare and file
with the SEC the Form S-4 and the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and
file the Schedule 13E-3 with the SEC, and the Company and Parent shall
cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the
foregoing. Parent shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, including by
providing the Company with any information regarding Parent or Merger Sub that
is reasonably required to be included in the Proxy Statement or the Schedule
13E-3. The Company shall reasonably cooperate with Parent and the Trust in the
preparation of the Form S-4, including by providing Parent and the Trust with
any information regarding the Company or its properties or assets that is
reasonably requested by Parent and required to be included in the Form S-4.
The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments
of the SEC or its staff, to clear the preliminary Proxy Statement and
the Schedule 13E-3 with the SEC as promptly as practicable after filing and
to cause the Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3 to be mailed to the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders as promptly as practicable after responding to all such comments
to the satisfaction of the SEC (or as otherwise directed by Parent with
respect to coordinating with the mailing of the Form S-4). Parent and the
Trust shall use their reasonable best efforts to respond to any comments of
the SEC or its staff, to have the Form S-4 declared effective by the SEC as
promptly as practicable after filing, and to cause the Form S-4 to be mailed
to the CompanyÂ’s stockholders as promptly as practicable after it is declared
effective. Each of the Company and Parent will advise the other party,
promptly after it receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3
or the Form S-4, as applicable, or comments thereon or responses thereto or
requests by the SEC or its staff for additional information. The Company will
promptly provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company
(or its Representatives) and the SEC (or its staff) regarding the Proxy
Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or the Merger. No filing of, or amendment or
supplement to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 will be made by the Company, without
providing Parent and Merger Sub a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon (and the Company shall give reasonable

 



\- 44 -   consideration to all reasonable comments suggested by Parent, Merger Sub or
their counsel). If at any time prior to the Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting
there shall occur any event that is required to be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, the Company shall
as promptly as reasonably practicable prepare and mail to its stockholders
such an amendment or supplement.

 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the Proxy
Statement and the Schedule 13E-3 by the SEC and the declaration of
effectiveness of the Form S-4, the Company shall take all action necessary in
accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational Documents to
duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders
(including any postponement or adjournment thereof) for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Company Stockholders Â’
Meeting_"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting without ParentÂ’s consent; provided that without ParentÂ’s
consent, the Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
after consultation with Parent (i) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement, Form S-4 or Schedule
13E-3 is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a reasonable
amount of time in advance of the Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting or (ii) if as
of the time for which the Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting is originally
scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares
of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company
StockholdersÂ’ Meeting or to solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of
adoption of this Agreement if sufficient votes to constitute the
Company Stockholder Approval have not been obtained. Subject to making a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company Board shall recommend the
adoption of this Agreement and shall take all lawful action to solicit such
adoption of this Agreement. In the event that subsequent to the date hereof,
the Company Board determines to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
the Company shall nevertheless submit this Agreement to the holders of the
Company Common Stock for adoption at the Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting and
take all other action necessary or advisable to solicit the vote or consent of
its stockholders required by the rules of the NYSE or applicable law, and
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Company Takeover
Proposal other than the Merger unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated in accordance with its terms prior to such meeting.

(c) At the Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting or any postponement or adjournment
thereof, Parent and Merger Sub shall vote, or cause to be voted, all of the
shares of Company Common Stock then beneficially owned by either of them or
any of their Subsidiaries and controlled affiliates in favor of the adoption
of this Agreement.

(d) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent will cause the Trust to prepare and file with the SEC a
shelf registration statement on any appropriate form under the Securities Act
(the " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ") relating to the transfer of Royalty
Trust Units to holders of Company Convertible Securities upon conversion of
such holdersÂ’ Company Convertible Securities. Parent shall reasonably
cooperate with the Trust in the preparation of the Shelf Registration
Statement, including by providing the Trust with any information regarding
Parent, the Company or their respective properties or assets that is
reasonably requested by Parent and required to be included in the Shelf
Registration

 



\- 45 -   Statement. Parent and the Trust shall use their reasonable best efforts to
respond to any comments of the SEC or its staff, to have the Shelf
Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC as promptly as
practicable after filing but in no event later than the Effective Time, and to
cause the Shelf Registration Statement to remain continuously effective until
the earlier of (i) the conversion, exchange, repurchase or redemption of all
Company Convertible Securities or (ii) the maturity of each series of Company
Convertible Securities.

 

Section 5.5 _Employee Matters_.

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and for a period of one year
thereafter, Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, to employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries who continue to be
employed by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") for so
long as the applicable Company Employee remains employed by Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, compensation and benefits that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the compensation and benefits paid and provided
to similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries); provided, that for purposes of the foregoing
sentence the Company Benefit Plans provided to employees of the Company as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain in place and be deemed to
be substantially comparable, on an aggregate basis, to those provided to
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries for purposes of
this sentence, it being understood that the Company Employees may commence
participation in ParentÂ’s benefit plans on different dates following the
Effective Time with respect to different benefit plans.

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the Company
Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing
Date (collectively, the "Post-Closing Plans") to recognize the service of
each Company Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries and all of their
respective predecessor entities prior to the Closing Date for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual rates or contribution rates under
such Post-Closing Plans, in each case, to the same extent such service was
recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee was eligible to participate
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided that such recognition of
service shall not (i) apply for benefit accrual purposes of any defined
benefit retirement plan or plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii)
operate to duplicate any benefits of a Company Employee with respect to the
same period of service, (iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or
arrangement (x) under which similarly-situated employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries do not receive credit for prior service or (y) that is
grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or
participation. With respect to any Post-Closing Plan that provides medical,
dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such Company
Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use reasonable best
efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility
waiting periods under such plan to be waived with respect to such Company
Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied
under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) credit each Company Employee
for an amount equal to any medical, dental or vision expenses incurred by such
Company Employee in the year that includes the

 



\- 46 -   Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate in such Post-Closing Plan) for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such Post-Closing Plan to the extent such expenses would have been credited
under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
applicable information being provided to Parent. Such credited expenses shall
also count toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or visit limits or
similar limitations that apply under the terms of the applicable plan.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
following the Effective Time, while employed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, the Company Employees whose employment is governed by a
Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be provided compensation and benefits
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Collective Bargaining Agreement as in
effect from time to time.

(d) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) business days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate, subject to the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, the McMoRan
Exploration Co. Employee Capital Accumulation Program (the " _Company 401(k)
Plan_ "). Following the Effective Time, the assets of the Company 401(k) Plan
shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall permit the Company
Employees who are then actively employed to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code) to ParentÂ’s 401(k) plan. Individual account balances shall be
valued as of the date of transfer, and the transfer shall be in cash, except
that outstanding loan balances shall be transferred in the form of notes or
other documentation evidencing such loans.

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, honor all accrued and vested benefits under the
Company Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time and applicable Law as such agreements and
arrangements may be modified or terminated in accordance with their terms
from time to time.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or
other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any affiliate of Parent, or shall
interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly
reserved, to discharge or terminate the services of any Company Employee at
any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall
the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any
Company Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement
maintained or sponsored by Parent, Surviving Corporation, the Company or any
of their Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, Company and its
Subsidiaries) or affiliates; or (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries (including, after the
Closing Date, Company and its Subsidiaries) or affiliates to amend, modify or
terminate any Company Benefit Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit
or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding

 



\- 47 -   any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _Section
5.5_ shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any Company Employee
or current or former service provider of the Company or its affiliates (or
any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

Section 5.6 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger including (i) the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations
and notices required to be filed to consummate the Merger, (ii) the
satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) taking all
reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other in
obtaining) any consent, authorization, Order or approval of, or any exemption
by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity (which actions shall
include furnishing all information and documentary material required under the
HSR Act) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger or the
taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) the execution
and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger
and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not take any action
after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any permission,
approval or consent from any such Governmental Entity necessary to be
obtained prior to Closing. To the extent that transfers of any permits issued
by any Governmental Entity are required as a result of the execution of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, the parties hereto shall use
reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken
pursuant to the provisions of this  _Section 5.6_. In that regard, prior to
the Closing, each party shall promptly consult with the other parties to this
Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information with respect to
(and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties (or their
counsel) copies of), all filings made by such party with any Governmental
Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or correspondence
with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger.
Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other parties to this
Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other party with copies of (or, in
the case of oral communications, advise the other party orally of) any
communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the Merger, and permit
the other party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith
the views of the other party in connection with, any proposed communication
with any such Governmental Entity. If any party to this Agreement or any
Representative of such parties receives a request for additional information
or documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger, then such party will use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to
be made, promptly and after consultation with the other parties to this
Agreement, an appropriate response in substantial compliance with such
request. Neither party shall participate in any meeting or 

 



\- 48 -   teleconference with any Governmental Entity where material issues would
likely be discussed in connection with this Agreement and the Merger unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat. Each party shall furnish the other party with copies of
all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and furnish the other party with
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or
submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that materials provided pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and
the Merger or other confidential information, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual arrangements, and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege concerns.

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten (10) business
days after the date of this Agreement, all notifications required under the
HSR Act. In the event that the parties receive a request for information or
documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second Request_ "), the
parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond to such
Second Request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for both parties will
closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second Request review
process.

(d) In furtherance, and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent shall (and
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause Pennsylvania to) take any and all
action necessary to obtain expiration or early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Pennsylvania Merger Agreement, including but not limited
to: (i) selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and agreeing to
sell or otherwise dispose of, assets, categories of assets or businesses of
the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (ii) terminating,
entering into or modifying existing relationships, contractual rights or
obligations of the Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries; (iii)
terminating any venture or other arrangement; or (iv) creating any
relationship, contractual rights or obligations of the Company or Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries (each a " _Divestiture Action_ ") in an effort
to ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment,
decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any law,
rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or permanently restraining,
enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Merger. Parent may condition
the entry of a Divestiture Action on consummation of the Merger. In the event
a Governmental Entity institutes (or threatens to institute) any action
challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
any U.S. antitrust law, Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use
reasonable best efforts to vigorously contest and resist any such Action, and
to have vacated, lifted, reversed, or overturned any decree, judgment,
injunction or other order whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that
is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, or restricts consummation of the
Merger, including by pursuing administrative or judicial appeal, and Parent
shall take all action necessary, including but not limited to any Divestiture
Action, in an effort to resolve such action so as to permit such consummation
prior to the End Date. To assist Parent in complying with its obligations set
forth in this Section, at ParentÂ’s request the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more agreements prior to the Closing
with respect to any

 



\- 49 -   Divestiture Action; provided, however, that the consummation of the
transactions provided for in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action shall
be conditioned upon the Closing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, nothing in this Section or elsewhere shall require, or be
deemed to require, Parent to take or agree to take any Divestiture Action if
doing so would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on
Parent.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
agree that it is ParentÂ’s sole right to devise the strategy for all filings,
notifications, submissions and communications in connection with any filing,
notice, petition, statement, registration, submission of information,
application or similar filing subject to this _Section 5.6_.

Section 5.7  _Takeover Statutes_. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably
necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.8 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party
shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that all press releases and other
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, to the
extent they have not been previously issued or disclosed, shall be consistent
with such joint communications plan. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, each party shall consult with each other before issuing
any press release or public statement with respect to the Merger and, subject
to the requirements of applicable Law or the rules of any securities exchange,
shall not issue any such press release or public statement prior to such
consultation. Parent and the Company agree to issue a mutually acceptable
initial joint press release announcing this Agreement.

Section 5.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former,
directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificate of incorporation or
bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement shall
survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. For a period
of six years from the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain in effect any and all exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provisions of the CompanyÂ’s and any of its
SubsidiariesÂ’ certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any
of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees in
effect immediately prior to the

 



\- 50 -   Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any such
provisions or the exculpation, indemnification or advancement of expenses
provisions of the Surviving CorporationÂ’s certificate of incorporation and
bylaws in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
individuals who immediately before the Effective Time were current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue
until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such claim. 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to), to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law,
indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing) each current and former director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each person who served as a
director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise if such service was at the request or for the benefit of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such personÂ’s heirs,
executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against
any costs or expenses (including advancing attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking consistent with the Company
Organizational Documents to repay such amounts if it is ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to indemnification), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (an "
_Action_ "), arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission by them in their capacities as such occurring or alleged to have
occurred whether before or after the Effective Time (including acts or
omissions in connection with such Indemnified Party serving as an officer,
director, employee or other fiduciary of any entity if such service was at
the request or for the benefit of the Company). In the event of any such
Action, the Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party
in the defense of any such Action. 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directorsÂ’
and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries or provide
substitute policies for the Company and its current and former directors and
officers who are currently covered by the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance coverage in effect as of the date
hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries, in either case, of not less than
the existing coverage and have other terms not less favorable to the insured
persons than the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance coverage with respect to matters existing or arising
on or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall
not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of the
coverages (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") required to be obtained pursuant hereto,
but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for
such amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company may,
prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with respect to acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to the

 



\- 51 -   Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by such
Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such; _provided_ that such "tail
policy" shall provide coverage in an amount not less than the existing
coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the Indemnified Parties
than the directorsÂ’ and officersÂ’ liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage in effect as of the date hereof by the Company and its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ further in no event shall the cost of such policy, if
purchased by the Company, exceed six (6) times the Maximum Amount and, if such
a "tail policy" is purchased, Parent shall have no further obligations under
this _Section 5.9(c)_. The Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies
in full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

 

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneysÂ’
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.9_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party shall be in addition to, and not in
limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation, any
other indemnification arrangement, the DGCL or otherwise.

(f) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this
_Section 5.9_ shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any manner so
as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party (including their successors,
heirs and legal representatives) to whom this  _Section 5.9_ applies without
the consent of such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the
contrary, (i) the Indemnified Parties to whom this  _Section 5.9_ applies
shall be third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.9_, and (ii) this
_Section 5.9_ shall survive consummation of the Merger and shall be
enforceable by such Indemnified Parties and their respective successors,
heirs and legal representatives against Parent and the Surviving Corporation
and their respective successors and assigns.

(g) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this _Section
5.9_.

Section 5.10  _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any
partyÂ’s rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and
agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
partyÂ’s operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

 



\- 52 -  Section 5.11 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
advisable or proper to arrange, and obtain the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letters by the Closing, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect each Commitment
Letter (provided that such Commitment Letters may be amended, supplemented,
modified and replaced as set forth below), (ii) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions applicable to Parent to the funding of the Financing set forth in
each Commitment Letters and within ParentÂ’s control (other than any condition
where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct result of the CompanyÂ’s
failure to furnish information to Parent) and (iii) negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letters (including any "flex" provisions), or
terms and conditions not materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to
Parent than the terms and conditions contemplated by each Commitment Letters
(including any "flex" provisions) which terms and conditions would not
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the
consummation of the Financing or the Merger. 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub
to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment, replacement, supplement or
other modification of, or waive any of its material rights under, any
Commitment Letter without the CompanyÂ’s prior written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ that
Parent and Merger Sub may, without the CompanyÂ’s prior written consent (x)
enter into any amendment, replacement, supplement or other modification to or
waiver of any provision of any Commitment Letter that does not contain any
provisions that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the Merger; and (y)
amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify any Commitment Letter (subject
to the terms and conditions thereof) to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities who had not executed such
Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement. Upon any such amendment,
replacement, supplement or modification, the term "Commitment Letters" shall
include any such Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
modified. For the avoidance of doubt, each of Parent and Merger Sub may, if it
so determines in its discretion, arrange for alternative financing for the
Merger from a third party or parties reasonably satisfactory to Parent (and
thereafter the "Commitment Letter" (as modified in singular form if the
context requires) and the "Financing" as defined herein shall refer to such
financing commitment in respect of such alternative financing) on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable to Parent (taken as a whole), if such
alternative financing does not contain any provisions that would reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation
of the Financing or the Merger. If any such alternate financing is obtained
Parent shall promptly and in any event within one Business Day provide the
Company with a copy of any new financing commitment (redacted for provisions
related to fees, pricing, "flex" terms, any other economic terms and other
confidential terms but not, for the avoidance of doubt, as to any matters
related to conditionality) that provides for such alternative financing.

(c) In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions described in or contemplated by the Commitment Letters
(including the "flex" provision) for any reason, or Parent and Merger Sub
determines in their discretion, to 

 



\- 53 -   arrange for alternative financing for the Merger from a third party or
parties reasonably satisfactory to Parent on terms and conditions not
materially less favorable to Parent (taken as a whole), provided that such
alternative financing does not contain any provisions that would reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of
the Merger, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and
obtain alternative financing from the same or alternative sources reasonably
satisfactory to Parent (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount
sufficient and on terms and conditions not materially less favorable
(taken as a whole) than those described in the Commitment Letters (which
terms and conditions would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially
delay or materially impede the consummation of the Financing or the Merger) to
enable Parent to fund the payment of the cash component of the aggregate
Merger Consideration (and thereafter the "Commitment Letters" and the
"Financing" as defined herein shall refer to such financing commitment for the
Alternative Financing). If an Alternative Financing is required in accordance
with this _Section 5.11_, Parent shall promptly, and in any event within one
Business Day provide the Company with a copy of any new financing commitment
(redacted for provisions related to fees, pricing, "flex" terms, any other
economic terms and other confidential terms but not, for the avoidance of
doubt, as to any matters related to conditionality) that provides for such
Alternative Financing, and thereafter the "Commitment Letters" (as modified
to singular form if the context requires) as defined herein shall refer to
such financing commitment in respect of the Alternative Financing.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives to (at the sole expense of
Parent), provide all cooperation that is usual and customary for similar
financings and otherwise as may be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
in connection with the Financing or any Alternative Financing by Parent or any
of its affiliates in connection with the Merger as may be reasonably
requested by Parent or its Representatives. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives to (i) furnish, as promptly as practicable, the
report of the CompanyÂ’s auditor on the most recently available audited
consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such auditor to the use
of such report in accordance with normal custom and practice and use
reasonable best efforts to cause such auditor to provide customary comfort
letters (which shall provide "negative assurance" comfort) to the
underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, as applicable, in
connection with any such Financing or Alternative Financing; (ii) furnish, as
promptly as practicable (A) any financial statements, schedules or other
financial data or information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries
reasonably requested by Parent or its Representatives as may be necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the Financing or the Alternative Financing,
including financial statements, financial data, audit reports and other
information of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K
promulgated under the Securities Act for a registered public offering or as
may be necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the offering(s) of debt
securities contemplated by the Commitment Letters, and (B) drafts of such
"comfort" letters which such independent accountants are prepared to issue
upon completion of customary procedures, each in form and substance customary
for offering(s) of debt securities contemplated by the Commitment Letters;
(iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate contact between (x)
senior management and advisors, including auditors, of the Company and (y)
the proposed lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, underwriters, initial
purchasers or placement agents, as applicable, and/or ParentÂ’s or any of its
affiliateÂ’s auditors in connection with, the 

 



\- 54 -   Financing or any Alternative Financing, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable advance notice; (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to make
available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice, the
necessary employees and advisors of the Company and its Subsidiaries to
provide reasonable assistance with the preparation of business projections,
financing documents and offer materials by Parent and its affiliates; (v)
provide customary information, documents, authorization letters and
certificates, enter into agreements and take other actions that are or may be
customary in connection with the Financing or any Alternative Financing

Section 7.1 _Termination or Abandonment_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated and abandoned at
any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after any approval of
the Merger by the stockholders of the Company:

 

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub duly
authorized (i) with respect to Parent and Merger Sub, by their respective
boards of directors or other governing body, and (ii) with respect to the
Company, by the Company Board upon the recommendation of the Company Special
Committee if then in existence or otherwise by a majority of the CompanyÂ’s
Independent Directors;

(b) by either the Company (duly authorized by the Company Board upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee if then in existence or
otherwise by a majority of the CompanyÂ’s Independent Directors) or Parent, if
the Merger shall not have been consummated on or prior to June 5, 2013 (the "
_End Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if all of the conditions to

to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)_ shall not be
available to a party if the failure of the Closing to occur by such date
shall be due to the material breach by such party of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement of such party set forth in this
Agreement.

(c) by either the Company (duly authorized by the Company Board upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee if then in existence or
otherwise by a majority of the CompanyÂ’s Independent Directors) or Parent, if
an injunction shall have been entered permanently restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the Merger and such injunction shall
have become final and nonappealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right

\- 59 -  (d) by either the Company (duly authorized by the Company Board upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee if then in existence or
otherwise by a majority of the CompanyÂ’s Independent Directors) or Parent, if

have been obtained;

(e) by the Company (duly authorized by the Company Board upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee if then in existence or
otherwise by a majority of the CompanyÂ’s Independent Directors), if Parent or
Merger Sub shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements contained in
this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (i) would result in a
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_
and (ii) by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such

in reasonable detail ( _provided_ that the Company is not then in breach of
any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein
such that a condition set forth in  _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_
would not be satisfied);

(f) by Parent, if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of

and (ii) by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the End Date or, if such
breach or failure is capable of being cured by the End Date, the Company does

reasonable detail ( _provided_ that Parent is not then in breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein such
that a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ would not
be satisfied); and

(g) by Parent prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval in the
event of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change.

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, this Agreement shall terminate (except
for the provisions of  _Section 7.3_ and _ARTICLE VIII_ ), and there shall

as provided in _Section 7.3_ and liability arising out of or the result of,
fraud or any willful or intentional breach of any covenant or agreement or
willful or intentional breach of any representation or warranty in this
Agreement occurring prior to termination or as provided for in the
Confidentiality Agreement, in which case the aggrieved party shall be
entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

Section 7.3 _Breakup Fee; Expenses_.

(a) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)_ or by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(g)_ as a result
of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change due to an Intervening Event, the
Company shall pay Parent up to $19,500,000 in respect of ParentÂ’s expenses in
connection with this Agreement (the " _Expense_

 



\- 60 -    __ _Reimbursement_ "), by wire transfer (to an account designated by
Parent) in immediately available funds within two business days after such
termination. If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(g)_ as a result of a Company Adverse Recommendation Change due
to a Company Superior Proposal, or (ii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)_ or  _Section 7.1(d)_, and in the case of any termination
pursuant to this clause (ii), (A) a Company Takeover Proposal shall have been
publicly announced or shall have become publicly known, and not withdrawn at
least fifteen (15) business days prior to the Company StockholdersÂ’ Meeting
and (B) at any time on or prior to the twelve month anniversary of such
termination the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Company Takeover Proposal or the transactions
contemplated by any Company Takeover Proposal are consummated, the Company
shall pay Parent the Termination Fee (less any amounts previously paid to
Parent in respect of the Expense Reimbursement), by wire transfer (to an
account designated by Parent) in immediately available funds (1) in the case
of clause (i), within two business days of such termination, in the case of
clause (ii) the Expense Reimbursement within two business days of such
termination and the Termination Fee (less any amounts previously paid to
Parent in respect of the Expense Reimbursement) upon the earlier of entering
into such definitive agreement with respect to a Company Takeover Proposal or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by a Company Takeover
Proposal. " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $98,000,000.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if
the Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this
_Section 7.3(a)_, from and after such termination and payment of the
Termination Fee pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section 7.3(a)_, the
Company shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in
connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other
than as provided under this _Section 7.3(a)_, except in the case of fraud or
a willful and material breach by the Company of this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges that the Termination Fee and Expense Reimbursement
are not intended to be a penalty, but rather are liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which
such Termination Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement are due and payable and
which do not involve fraud or willful and material breach, for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. In no event shall Parent
be entitled to more than one payment of the Termination Fee in connection
with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to which the Termination Fee is
payable, and if the Termination Fee is payable at such time as Parent has
already received payment from the Company in respect of Expense
Reimbursement, the amount of Expense Reimbursement actually received by Parent
shall be deducted from the Termination Fee.

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due
pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_, then (i) the Company shall reimburse Parent
for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and reasonable fees of
counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount, including in
connection with any related Actions commenced and (ii) the Company shall pay
to Parent interest on such amount from and including the date payment of

 



\- 61 -   such amount was due to but excluding the date of actual payment at the prime
rate set forth in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made plus 2%.

attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an

Section 8.8 _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any of

by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of Merger Sub and Parent may

assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section shall be
null and void. 

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is

other than the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived by the parties
hereto (which amendment or waiver must be in writing and signed) by action
taken or authorized (i) with respect to Parent and Merger Sub, by or on behalf
of their respective board of directors or other governing body and (ii) with
respect to the Company, by or on behalf of the Company Board, upon the
recommendation of the Company Special Committee if then in existence or

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that after receipt of Company Stockholder Approval,
no such amendment or waiver shall be made that would reduce the amount or

applicable Law or in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NYSE
require further approval of the stockholders of the Company, without approval
of such stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise of any other right hereunder.

unless and until the Effective Time shall have occurred). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (1) each Financing Source shall be an express third
party beneficiary of and shall be entitled to rely upon _Sections 8.5_ and

[Signature Page to Agreement and Plan of Merger] Exhibit A to the Merger Agreement

 

Term Sheet for Overriding Royalty Interests (the "Royalty Trust Term Sheet")

 



      |  | 
---|---|--- 
    Capitalized Terms |  | Capitalized terms used herein but not
defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger
by and among Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. (" _Parent_ "), INAVN Corp.
(" _Merger Sub_ ") and McMoRan Exploration Co. (the " _Company_ "), dated
December 5, 2012 (the " _Agreement_ "). 
   | 
  Transaction |  |

Prior to the Closing, Parent (with the reasonable cooperation of the Company,
as requested by Parent) will cause the Trust to be created pursuant to the
Trust Agreement. The Royalty Trust Units will be issued and distributed in a
manner consistent with the terms of the Agreement and this Term Sheet.

 



The total number of Royalty Trust Units issued by the Trust will be equal to
the fully diluted number of shares of the Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (for the avoidance of
doubt, (i) excluding any shares of Company Common Stock issuable in respect of
Company Stock Awards, which Company Stock Awards will not receive the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger, (ii) including any shares
beneficially owned by Parent or its subsidiaries or otherwise to be cancelled
at the effective time of the Merger and (iii) calculated based on the
assumption that all Company Convertible Securities receive the maximum make-
whole premium applicable to them in connection with the merger upon conversion
(as calculated as of the effective time of the Merger), as set forth in their
respective underlying agreements).



All Royalty Trust Units issued by the Trust and not distributable with
respect to shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the merger shall
be held by Parent upon the closing of the Merger, with the applicable number
of Royalty Trust Units to remain subject to the ongoing obligation of Parent
to deliver the Royalty Trust Units upon conversion of the outstanding Company
Convertible Securities, as set forth in their respective underlying
agreements.

 



For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any holder of a Company Stock
Award be issued Royalty Trust Units as consideration for such Company Stock
Award.



 

Pursuant to a master conveyance agreement (the " _Master Conveyance_ "),
Parent will cause the Company to convey to the Trust overriding royalty
interests in the Subject Interests (as defined below). The Master Conveyance
will be effective as of the Closing and in form and substance consistent with
this term sheet and otherwise satisfactory to Company and Parent. 

    | 
  Subject Interests |  |

All of CompanyÂ’s right, title and interest in and to leases listed in the
Master Conveyance (the " _Subject Interests_ ") will be subject to the
overriding royalty interests, subject to the restrictions described under
"Overriding Royalty Percentage" below.



 

The Subject Interests will generally include all of CompanyÂ’s existing shallow
water Gulf of Mexico and onshore Gulf Coast ultra deep (wells completed at a
depth of 18,000 feet or below) exploration prospects that are not classified
as proved reserves or probable or possible reserves as of the signing of the
merger agreement and without limitation will include all of CompanyÂ’s rights
currently owned or (with respect to which the Company is in the process of
acquiring) hereafter acquired by 

 

 ---|---|--- 
     |  | the Company or any of its Affiliates within the prospect
areas set forth on _Schedule A_. The Company and Parent will cooperate in good
faith between signing of the Merger Agreement and Closing to identify with
specificity the leases and blocks in which the Company has an interest
included within the Subject Interests, and the Master Conveyance will include
references to such specific leases and blocks. To the extent any such rights
which the Company is in the process of acquiring are acquired by the Company
or any of its Affiliates after the execution of the original Master
Conveyance, such rights will be transferred to the Trust pursuant to
a subsequently executed conveyance agreement in substantially the same form
and substance as the Master Conveyance. None of the Subject Interests have any
associated production at the time of the signing of the merger agreement. 
   | 
  Overriding Royalty Percentage |  | The Trust will receive a 5% gross
overriding royalty interests in and to the hydrocarbons saved and produced
from the Subject Interests, net to the CompanyÂ’s working interest. 
   | 
  Drilling, Operating and Development Costs |  |

The overriding royalty interests will be free and clear of any and all
drilling, development and operating costs and expenses;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the overriding royalty interest hydrocarbons will be valued
at the wellhead and neither the Company nor Parent will have any duty to
transport or market the produced hydrocarbons away from the wellhead
without cost, and provided further that the overriding royalty interest
hydrocarbons will be subject to and bear production and other like taxes.



 

The Parent and Company will include customary language protective of the trust
in the Trust Agreement and any other definitive documentation creating
the overriding royalty interest with respect to any transportation or
marketing of hydrocarbons that Parent or its controlled Affiliates may elect
to provide with respect to hydrocarbons produced from the Subject Interests
and the price utilized for purposes of calculating the overriding royalty
interest. 

   | 
  No Obligation to Drill or Develop |  | The Trust will have no ability
to influence the exploration or development of the Subject Interests. Parent
will have no obligation to commit or expend drilling, exploration
or development capital with respect to the Subject Interests. In addition,
Parent will have the right to elect not to participate in drilling or other
operations conducted by other working interest owners with respect to the
Subject Interests. 
   | 
  Term and Termination |  |

The Trust will terminate on the earlier of (i) the 20th anniversary of the
Closing, (ii) the sale of all of the royalty interests, or (iii) upon a vote
of the holders of 80% (which after the fifth anniversary of the Closing, shall
be reduced to 66-2/3%) or more of the outstanding Trust Units held by persons
other than Parent or any of its affiliates, at a duly called meeting of Trust
Unit holders at which a quorum is present.



The overriding royalty interests will terminate at the time of termination of
the Trust.



Parent will maintain a call right with respect to the outstanding Trust Units
at $10 per unit, provided that the call right may not be exercised prior to
the fifth anniversary of the Closing.

 



At any time after the fifth (5th) anniversary of Closing, if the VWAP (as
defined below) per Trust Unit is equal to $0.25 or less for the immediately
preceding consecutive nine-month period, Parent will maintain the right to
purchase all, but not less than all, of the outstanding Trust Units at a price
of $0.25 per Trust Unit so long as Parent tenders payment within 30 days of
such nine-month period. "VWAP" per 

  



2 ---|---|--- 
    |  | Trust Unit on any trading day means the market price of one
Trust Unit from the open of trading on the relevant trading day until the
close of trading on the relevant trading day determined, using a volume-
weighted average method. If the VWAP of the Trust Units can not be determined,
the closing price of the Trust Units for the relevant trading day, on the
market or system that the Trust Units are most commonly quoted or traded,
will be substituted for the VWAP. 
   | 
  Trust Expenses |  | Parent will fund the administrative and reporting
obligations of the Trust and all other expenses, up to a maximum amount of
$350,000 per year. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Parent will
discuss in good faith arrangements for Parent to lend money to the Trust to
cover expenses in excess of such amount and the repayment terms of such
indebtedness. 
   | 
  Listing; Registration |  | The Trust Units will be listed on a
national securities exchange. The Trust Units will be registered on issuance
and the Trust will therefore be subject to SEC reporting requirements. 
   | 
  Sale of Subject Interests |  | Parent may at any time transfer all or
part of the Subject Interests subject to the transferee assuming all
obligations (including the obligation to pay the overriding royalty)
and rights with respect to such Subject Interests under the Trust. 
   | 
  Transferability |  | The Trust Units will be transferable, subject to
customary procedural requirements. 
   | 
  Documentation |  | The Trust Units will be issued based on
documentation reasonably acceptable to Company and Parent. In the absence of
definitive documentation, the terms of this term sheet will control.
