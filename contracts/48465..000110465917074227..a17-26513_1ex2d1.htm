THIS SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " ** _Agreement_** ") is dated as of
October 30, 2017, and is entered into by and among Columbus Manufacturing,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " ** _Company_** "), 1492 Acquisition LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" ** _Seller_** "), and Hormel Foods
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" ** _Buyer_** "). The Company, Seller
and Buyer are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the " **
_Parties_** " and individually as a " ** _Party_**."

 



 

 ** _RECITALS_**

 



 

WHEREAS, Seller owns 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of the Company
(the " ** _Equity Securities_** ").

 



 

WHEREAS, Seller desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from
Seller, all of the Equity Securities for the consideration described herein.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby confirmed, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Parties intending to be legally bound hereby agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
_DEFINITIONS_**

 



 

The terms defined in **_Exhibit A_**, whenever used herein, shall have the
meanings set forth on **_Exhibit A_** for all purposes of this Agreement. The
definitions on **_Exhibit A_** are incorporated into this Agreement as if
fully set forth at length herein and all references to a section in such
**_Exhibit A_** are references to such section of this Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
_SALE AND PURCHASE_**

 



 

 **2.1** **_Purchase and Sale of Equity Securities; Purchase Price_**

 



 

(a) _Closing Date Consideration_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at Closing, Seller shall sell, transfer, assign, and convey the
Equity Securities, free and clear of all Liens, to Buyer, and Buyer shall
purchase and accept the Equity Securities from Seller. Buyer shall pay to
Seller, in respect of the Equity Securities, the Closing Date Consideration.
The " ** _Closing Date Consideration_** " shall be equal to Eight Hundred and
Fifty Million Dollars ($850,000,000.00) (the " ** _Base Purchase Price_** "),
as increased or decreased as follows (and as further adjusted pursuant
**_Section 2.3_)**:

 



 

(i) _Increases in the Closing Date Consideration_. The Closing Date
Consideration shall be increased by the following amounts:

 



 

(A) the Closing Cash Balance, if any; and

 



      
 

 



 

(B) the Working Capital Overage, if any.

 



 

(ii) _Decreases in the Closing Date Consideration_. The Closing Date
Consideration shall be decreased by the following amounts:

 



 

(A) the Working Capital Underage, if any;

 



 

(B) the aggregate amount of the Company Debt;

 



 

(C) the aggregate amount of the Selling Expenses; and

 



 

(D) the aggregate amount of the Closing Taxes Payable.

 



 

(b) _Estimated Closing Date Statement_. Not later than the third (3rd)
Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver,
or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Buyer an estimated closing statement
(the " ** _Estimated Closing Date Statement_** ") setting forth an unaudited
balance sheet of the Company as of the Effective Time (the " ** _Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet_** ") together with the Companys good faith calculation
of the Estimated Closing Date Consideration, and detailing each of the
following: (i) the estimated Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the
" ** _Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital_** "), (ii) the estimated
Closing Cash Balance as of the Effective Time (the " ** _Estimated Closing
Cash Balance_** "), (iii) the estimated Company Debt (the " ** _Estimated
Company Debt_** "), together with an itemization of each item of Company Debt,
identification of each Person to whom Company Debt is owing and the amount of
Company Debt owing to such Person, (iv) the estimated Selling Expenses (the "
** _Estimated Selling Expenses_** "), together with an itemization of each
Selling Expense, identification of each Person to whom such Selling Expense is
owing, the amount of Selling Expense owing to such Person, and the wire
transfer instructions of such Person to be used to pay such Selling Expense
(if any Selling Expense is to be paid to an employee of the Company, the
Estimated Closing Date Statement will identify the wire transfer instructions
of the Company as the recipient of the amount of such Selling Expense, and
such Selling Expense will be paid to the employee through normal payroll
processes of the Company), and (v) the estimated Closing Taxes Payable (the "
** _Estimated Closing Taxes Payable_** "). The Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet, the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Estimated Closing
Cash Balance, the Estimated Company Debt, the Estimated Selling Expenses and
the Estimated Closing Taxes Payable set forth in the Estimated Closing Date
Statement will be prepared in accordance with the principles set forth on
**_Exhibit B_** (the " ** _Accounting Principles_** "). Additionally, not
later than the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Buyer the Payoff Letters
reflecting the Company Debt set forth on **_Schedule 2.1(b)_**.

 



 

(c) _Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment_. If the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital is less than the bottom of the Company Net Working
Capital Range, then the Closing Date Consideration will be reduced by an
amount equal to the absolute value of the difference between the midpoint of
the Company Net Working Capital Range and the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital (such amount, if any, a " ** _Working Capital Underage_** ").
If the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater than the top of
the Company Net Working Capital Range, then the Closing Date Consideration
will be increased by

 



      
 

 



 

an amount equal to the difference between the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital and the midpoint of the Company Net Working Capital Range
(such amount, if any, a " ** _Working Capital Overage_** "). If the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital is within the Company Net Working Capital
Range, then the Closing Date Consideration will not be adjusted for any
Working Capital Underage or Working Capital Overage pursuant to this
**_Section 2.1(c)_**, but may be subject to adjustment for a Working Capital
Underage or Working Capital Overage following the Closing as provided in
**_Section 2.3_**.

 



 

 **2.2** **_Closing Payments_**. At the Closing, Buyer shall: (a) (i) on
behalf of the Company, cause the Estimated Company Debt set forth in the
Payoff Letters to be paid pursuant to the corresponding Payoff Letters, and
(ii) on behalf of the Company, pay to each Person identified in the Estimated
Closing Date Statement as being entitled to a Selling Expense, the Selling
Expense amount set forth in the Estimated Closing Date Statement with respect
to such Person, pursuant to the wire transfer instructions with respect to
such Person set forth in the Estimated Closing Date Statement, (b) deposit
with the Escrow Agent, pursuant to wire transfer instructions received by
Buyer from the Escrow Agent no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
Closing, (i) the Indemnity Escrow Amount to be deposited in an escrow account
(the " ** _Indemnity Escrow Account_** "), and (ii) the Adjustment Escrow
Amount to be deposited in an escrow account (the " ** _Adjustment Escrow
Account_** "), and (c) pay to Seller (pursuant to Sellers wire transfer
instructions set forth in the Estimated Closing Date Statement) the Estimated
Closing Date Consideration minus the Aggregate Escrow Amount (such amounts
contemplated by _(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(c)_ above, collectively, the " **
_Settlement Amounts_** ").

 



 

 **2.3** **_Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments_**.

 



 

(a) _Final Closing Date Statement_. Within seventy-five (75) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller an
unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the Effective Time (the " **
_Final Closing Balance Sheet_** "), together with a statement (the " ** _Final
Closing Date Statement_** "), setting forth Buyers good faith calculation of
the Closing Date Consideration, and detailing each of the following: (i) the
Net Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the " ** _Final Closing Date Net
Working Capital_** "), (ii) the Closing Cash Balance as of the Effective Time
(the " ** _Final Closing Cash Balance_** "), (iii) the Company Debt (the " **
_Final Company Debt_** "), (iv) the Selling Expenses (the " ** _Final Selling
Expenses_** "), and (v) the Closing Taxes Payable (the " ** _Final Closing
Taxes Payable_** "). The Final Closing Date Statement is to be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles. The Parties agree that the purpose
of preparing the Final Closing Date Statement and determining the Final
Closing Date Net Working Capital, Final Closing Cash Balance, Final Company
Debt, Final Selling Expenses and Final Closing Taxes Payable and the related
purchase price adjustment contemplated by this **_Section 2.3_** is to
measure the amount of change between (i) the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital and the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, (ii) the
Estimated Closing Cash Balance and the Final Closing Cash Balance, (iii) the
Estimated Company Debt and the Final Company Debt, (iv) the Estimated Selling
Expenses and the Final Selling Expenses, and (v) the Estimated Closing Taxes
Payable and the Final Closing Taxes Payable and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Final Closing Date
Statement or determining the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, Final
Closing Cash Balance, Final Company Debt, the

 



      
 

 



 

Final Selling Expenses, and the Final Closing Taxes Payable except, in each
case, to the extent such an introduction is necessary to comply with the
Accounting Principles.

 



 

(b) _Dispute_. Within thirty (30) days following receipt by Seller of the
Final Closing Balance Sheet and the Final Closing Date Statement (the " **
_Dispute Period_** "), Seller shall deliver written notice (a " ** _Dispute
Notice_** ") to Buyer of any disagreement Seller has with respect to the
preparation or content of the Final Closing Balance Sheet or the Final Closing
Date Statement. Such Dispute Notice must describe in reasonable detail the
items contained in the Final Closing Balance Sheet or Final Closing Date
Statement with which Seller disagrees and, to the extent available, the basis
for any such disagreement. If Seller does not provide Buyer with a Dispute
Notice within the Dispute Period, the Final Closing Balance Sheet and Final
Closing Date Statement delivered by the Buyer pursuant to **_Section
2.3(a)_** will be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. Any item in,
or omitted from, the Final Closing Date Statement that Seller does not
disagree with in the Dispute Notice shall be final, binding, and conclusive
for all purposes hereunder in the manner stated in, or omitted from, the Final
Closing Date Statement. In the event Seller provides Buyer with a Dispute
Notice, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve all
disagreements related thereto. If Buyer and Seller, notwithstanding such good
faith effort, fail to resolve any of the disagreements contained in the
Dispute Notice within thirty (30) days after Seller provides Buyer with such
Dispute Notice (which thirty (30)-day period may be extended by written
agreement of Buyer and Seller), then Buyer and Seller jointly shall engage the
accounting firm of Grant Thornton LLP or such other nationally recognized
accounting firm as may be mutually acceptable to Buyer and Seller (the " **
_Accounting Firm_** ") to resolve any such disagreement(s).

 



 

(c) _Method of Dispute Resolution_. Seller and Buyer will enter into a
customary engagement agreement with the Accounting Firm and agree to cooperate
in good faith with the Accounting Firm during the term of its engagement.
Seller and Buyer shall jointly instruct the Accounting Firm that it: (i) shall
review only the unresolved disputed items contained in the Dispute Notice;
(ii) shall make its determination based solely upon the written submissions of
Seller and Buyer (i.e., not by independent review), and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including the definitions set forth herein;
(iii) shall render its decision within thirty (30) days after the tender of
the written submissions of Seller and Buyer (described in further detail
below) to the Accounting Firm for a decision pursuant hereto; and (iv) shall
not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed
by either Party. As promptly as practicable following the Accounting Firms
engagement (the timeline for which shall be agreed to by Buyer and Seller or,
if Buyer and Seller cannot reach agreement on such timeline, set by the
Accounting Firm), Buyer and Seller shall each prepare and submit
simultaneously a written presentation to the Accounting Firm. Following the
delivery of the written presentations, Buyer and Seller may each submit a
response to the other Partys presentation (again, on a timeline to be agreed
to by Buyer and Seller or, if Buyer and Seller cannot reach agreement on such
timeline, set by the Accounting Firm). Neither Buyer nor Seller may take a
position in any written presentation or response that is more adverse to the
other Party than the position taken in the Final Closing Date Statement (with
respect to Buyer) or the Dispute Notice (with respect to Seller). As soon as
practicable thereafter, the Accounting Firm shall choose one of the Parties
positions for each disputed item based solely on their respective
presentations. Neither Seller nor Buyer (and none of their respective
representatives) shall have any ex parte conversation(s) or

 



      
 

 



 

meeting(s) with the Accounting Firm without the prior consent of (x) with
respect to Seller, Buyer and (y) with respect to Buyer, Seller. The fees,
costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be allocated to and borne by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based on the inverse of
the percentage that the Accounting Firms determination (before such
allocation) bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as
originally submitted to the Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in
dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm award $600 in favor
of Buyers position, 60% of the costs of its review would be borne by Seller
and 40% of the costs would be borne by Buyer. All determinations made by the
Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.
Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any
court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such determination is
to be enforced.

 



 

(d) _Access_. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this
**_Section 2.3_**, each Party shall promptly and reasonably cooperate with
and make reasonably available to the other Parties and their respective
representatives all information, records, data and working papers, including
reasonable access to its applicable accounting and finance personnel during
normal business hours, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation and analysis of the Estimated Closing Date Statement and the Final
Closing Date Statement and the resolution of any disagreement related thereto
(except that no Party will be required to make available or give access to or
otherwise disclose any information if such access or disclosure would
jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege or contravene any applicable
Law). The written submissions described in **_Section_** ** _ _** **
_2.3(c)_** may not be required to be submitted to the Accounting Firm until
such reasonable cooperation and reasonable access to information and
applicable personnel have been granted.

 



 

(e) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. Not later than the third (3rd) Business Day
after the date on which all of the items on the Final Closing Balance Sheet
and the Final Closing Date Statement are finally determined pursuant to this
**_Section 2.3_**, Seller and Buyer shall jointly determine the amount by
which the Estimated Closing Date Consideration would have been adjusted
pursuant to **_Section 2.1_** had the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital,
the Final Closing Cash Balance, the Final Company Debt, the Final Selling
Expenses, and the Final Closing Taxes Payable, in each case, as finally
determined pursuant to this **_Section 2.3_**, been substituted for the
Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Estimated Closing Cash
Balance, the Estimated Company Debt, the Estimated Selling Expenses, and the
Estimated Closing Taxes Payable respectively, as of the Closing.

 



 

(i) If such substitution would have resulted in a Closing Date Consideration
that is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Consideration (any such
excess, the " ** _Price Increase_** "), then Buyer shall pay or cause to be
paid to Seller, within three (3) Business Days from the date on which the
Final Closing Date Statement is finally determined pursuant to this **_Section
2.3_**, by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to Sellers
wire transfer instructions set forth in the Estimated Closing Date Statement,
an aggregate amount in cash equal to the Price Increase and Buyer and Seller
shall execute joint written instructions directing the Escrow Agent to release
to Seller all funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account.

 



 

(ii) If such substitution would have resulted in a Closing Date Consideration
that is less than the Estimated Closing Date Consideration (the absolute value
of such deficit, the

 



      
 

 



 

" ** _Price Decrease_** "), then Buyer and Seller shall execute joint written
instructions directing the Escrow Agent to, (x) if the Price Decrease is less
than funds held in the Adjustment Escrow Account, release to Buyer the amount
of the Price Decrease from the Adjustment Escrow Account and release the
amounts remaining in the Adjustment Escrow Account to Seller, or (y) if the
Price Decrease is greater than the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account,
release to Buyer all amounts in the Adjustment Escrow Account and funds from
the Indemnity Escrow Account equal to the remaining balance of the Price
Decrease. Such joint written instructions shall be executed and delivered
within three (3) Business Days from the date on which the Final Closing Date
Statement is finally determined pursuant to this **_Section 2.3_**.

 



 

(iii) If such substitution would have resulted in a Closing Date Consideration
equal to the Estimated Closing Date Consideration, then no adjustment shall be
made to the consideration payable hereunder pursuant to this **_Section
2.3_** and Buyer and Seller shall execute joint written instructions directing
the Escrow Agent to release to Seller all funds in the Adjustment Escrow
Account.

 



 

 **2.4** **_Withholding_**. Seller, Buyer, and the Company (as appropriate)
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as are required by
applicable Tax Law to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. If any amounts are to be withheld pursuant to the preceding sentence
(other than in connection with compensatory payments), Buyer or the Company
(as appropriate) shall provide any such person with adequate notice of and
justification for such deduction and withholding; provided, however, that in
no event will such obligation prevent Buyer or the Company from making a
timely payment of such deducted or withheld amounts to the relevant
Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made.

Date will not be recognized for retiree medical and defined benefit pension
plan benefits. In the plan year in which the Closing occurs, no pre-existing
condition limitations, exclusions or waiting periods applicable with respect
to medical benefits under the Buyer Welfare Plans will apply to Company
Employees to the extent that such limitations, exclusions or waiting periods
did not apply to such Company Employee under the corresponding Employee Plan
providing medical benefits as of the Closing Date to the extent that Company
provides Buyer sufficient information regarding such status. The Buyer Welfare
Plans that are medical benefit plans in which a Company Employee participates
after the Closing Date will use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize,
for purposes of satisfying any deductible, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums
during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, any payment made by
such Company Employee in such plan year prior to the Closing Date toward
deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums in any corresponding Employee
Plan to the extent that Company provides Buyer sufficient information
regarding such amounts.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be solely responsible for issuing, serving and delivering all
orders and notices required, if any, pursuant to the WARN Act or its state law
equivalent, in connection with the termination of any employees of the Company
after the Closing Date. Further, Buyer shall either (i) retain the Company
Employees to the extent necessary to avoid any requirement that the Company
deliver notifications with respect to any Company Employees or any individual
employed by the Company within the 90 day period prior to the Closing Date
pursuant to the WARN Act or its state law equivalent, if any; or (ii) to the
extent necessary provide any notices to the Company Employees required under
the WARN Act in accordance with the WARN Act.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this **_Section 7.8_**, whether express or implied, shall: (i)
confer upon any Company Employee or other Person any rights or remedies,
including any right to employment or continued employment for any period or
any terms or conditions of employment, or any third-party beneficiary rights
hereunder; (ii) be interpreted to prevent or restrict Buyer or its Affiliates
(including, following the Closing Date, the Company) from modifying or
terminating the employment or terms of employment of any Company Employee,
including the amendment or termination of any benefit or compensation plan,
program, policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement, after the Closing; or
(iii) be treated as an establishment or an amendment or other modification of
any Employee Plan or other compensation or benefit plan, program, policy,
Contract, agreement or arrangement.

 



 

 **7.9** **_No Shop_**. Each of Seller and the Company shall not, and shall
cause their respective officers, directors, partners, employees, Affiliates,
agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate,
discuss, entertain, undertake, authorize, recommend, propose, seek, enter into
or encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any Person relating
to the acquisition of any portion of the Equity Securities or other Equity
Interests or any portion of the assets (other than inventory sold in the
Ordinary Course of Business) of, or similar transaction involving, the Company
or Seller (including any acquisition structured as a merger, joint venture,
consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) (each, an " ** _Acquisition
Proposal_** "); _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that the Companys representatives
may respond to unsolicited inquiries, but solely for the purpose of
communicating that the Company is not able to entertain the unsolicited offer.
Seller and the Company shall (and shall cause their respective officers,
directors, partners, employees, Affiliates, agents and representatives to)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than Buyer) with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and to immediately cause to be terminated access to the
data room prepared by Seller with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than to Buyer).

 



 

 **7.10** **_Antitrust and Other Closing Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and Buyer agrees to file all appropriate notifications
and filings pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in the most
expeditious manner practicable, but in any event within five (5) Business Days
after the date hereof and to respond promptly to any request for additional
information and documentary material that may be issued to such Party by the
relevant Governmental Authorities in connection with the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law. Each of the Company and Buyer agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts

 



      
 

 



 

to obtain early termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or any
other applicable Antitrust Law. No Party shall take any action or step to
extend, delay, or prevent the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Law without the express
advance written consent of the other Parties. Buyer agrees to use, and to
cause its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or
eliminate as soon as practicable each and every impediment under the HSR Act
or any other applicable Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any United
States or foreign antitrust Governmental Authority, provided however, that
Buyer, notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision hereof to the
contrary, shall not be required to (and shall not be required to cause its
Affiliates to) (i) pursue or defend against any Action, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, in order to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law that
may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) propose, accept, negotiate, commit to or
effect by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture, licensing or disposition of any assets or businesses of Buyer (or
its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the
Company), or (iii) otherwise take or commit to take actions that limit Buyers
or its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the
Companys, freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain, any of
the businesses, product lines or assets of Buyer (or its subsidiaries or other
Affiliates, including, following the Closing, the Company). Each of the
Company and Buyer agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any United States or
foreign antitrust Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other Party in
advance, if at all possible, and, to the extent not prohibited by such
antitrust Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to
attend and participate. The Company and Buyer will supply each other with (a)
in advance of submission and with a reasonable opportunity for review and
comment thereon, a draft of any contemplated substantive communication with an
antitrust Governmental Authority relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby; and (b) copies of all correspondence, filings or communications with
antitrust Governmental Authorities, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that to extent any of
the documents or information are commercially or competitively sensitive, the
Company or Buyer, as the case may be, may satisfy its obligations by providing
such documents or information to the other Partys outside antitrust counsel,
with the understanding and agreement that such antitrust counsel shall not
share such documents and information with its client.

 



 

(b) No Party will enter into any transaction, or any contractual arrangement
or other agreement, whether oral or written, to effect any transaction
(including any merger or acquisition) that could reasonably be expected to
make it more difficult, or to increase the time required, to: (i) obtain the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or any other
applicable Antitrust Law, (ii) avoid the entry of, or effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order or decree that
would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Each of Buyer and the Company shall cooperate reasonably with one another
(a) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents, approvals or
waivers are required to be obtained from third parties to any Leases or
Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers;
_provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall obligate or be construed to
obligate any of Buyer, Seller or the Company to make or cause to be made (and,
without Buyers prior written consent, neither Seller nor the Company shall
make) any payment or concession to any third party in order to obtain any such
action, consent, approval or waiver under any Lease or Contract or from any
Governmental Authority other than the payment of nominal administrative,
processing or similar charges, or other legally required filing fees in
connection with filings with any Governmental Authority, or as otherwise
specifically required by this Agreement.

 



 

 **7.11** **_Non-Solicit_**. Seller agrees that, for a period commencing on
the Closing Date and ending on the date that is twelve (12) months after the
Closing Date, it shall not, and it will cause its Affiliates to not, solicit
for employment or hire any director-level (or higher) or sales employee of the
Company; provided that this **_Section_** ** _ _** ** _7.11_** shall not
prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from (a) conducting a general solicitation
or advertisement that is not specifically directed at employees of the
Company, (b) soliciting for employment or hiring any individuals who have not
been employed or engaged by the Company for a period of six months prior to
the date such individuals were first solicited for employment, or (c)
responding to unsolicited inquiries regarding employment. The undertakings in
this **_Section 7.11_** are given to Buyer and to each of its Affiliates
(including the Company). Seller acknowledges that such undertakings are
entirely independent restrictions and are no greater than is reasonably
necessary to protect the interests of Buyer and its Affiliates. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this **_Section 7.11_** is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties
agree that such court making the determination of invalidity or
unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope or duration of the
term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases or to replace any
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is
valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of
the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be
enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which the
judgment may be appealed.

 



 

 **7.12** **_Tax Matters_**. The Company shall (a) prior to the Closing Date,
solicit from each "disqualified individual" with respect to the Company
(within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) who could otherwise
receive any payment or benefits that would constitute a "parachute payment"
(within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) a waiver of such
disqualified individuals rights to some or all of such payments or benefits
(the " ** _Waived 280G Benefits_** ") so that all remaining payments and/or
benefits, if any, shall not be deemed to be "excess parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) and (b) prior to the Closing
Date, with respect to each individual who agrees to the waiver described in
clause (a), submit to a stockholder vote (along with adequate disclosure
satisfying the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any
regulations promulgated thereunder) the right of any such "disqualified
individual" to receive the Waived 280G Benefits. Prior to soliciting such
waivers and approval materials, the Company shall provide drafts of such
waivers and approval

 



      
 

 



 

materials to Buyer for its review and comment no later than two (2) Business
Days prior to soliciting such waivers and soliciting such approval, and the
Company shall consider any comments provided by Buyer in good faith. If any of
the Waived 280G Benefits fail to be approved in accordance with the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code as contemplated above, such
Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Buyer evidence reasonably acceptable to Buyer that a
vote of the stockholders of the Company was solicited in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this **_Section_** ** _ _** ** _7.12_** and that
either (i) the requisite number of votes of the stockholders of the Company
was obtained with respect to the Waived 280G Benefits (the " ** _280G
Approval_** ") or (ii) the 280G Approval was not obtained, and, as a
consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided.

 



 

 **7.13** **_Data Room_**. Within five (5) Business Days of the Closing Date,
Seller will deliver to Buyer three (3) digital copies of the data room
prepared by Seller with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

Indemnitees may proceed against Indemnity Escrow Amount pursuant to this
**_Article X_**, and _third_ , if the proceeds of the forgoing are
insufficient to satisfy such claim, then the Buyer Indemnitees may proceed
against Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuing coverage under the RandW
Insurance Policy is not a condition to a Buyer Indemnitee submitting a claim
for a breach of any Company Fundamental Rep and tolling the Limitation Date
with respect to such claim or initiating a claim against the applicable
portion of the Indemnity Escrow Amount.

 



 

(e) _Treatment of Certain Claims_. Notwithstanding the foregoing terms, **
_Section 10.4_** will not limit any Losses with respect to Fraud.

 



 

(f) _Other Recovery_. If any Losses sustained by an Indemnitee are covered by
an insurance policy or an indemnification, contribution or similar obligation
of another Person (other than an Affiliate of such Indemnitee), the Indemnitee
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect such insurance proceeds
or indemnity, contribution or similar payments. The amount of any Losses
subject to indemnification under **_Section 10.2_** shall be reduced by the
amounts actually recovered by any Indemnitee, as applicable, under applicable
insurance policies

 



      
 

 



 

or an indemnification, contribution or similar obligation of another Person
(other than an Affiliate of such Indemnitee) with respect to claims related to
such Losses (net of any costs or expenses incurred in connection with the
recovery or receipt of such insurance proceeds, including any increases in
insurance premiums or retroactive premiums resulting therefrom), and if any
Indemnitee receives such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or
similar payments after the settlement or payment of any indemnification claim
under **_Section 10.2_**, as applicable, such Indemnitee shall refund to the
Indemnitor the amount of such insurance proceeds (net of any costs or expenses
incurred in connection with the recovery or receipt of such insurance
proceeds, including any increases in insurance premiums or retroactive
premiums resulting therefrom) or indemnity, contribution or similar payments,
up to the amount received in connection with such indemnification claim. It is
the intention of the Parties that no insurer or third party shall be entitled
to any benefit or right it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of
this paragraph.

 



 

(g) _Tax Benefit_. The amount of any Losses subject to indemnification under
**_Section 10.2_** shall be calculated net of any Indemnity Tax Benefit
actually realized by the Indemnitee on account of Losses in the taxable year
of the Losses or the immediately succeeding taxable year and increased to take
into account any Tax cost actually realized as a result of the receipt of the
related indemnity payment. If the Indemnitee receives an Indemnity Tax Benefit
relating to a Loss after an indemnification payment is made to him, her or it
with respect to such Loss (and in the taxable year of the Loss or the
immediately succeeding taxable year), the Indemnitee shall promptly pay to the
Indemnitor that made such indemnification payment the amount of such Indemnity
Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such Indemnity Tax
Benefit is actually realized or received by the Indemnitee. For purposes
hereof, " ** _Indemnity Tax Benefit_** " shall mean any refund of Taxes paid
or reduction in the amount of cash Taxes paid or payable attributable to such
indemnified Losses determined on a with-and-without basis and assuming that
the Company recognizes all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit and uses all net operating losses or net operating loss carryovers,
carryforwards or carrybacks, before realizing any Indemnity Tax Benefit.

 



 

(h) _Damage Exclusions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or provided for under any applicable Law, no Party shall be
liable to any other Person for, either in contract or in tort, and Losses
shall not include, any direct punitive damages of such other Person, unless
awarded in a Third Party Claim.

 



 

(i) _Double Recovery_. No Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover
damages or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity to the
extent that any Buyer Indemnitee has been compensated therefor pursuant to
**_Section 2.3_** or otherwise.

 



 

(j) _Materiality_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, for purposes of determining (i) whether there has been a breach of
any representation or warranty, and (ii) the amount of any Losses that are the
subject matter of a claim for indemnification pursuant to this **_Article
X_**, each representation and warranty in this Agreement, including the
Schedules and exhibits hereto, and any Certificate, Seller Document, or
Company Document shall be read without regard and without giving effect to the
term, or, as applicable, clause containing, "material", "materiality",
"Material Adverse Effect", or "material adverse effect" or similar phrases or
clauses contained in such representation or warranty.

 



       
 

 



 

(k) _Reserve_. The Buyer Indemnitees right to indemnification pursuant to
**_Section 10.2(b)_** shall be reduced by the amount of any reserve for the
general category of items or matters similar in nature to the specific items
or matters giving rise to such Loss which was taken into account in connection
with the determination of the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital.

 



 

(j) _Subrogation_. Buyer, on behalf of Buyer and each other Buyer Indemnitee,
agrees that the RandW Insurance Policy shall expressly exclude any right of
subrogation in favor of the RandW Insurance Provider against Seller or any of
Sellers officers, managers, directors, equity holders, employees or agents
under this Agreement or in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby,
other than with respect to rights of recovery against any such Person in cases
of Fraud.

 



 

 **10.5** **_Notice and Determination of Claims_**. If any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder (the " ** _Indemnitee_** ") believes that it has
sustained or incurred any Losses that are recoverable under this **_Article_**
** _ _** ** _X_** (a " ** _Claim_** "), such Indemnitee shall so notify the
Party obligated to provide such indemnification (the " ** _Indemnitor_** ")
promptly in writing specifying the basis hereunder upon which the Indemnitees
claim for indemnification is asserted and the facts and circumstances
concerning such Claim, describing such Losses, the amount thereof, or a good
faith estimate of the amount, and the method of computation of such Losses,
all with reasonable particularity, in each case to the extent known (the " **
_Claim Notice_** "). After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the
amount of indemnification to which a person shall be entitled under this
**_Article_** ** _ _** ** _X_** shall be determined: (a) by the written
agreement between the Parties; (b) by a final judgment or decree of any court
of competent jurisdiction; or (c) by any other means to which the Parties
shall agree in writing. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed
final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall
have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined.
A failure by an Indemnitee to give timely notice as provided in this
**_Section_** ** _ _** ** _10.5_** or in **_Section_** ** _ _** ** _10.6_**
will not affect the rights or obligations of any Party except and only to the
extent that, as a result of such failure, the Party entitled to receive such
notice was materially damaged as a result of such failure to give timely
notice vis-a-vis its rights and obligations hereunder or otherwise.

 



 

 **10.6** **_Third Party Claims_**.

 



 

(a) Promptly following the receipt of notice of a Claim by a third party
against a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee (a " ** _Third Party Claim_**
"), the party receiving the notice of the Third Party Claim shall provide the
other party with a Claim Notice with respect to such Third Party Claim.
Subject to receiving a confidentiality undertaking from the Indemnitor and any
redactions that the Indemnitee determines are advisable for purposes of
maintaining privilege, such Claim Notice shall be accompanied by copies of all
documents and information relevant to the Third Party Claim and in the
Indemnitees possession.

 



 

(b) Subject to **_Section_** ** _ _** ** _10.6(c)_** and **_Section_** ** _
_** ** _10.6(d)_** , the Indemnitor shall (subject to the right of the RandW
Insurance Providers) have the option to conduct and control, through counsel
of its choosing, the defense, compromise and settlement of any Third Party
Claim as to which indemnification is sought by any Indemnitee from any
Indemnitor hereunder. The Indemnitor shall notify the Indemnitee in writing,
as promptly as possible (but in any case before

 



      
 

 



 

the earlier of (i) ten (10) Business Days prior to the due date for the answer
or response to the Third Party Claim and (ii) thirty (30) days after receipt
of the notice of Third Party Claim given by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor
under **_Section_** ** _ _** ** _10.6(a)_** of its election to assume the
defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnitee may participate, through
counsel chosen by it and at its own expense (except that the Indemnitor will
be responsible for the fees and expenses of the Indemnitees separate counsel
(but not more than one law firm per jurisdiction) if the Indemnitee reasonably
concludes that counsel to the Indemnitor has a conflict of interest), in the
defense of any such Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnitor has so
elected to conduct and control the defense thereof. Should an Indemnitor
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this **_Section
10.6_**, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any legal
expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the investigation or
defense thereof (except that the Indemnitor will be responsible for the fees
and expenses of the Indemnitees separate counsel (but not more than one law
firm per jurisdiction) if the Indemnitee reasonably concludes that counsel to
the Indemnitor has a conflict of interest).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in **_Section 10.6(a)_** to the contrary, in no
event shall the Indemnitor be entitled to conduct and control the defense,
compromise and settlement of any Third Party Claim if (i) such claim seeks (or
there is a reasonable probability that such Third Party Claim could result in)
an injunction, other equitable relief or any other non-monetary relief against
the Indemnitee, (ii) in the event such claim were to be decided adversely to
the Indemnitee, the aggregate amount of Losses associated therewith, together
with all other outstanding Claims would reasonably be expected to exceed the
aggregate liability limitations set forth in **_Section 10.4(a)_**, or (iii)
such claim relates to or arises out of any allegedly criminal activity.
Additionally, notwithstanding anything in **_Section 10.6(a)_** to the
contrary, in no event shall the Indemnitor be entitled to consent to the entry
of any judgment, compromise, settle or discharge any Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(d) Any party controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim shall conduct
the defense of such Third Party Claim with reasonable diligence and shall keep
the other party reasonably informed of the status thereof. Whether or not the
Indemnitee shall control the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee
shall not consent to the entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or
discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitor (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Indemnitee shall cooperate in connection with any Third Party
Claim pursuant to this **_Section_** ** _ _** ** _10.6_** and shall furnish
such records, information and testimony and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested by
the Indemnitor in connection therewith; provided that, notwithstanding
anything in this **_Section_** ** _ _** ** _10.6_** to the contrary, the
Indemnitee shall not be required to take any action hereunder that would
adversely affect, or require or constitute a waiver of, any attorney-client or
other privilege.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any provision of this **_Section 10.6_** to the contrary,
any Third Party Claim relating to Taxes will be subject to the applicable
provisions of **_Article XI_**.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this **_Section_** ** _ _** ** _10.6_**
to the contrary, Seller (i) shall have the sole right to control the
prosecution and defense of any Claims related to the Indemnified Matters and
(ii) may settle, compromise or discharge any Claims related to the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnified Matters, without the prior written consent of the Buyer or the
Company, if (x) the sole relief provided in the settlement or compromise is
monetary damages that are either paid in full by Seller or due to the Company
and (y) the compromise or settlement includes an unconditional and irrevocable
complete release of the Company and the Buyer. Buyer must approve any
settlement other than as provided in this **_Section_** ** _ _** **
_10.6(f)(ii)_**. Buyer may participate, through counsel chosen by it and at
its own expense, in the defense of any Claims related to the Indemnified
Matters. If the Company receives any proceeds as a result of the Indemnified
Matters, the Company shall promptly pay the aggregate amount of any such
proceeds to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such
account as may be instructed by Seller.

 



 

 **10.7** **_Escrow_**. On the Indemnity Escrow Termination Date, the balance
of the funds remaining in the Indemnity Escrow Account (less the aggregate
portion of the remaining funds in the Indemnity Escrow Amount claimed by any
Buyer Indemnitee pursuant to a Claim or Third Party Claim in accordance with
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and not resolved prior to such date)
shall be released to Seller. At any time following the Indemnity Escrow
Termination Date, to the extent the available balance in the Indemnity Escrow
Account exceeds the aggregate portion of the amount claimed by any Buyer
Indemnitee pursuant to a Claim or Third Party Claim made in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and not resolved prior
to the time of determination, such excess shall be promptly released to Seller
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by Seller.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XI 
_TAX MATTERS_**

 



 

 **11.1** **_Administration of Tax Matters_**. Seller shall prepare and timely
file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, with the relevant Taxing
Authorities all federal, state and non-U.S. Tax Returns of the Company for any
Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are required to be filed by the Company on or
after the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items
on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of the
Company with respect to such items, except as required by applicable Law.
Seller shall, at least thirty (30) days prior to filing any such Tax Return,
provide a copy of such Tax Return to Buyer. Buyer shall, within ten (10) days
of receiving such Tax Return, advise Seller regarding any matters in such Tax
Return with which it reasonably disagrees. In such case, Seller and Buyer
shall reasonably cooperate with each other to reach a timely and mutually
satisfactory solution to the disputed matters. To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the Parties agree that all losses, deductions, credits and any
other Tax benefits available on account of the payment or incurrence of the
Transaction Tax Deductions shall be reported in Pre-Closing Tax Periods.

 



 

 **11.2** **_Allocation of Liability for Taxes_**. In the case of any Taxes
that are attributable to a Straddle Period, the amount of Taxes attributable
to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined as follows:

 



 

(a) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to income, receipts or
payroll (including withholding), the portion attributable to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period shall be determined on the basis of an interim closing of the books
of Company as of the Closing Date, and the

 



      
 

 



 

determination of the hypothetical Tax for such Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined on the basis of such interim closing of the books; and

 



 

(b) in the case of any other Taxes, the portion attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be the amount of such Taxes for the entire taxable
period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the entire taxable period.

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, any Taxes of the Company that have been paid or
otherwise remitted to the applicable Taxing Authority before the Closing Date
by the Company or the Seller, as the case may be, with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or that reduce the Purchase Price as a result of inclusion
in Final Closing Taxes Payable shall be credited toward any allocation of
liability for Taxes by Seller under this **_Article XI_**.

 



 

 **11.3** **_Cooperation; Tax Actions_**.

 



 

(a) In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns and any Actions relating
to the Tax liabilities imposed on the Company (or any successor thereof),
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully
with each other, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other Party,
including the furnishing or making available during normal business hours of
records, personnel (as reasonably required), books of account, powers of
attorney or other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such
Tax Returns or the conduct of, pursuit or defense of any Actions by Taxing
Authorities as to the imposition of Taxes. Buyer shall and shall cause the
Company to (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters
pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
(including any extension thereof) for the respective taxable periods, and to
abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Taxing
Authority, and (ii) give Seller reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and shall
allow Seller to take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(b) Buyer and Seller shall, upon request, use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain any certificate or other document from any Person as may be
necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed
(including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

 



 

 **11.4** **_Amended Tax Returns_**. Unless required by applicable Law,
without Sellers prior written consent (which consent cannot be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed) neither Buyer nor the Company nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall amend, refile, revoke or otherwise modify
any Tax Return or Tax election of the Company (or any successor(s) thereof)
with respect to a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to
the Closing Date.

 



 

 **11.5** **_Transfer Taxes_**. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest) incurred in connection with the sale of the Equity Securities to
Buyer under this Agreement, shall be borne by Buyer, and Buyer shall file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such

 



      
 

 



 

Taxes and fees. Buyer shall promptly pay when due all such required amounts to
the appropriate Taxing Authority.

 



 

 **11.6** **_Refunds and Credits_**. Following the Closing Date, the amount of
any Tax refunds (including, for the avoidance of doubt, overpayments of
estimated Taxes) or credits in lieu of a cash Tax refund (including any
interest paid or credited with respect thereto) of, or with respect to, the
Company relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or any portion of a Straddle
Period ending on the Closing Date, will be payable to Seller. Buyer shall, at
Sellers request, file (or cause to be filed) any Tax Return (including any
amended Tax Return) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any portion of a
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date to claim any material refunds (or
credits in lieu of a cash Tax refund) to which the Seller may be entitled
hereunder. If the amount of Taxes for the Tax period ending on the Closing
Date is less than the amount of estimated Taxes paid on or before the Closing
Date, any excess will be payable to Seller as a refund hereunder. If at any
time prior to paying over any Tax refund (or credits in lieu of a cash Tax
refund) pursuant to this **_Section_** ** _ _** ** _11.6_** , the Company has
any Excess Tax Liabilities, Buyer may, or may cause the Company to, first
apply such refund (or credits in lieu of a cash Tax refund) (and any interest
received in respect thereof) to reduce such Excess Tax Liabilities. To the
extent such Tax refund (or credits in lieu of a cash Tax refund) exceeds the
Excess Tax Liabilities, Buyer shall refund the excess to Seller hereunder.
Buyer shall notify Seller of an intent to apply a refund pursuant to this
**_Section_** ** _ _** ** _11.6_** thirty (30) days before such refund is
applied. Such notice (the " ** _Excess Tax Liabilities Notice_** ") will
include details of any related calculations and the nature of any Excess Tax
Liabilities. If Seller does not respond within fifteen (15) days to the
Excess Tax Liabilities Notice (or if Seller indicates earlier agreement), then
Buyer or the Company may apply any refund as indicated in such Excess Tax
Liabilities Notice. If Seller objects to the Excess Tax Liabilities Notice,
then Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objection.

ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INFORMED BY THE OTHER PARTY THAT THIS **_SECTION
12.11_** CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT UPON WHICH THE PARTIES ARE RELYING
AND WILL RELY IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER AGREEMENTS
RELATING HERETO OR CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL
COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS **_SECTION 12.11_** WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN
EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.

 



 

 **12.12** **_Severability_**. So long as the economic and legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any Party, any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable, Buyer, the Company and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 



 

 **12.13** **_Counterparts_**. This Agreement and all other documents related
hereto may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be deemed
an original, but such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the
same Agreement. The execution of this Agreement and any agreement or
instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendment
hereto or thereto, by any of the Parties may be evidenced by way of a
facsimile, portable document format (.pdf) transmission, or other electronic
transmission of such Partys signature, and such facsimile, portable document
format (.pdf), or other electronically transmitted signature shall be deemed
to constitute the original signature of such Party.

 



      
 

 



 

 **12.14** **_Enforcement of Agreement_**. The Parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in addition to (a)
any other remedy to which they are entitled hereunder, at law or in equity,
prior to the Closing Date, or (b) any other remedy to which they are entitled
hereunder after the Closing Date.

 



 

 **12.15** **_Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters_**.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise expressly provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the
following rules of interpretation shall apply:

 



 

(i) _Calculation of Time Period_. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in calculating
such period shall be excluded. If the last day of such period is a non-
Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next succeeding Business
Day.

 



 

(ii) _Dollars_. Any reference in this Agreement to $ shall mean U.S. dollars.

 



 

(iii) _Exhibits/Schedules_. The Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are
hereby incorporated and made a part hereof and are an integral part of this
Agreement. All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in
full herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not
otherwise defined therein shall be defined as set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

(iv) _Gender and Number_. Any reference in this Agreement to gender shall
include all genders, and words imparting the singular number only shall
include the plural and vice versa.

 



 

(v) _Headings_. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections and other subdivisions and the insertion of
headings are for convenience of reference only and shall not affect or be
utilized in construing or interpreting this Agreement. All references in this
Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding Section of this Agreement
unless otherwise specified.

 



 

(vi) _Herein_. The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement as a whole and not merely to a subdivision
in which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

 



 

(vii) _Including_. The word "including" or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and shall not be construed to limit any
general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters
immediately following it.

 



      
 

 



 

(viii) _Law_. Unless expressly stated herein to the contrary, reference to any
Law means such Law as amended, modified, codified, replaced or reenacted, in
whole or in part, and as in effect from time to time, including any rule or
regulation promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(ix) _Delivered, Furnished, Made Available_. Any document described as being
"delivered," "furnished," or "made available" shall be treated as such if a
copy of such document has been put in the data room prepared by Seller no
later than 5:00 p.m. central time on the day immediately preceding the date of
this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by
the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

 



 

 **12.16** **_Disclosure Schedules_**. The Schedules have been arranged as
separately-titled Schedules corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Schedules or in this
Agreement or the omission of any cross reference thereto, the information and
disclosures contained in any Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed and
incorporated by reference in any other Schedule as though fully set forth in
such Schedule for which applicability of such information and disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in any Schedule: (a) shall not be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement; (b) shall not be
construed as or constitute an admission, evidence or agreement that a
violation, right of termination, default, non-compliance, liability or other
obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item, (c) with respect to
the enforceability of Contracts with third-parties, the existence or non-
existence of third party rights, the absence of breaches or defaults by third-
parties, or similar matters or statements, is intended only to allocate rights
and risks among the Parties and is not intended to be admissions against
interests, give rise to any inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible
against any Party by any Person who is not a Party, or give rise to any claim
or benefit to any entity or person who is not a Party; (d) shall not be deemed
or interpreted to broaden or to narrow the representations and warranties,
obligations, covenants, conditions or agreements of the Company or Seller
contained in this Agreement; and (e) does not waive any attorney-client
privilege associated with such item or information or any protection afforded
by the work-product doctrine with respect to any of the matters disclosed or
discussed herein. Unless the context otherwise requires (for example, a
Schedule corresponds to a representation and warranty that requires disclosure
of information that is "material" or that would reasonably be expected to
constitute a "Material Adverse Effect"), such information and the dollar
thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the
terms "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this
Agreement. Neither the specifications of any dollar amount in any
representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement nor the
inclusion of any specific item in the Seller Disclosure Schedules and/or the
Company Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such amount, or higher
or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no Person shall use the fact of the setting forth of any such
amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy between
the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described herein
or included in the Seller

 



      
 

 



 

Disclosure Schedules or the Company Disclosure Schedules is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

 **12.17** **_Independent Legal Counsel; Continuing Representation_**.

 



 

(a) Each Party has had the benefit of independent legal counsel with respect
to the preparation of this Agreement. This Agreement expresses the mutual
intent of the Parties and each Party has participated equally in its
preparation. Accordingly, the rule on construction against the drafting party
shall have no application to this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereby
agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors, managers, members,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that DLA Piper LLP (US) may
serve as counsel to each and any of Seller, its members, the members of its
board of managers, and its Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " **
_Seller Group_** "), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, DLA Piper LLP (US) (or any successor) may serve as
counsel to the Seller Group or any director, manager, member, partner,
officer, employee or Affiliate of any member of the Seller Group, in
connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation of the
Company, to the extent applicable Rules of Professional Conduct so allow. In
connection with any representation of the Company expressly permitted pursuant
to the prior sentence, Buyer hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to
assert, and agrees to cause the Company to irrevocably waive and not to assert
any conflict of interest (other than conflicts of interest that are not
waivable under applicable Rules of Professional Conduct) arising from or in
connection with (i) DLA Piper LLP (US)s prior representation of the Company
and (ii) DLA Piper LLP (US)s representation of Seller and its Affiliates
prior to and after the Closing. As to any privileged attorney-client
communications between DLA Piper LLP (US) and the Company prior to the Closing
related to the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the " ** _Privileged Communications_** "), Buyer and the
Company, together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or
assigns, agree that no such party may use or rely on any of the Privileged
Communications in any action against or involving any of the parties after the
Closing.

 



 

(b) Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Company, that all privileged communications in any form or
format whatsoever between or among DLA Piper LLP (US), on the one hand, and
the Company or Seller, or any of their respective directors, officers,
employees, or other Representatives, on the other hand, that relate in any way
to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any alternative transactions to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement presented to or considered by the
Company or Seller, or any dispute arising under this Agreement, unless finally
adjudicated to be not privileged by a court of law (collectively, the " **
_Privileged Deal Communications_** "), shall remain privileged after the
Closing and that the Privileged Deal Communications and the expectation of
client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to Seller, shall be
controlled by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the
Company. Buyer agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Company not
to, (i) access

 



      
 

 



 

or use the Privileged Deal Communications, (ii) seek to have Seller waive the
attorney client privilege or any other privilege, or otherwise assert that
Buyer or the Company has the right to waive the attorney client privilege or
other privilege applicable to the Privileged Deal Communications, or (iii)
seek to obtain the Privileged Deal Communications from Seller or DLA Piper LLP
(US).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
Buyer or the Company, on the one hand, and a third party other than Seller or
its Affiliates, on the other hand, then Buyer or the Company may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Privileged Deal
Communications to such third party; provided, however, that to the extent such
dispute relates in any way to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, neither Buyer nor the Company may waive such privilege without the
prior written consent of Seller. If Buyer or the Company is legally required
by governmental order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a
portion of the Privileged Deal Communications, then Buyer shall immediately
(and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify Seller in writing
(including by making specific reference to this **_Section 12.17(d)_** so
that Seller can seek at Sellers sole cost and expense, a protective order,
and Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

 



 

(d) Seller agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that all
communications (including all privileged communications) in any form or format
whatsoever between or among DLA Piper LLP (US), on the one hand, and the
Company and any of their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates
(excluding Seller) or other Representatives, on the other hand, to the extent
they do not relate in any way to the negotiation, documentation and
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
alternative transactions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
presented to or considered by the Company or Seller, or any dispute arising
under this Agreement (collectively, the " ** _Non-Deal Communications_** "),
shall, to the extent privileged, remain privileged after the Closing and that
the Non-Deal Communications and the expectation of client confidence relating
thereto shall belong solely to the Company, shall be controlled by the Company
and shall not pass to or be claimed or retained by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (and therefore, after the Closing, Seller shall not have the right
to assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the disclosure of the Non-
Deal Communications to Buyer and the Company). Effective as of the Closing, in
connection with any representation of the Company relating to a dispute
between Buyer or the Company, on the one hand, and a third party other than
Seller or its Affiliates, on the other hand, in each case that does not relate
in any way to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller,
on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, hereby irrevocably waives and agrees
not to assert any conflict of interest arising from or in connection with DLA
Piper LLP (US)s representation of Seller and its Affiliates prior to and
after the Closing (other than for conflicts of interest that are not waivable
under applicable Rules of Professional Conduct).
