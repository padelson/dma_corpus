Accounting Principles and the Sample Statement and the Independent Accounting Firm is not to make any other determination, including
any determination as to whether the Target Net Working Capital or any estimates on the Preliminary Closing Statement are correct,
adequate or sufficient. In resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either
party. The Independent Accounting Firm&rsquo;s determination of the Closing Net Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses shall be based solely on written materials submitted by the Buyer and the Seller (i.e.,
not on independent review). The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties
hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or further review absent fraud or manifest error. Judgment may be entered upon the written
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in accordance with Section 9.9. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent
Accounting Firm will be entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator.</P>
