binding upon the Parties without further recourse or collateral attack;

together. If the Neutral Auditor determines that Sellers shall bear such
costs each Seller shall bear its Allocable Portion. For purposes of the

to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to permit Buyer
or its representatives to have access to any personnel, books, records,

Agreement without any liability to Sellers by providing written notice of

Buyer, then Buyer may elect to waive any such breach or breaches (or portion
of such breaches) sufficient to make the Cost of Curing all such non-waived
breaches no greater than $20,000,000. In such case, Buyer shall notify
Sellers that Buyer desires to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by providing written notice to Sellers of such
election, within the earlier to occur of the second Business Day immediately

case, Sellers and the Company shall be obligated, subject to the other terms
and conditions of this Agreement, to consummate the transactions contemplated
in this Agreement and Sellers shall not be entitled to any remedy pursuant to
§8 of this Agreement for any Adverse Consequences arising from or related to

liability to Sellers, except as provided in §5(e)(xi) below, by providing
written notice of such election to Sellers and (y) Sellers shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement without any liability to Buyer by providing

breaches (or portion of such breach) sufficient to make the Cost of Curing
all such non-waived

  



  

34   

     
   

  



  

breaches no greater than $20,000,000. In such case, Sellers shall notify Buyer
that Sellers desire to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by providing written notice to Buyer of such election, within the
earlier to occur of the second Business Day immediately prior to the then
scheduled Closing Date or 10 Business Days of receipt of the written notice

Days after notice of such breach, the estimated Cost of Curing such breach
shall be determined by a mutually agreed upon Person experienced in the area
at issue (an " _Expert_ "). Buyer and Sellers shall direct the Expert
to determine the estimated Cost of Curing no later than the second Business
Day immediately preceding the then scheduled Closing Date. In the event the
Cost of Curing any breach or potential breach by a Party pursuant to this
Agreement cannot be determined or reasonably estimated on or prior to the
Closing Date, then, subject to the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Closing Date shall be automatically extended until the last
Business Day of the immediately following month to permit such determination.

  



  

(x) The Expert shall resolve all issues related to the Cost of Curing after
the Closing. If Buyer and Sellers previously determined the estimated Cost of
Curing to be placed in escrow in good faith without any Expert, Buyer and
Sellers shall appoint an Expert at or prior to Closing to act in accordance
with this §5(e)(x). If any amount is deposited into either the Pre-Closing
Buyer Escrow Fund or the Pre-Closing Seller Escrow Fund, within ten (10) days
after the Closing Date, Buyer and Sellers may make a written presentation of

appropriate.  Within ten (10) days after submission of such facts, documents
and written presentations, the Expert shall resolve all disputed items in
writing and shall prepare and deliver its decision, which shall be final and
binding upon the Parties without further recourse or collateral attack and
shall constitute a Final Determination of such dispute; provided that the
Expert shall not assign a value to any particular disputed item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by Buyer or Sellers or less that the

fees) shall be borne by the Party (that is, either Buyer or Sellers jointly)

Sellers shall bear such costs each Seller shall bear its Allocable Portion.
If a Pre-Closing Buyer Escrow Fund is established, disbursements shall be
made from such fund to Buyer to reimburse Buyer for any Adverse Consequences
resulting from or arising out of such breach. Any proceeds remaining in
the Pre-Closing Buyer Escrow Fund following such reimbursement of Buyer shall
be disbursed to Sellers. If a Pre-Closing Sellers Escrow Fund is
established, disbursements shall be made from such fund to Sellers to
reimburse Sellers for any Adverse Consequences resulting from or arising out
of such breach. Any proceeds remaining in the Pre-Closing Sellers Escrow Fund
following such reimbursement of Sellers shall be disbursed to Buyer.

exclusive remedy for any breach of another Partys representations,
warranties or covenants that is disclosed to the other Parties by written
notice pursuant to §5(e)(i), §5(e)(ii) or §5(e)(iii) above, other than for

Party actively is contesting or defending against any Proceeding (other than
any in which Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, are

by such Seller to Buyer (determined in accordance with the Final Allocation

giving effect to any extension).

  



  

(d) _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(i) Subject to applicable Law and all agreements and other arrangements with
the Companys employees, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, for a
period of twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, provide salary and
benefits to employees of the Company who continue to be employed by the
Company immediately after the Closing Date ("Continuing Employees"),
including participation in the Companys Employee Benefit Plans (or
comparable Buyer Benefit Plans), which will be no less favorable (taken as a
whole) to those currently provided by the Company to its similarly
situated employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) any Continuing
Employee who resigns his or her employment, dies or terminates

  



  

37   

     
   

  



  

his or her employment as a result of disability prior to the first
anniversary of the Closing Date shall not be entitled to any salary or
benefits attributable to the period following the effective date of the
termination of his employment (" _Termination Date_ "), except as otherwise
provided in any written agreement between such Continuing Employee and the
Company, (B) no Continuing Employee whose employment with the Company is
terminated prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date shall be
eligible to participate in any Employee Benefit Plan of the Company or any of
its Affiliates that is intended to be qualified under Code § 401(a)
(a "Qualified Plan") with respect to any period following his or her
Termination Date, (C) in the event that a particular Employee Benefit Plan
(other than a Qualified Plan) does not permit the participation of the
Continuing Employee due to the termination of his or her employment, with
respect to the Companys agreement under this paragraph to continue such
Continuing Employees participation in such Employee Benefit Plan until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company shall pay such Continuing
Employee an amount equal to the then monthly out-of-pocket cost to the
Company of providing such Continuing Employee coverage under such Employee
Benefit Plan multiplied by the number of whole months between such Continuing
Employees Termination Date and the first anniversary of the Closing Date.
 Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this §6(d)(i), in the case of
any Continuing Employee who is party to an agreement providing for
severance or change of control benefits in the event of the termination of
his or her employment with the Company or any of its Affiliates following the
Closing Date, such Continuing Employee shall be entitled to receive the more
valuable of the payments and other benefits provided for under this paragraph
(in the aggregate) or the payments and benefits provided for under such
agreement (in the aggregate) but no Continuing Employee shall be entitled to
claim benefits under both this paragraph and such agreement or in part under
this paragraph and in part under such agreement. Any benefits provided to a
terminated Continuing Employee under this paragraph under any Employee
Benefit Plan that constitutes a "group health plan" within the meaning of
Code § 5000(b)(1) shall count towards the Companys obligation to make
continuation coverage available to such Continuing Employee pursuant to Code
§ 4980B(f) and ERISA §§ 601-608. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions
of this §6(d)(i), Buyer and the Company shall comply with the
applicable provisions of the Employee Benefit Plans, ERISA and the Code with
respect to each Continuing Employee.

  



  

 **(ii) **After Closing, Buyer shall cause the Company to, satisfy all post-
Closing obligations of the Company pursuant to any written employment,
severance, profits participation or other employee compensation plan adopted
by the Company or any agreements between the Company and any employee of the
Company. To the extent that the employees of the Company become eligible to
participate in any Employee Benefit Plans or programs that Buyer or the
Company implement on or after the Closing Date (each a " _Buyer Benefit Plan_
"), then for all purposes (including, without limitation, determining
eligibility to participate, vesting under plans, early retirement and benefit
accrual), service with the Company shall be treated as service under such
Buyer Benefit Plan, in as similar a manner as practicable; provided, however
that such service need not be recognized as benefit service (A) under any
Buyer Benefit Plan which is a qualified defined benefit pension plan or (B)
to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of
benefits. All Buyer Benefit Plans shall waive any pre-existing
conditions, actively-at-work exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation by and coverage of the employees and their eligible dependents
and, with respect to the 2005 calendar year, shall

  



  

38   

     
   

  



  

provide that any expenses incurred on or before Closing by or on behalf of
any such individuals shall be taken into account under the applicable Buyer
Benefit Plans for purposes of satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance
and maximum out-of-pocket provisions _._

  



  

(iii) For a period of ten (10) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (A)
maintain in effect the current provisions regarding indemnification of any of
the Companys members, managers, officers, agents and employees (" _Covered
Persons_ ") contained in the LLC Agreement, and (B) indemnify the Covered
Persons to the fullest extent to which Buyer is permitted to indemnify
current or former members, managers, officers, directors, agents or employees
under its certificate of incorporation, certificate of organization, bylaws,
limited liability company agreement, operating agreement or other
organizational documents and applicable Law.

  



  

(e) _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(i) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed any required Tax Returns for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods with respect
to the Company. Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by Sellers in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Section and any audit, litigation or
other Proceeding, including the retention of books and records relevant to
any such Tax Returns until Sellers notice to Buyer of the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations (or any extension), and make employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided hereunder.

  



  

(ii) Sellers shall pay to Buyer (or Buyer shall pay to Sellers) the amount by
which Taxes attributable to the portion of such Pre-Closing Period ending on
the Closing Date exceed (or are less than) any reserve for Tax Liability for
such Taxes included in the calculation of Net Working Capital as of the
Closing Date. Any such payment by Sellers to Buyer (or by Buyer to Sellers)
under this §6(e)(ii) shall be made within fifteen (15) days after the date on
which Taxes are paid with respect to such Pre-Closing Periods. For purposes
of this §6(e)(ii), in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic
basis and are payable for a Taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax which relates to the portion of
such Taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
Taxable period. Any credits relating to a Pre-Closing Period that begins
before and ends after the Closing Date shall be allocated so that a portion
of such credits that relate to the portion of a Taxable period ending on the
Closing Date are allocated to the Pre-Closing Period. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Company.

  



  

(iii) Any information shared in connection with Taxes shall be kept
confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or reports, tax audits, tax claims and tax litigation,
or as required by Law.

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

(iv) Buyer shall provide prompt written notice to Sellers of any pending or
threatened tax audit, assessment or Proceeding that it becomes aware of
related to the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Such notice shall
contain factual information (to the extent known) describing the asserted tax
adjustment, assessment, Proceeding or Liability in reasonable detail and
shall be accompanied by copies of any notice or other document received from
or with any tax authority in respect of any such matters. Sellers shall
control audits and disputes related to such Taxes due or Tax matters for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (including action taken to pay, compromise or settle
such Taxes or Tax matters). Buyer and the Company and their Affiliates shall
provide Sellers and their Affiliates with such powers of attorney or other
authorizing documentation as are reasonably necessary to empower them to
execute and file Pre-Closing Tax Returns, file refund and equivalent claims
for Taxes related to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and contest, settle, and
resolve any related audits and disputes (including any refund claims or
amended Tax Returns which result in audits or disputes).

  



  

(v) If Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including the Company) receives a
refund of any Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, Buyer or such
Affiliate receiving such refund shall, within ten (10) days after receipt of
such refund, remit it to Sellers in accordance with their Allocable Portions.

  



  

(vi) The Parties respective obligations pursuant to this §6(e) shall survive
until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (after giving
effect to any extensions).

  



  

(f) _Company Confidential_ _Information_.For a period of two years following
the **** Closing, none of Jay A. Precourt, Frederic C. Hamilton or Sellers
shall, directly or indirectly, disclose or permit any Affiliate, directly or
indirectly, to disclose to any Person any confidential information of the
Company, unless compelled to disclose by any applicable Law, except to the
extent that such information can be shown to have been (i) in the public
domain through no fault of Jay A. Precourt, Frederic C. Hamilton or Sellers
or any of their Affiliates or (ii) lawfully acquired by Jay A. Precourt,
Frederic C. Hamilton or Sellers after the Closing Date on a non-confidential
basis from sources other than Buyer or the Company or any of their
Affiliates, but only to the extent that any such source is not bound by a
confidentiality agreement or other duty to keep such information
confidential.

  



  

(g) _Financial Sta_ _tements_. Each  Seller shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in preparing financial statements of the
Company in such form and covering such periods as may be required by any
applicable securities laws to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission by Buyer as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the independent public accountants of the Company to provide any consent
necessary to the filing of such financial statements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and to provide such customary representation letters as
are necessary in connection therewith.

  



  

(h) _Right to N_ _ame_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing
(and in any event, within 30 days after the Closing Date) Sellers will, and
will cause each of their Affiliates to, remove the name "ScissorTail"
(and all derivations therefrom), and all trademarks, trade names and symbols
related thereto from the properties and assets of Sellers and their
Affiliates. Within

  



  

40

contained in clause (i) above to be reasonable, if a final determination is
made by an arbitration panel selected in accordance with §10(j) that the time

unenforceable restriction against the Non-Competition Parties under

determine or indicate to be reasonable.

its covenants contained in this Agreement, provided that Buyer or any of its
Affiliates makes a written Claim for Indemnification against such Seller
within any applicable survival period and pursuant to the notice provisions
of §10(h), then such Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates from and
against any Adverse Consequences Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including
the Company) shall suffer through and after the date of the Claim for
Indemnification resulting from or arising out of such breach subject to the
applicable limitations of this §8.

  



  

(iii) Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer or its Affiliates
pursuant to §8(b)(i) until Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company)
has suffered Adverse Consequences by reason of all such breaches in excess of
$5,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), after which point Sellers will be obligated
to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates only from and against further Adverse
Consequences in excess of such Threshold.

  



  

(iv) No amount shall be payable pursuant to §8(b)(i) with respect to any
matter or series of related matters resulting in Adverse Consequences to
Buyer or its Affiliates of $100,000 or less; provided that such Adverse
Consequences shall be included in calculating the Threshold.

  



  

45   

     
   

  



  

(v) Each Sellers obligation to indemnify Buyer pursuant to §8(b)(ii) from
and against any breach of a covenant made by both Sellers or the Company
(other than pursuant to §2(a), §6(f), §6(g) or §6(i)) shall be limited to
such Sellers Allocable Portion of any Adverse Consequences Buyer shall
suffer through and after the date of the Claim for Indemnification and may
not be increased under any circumstances.

  



  

(vi) Sellers shall have no obligation to indemnify Buyer or its Affiliates
pursuant to §8(b)(i) by reason of any breaches of the Companys
representations and warranties set forth in §4(d) and 4(r) of this Agreement
until the Company has exhausted all remedies available to it under the
Expanded Policy, the Duke Agreement and the Octagon Agreement (the "Primary
Remedies").  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Buyers
rights to pursue a Claim for Indemnification for the Companys breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in §4(d) and 4(r) shall
survive during the time Buyer or its Affiliates are actively pursuing the
Primary Remedies and for the period thereafter required to bring any related
Claim for Indemnification against Sellers, so long as Buyer has provided
notice of its potential Claim for Indemnification (and the assertion of its
Primary Remedies) to Sellers within twelve (12) months after the Closing
Date.

  



  

(vii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Escrow
Amount shall be the sole and exclusive source of funds available to Buyer
with respect to any Claim for Indemnification made after the Closing arising
pursuant to §8(b)(i), and after distribution to Buyer of the entire Escrow
Amount, Sellers will have no obligation to further indemnify Buyer from and
against such Adverse Consequences.

  



  

(c) _Indemnification P_ _rovisions for Sellers  Benefit_. In the
event Buyer breaches any of its representations, warranties, or covenants
contained in this Agreement, and, provided that any Seller or any of its
Affiliates makes a written Claim for Indemnification against Buyer pursuant
to the notice provisions of §10(h) within any applicable survival period,
then Buyer shall indemnify each Seller and its Affiliates from and against
any Adverse Consequences Sellers or any of its Affiliates shall suffer
through and after the date of the Claim for Indemnification resulting from or
arising out of the breach subject to the applicable limitations of this §8.

  



  

(d) _Matters Involv_ _ing Third Parties_. (i) If any third party shall
notify any Party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") with respect to any matter (a
" _Third Party Claim_ ") which may give rise to a Claim for Indemnification
against any other Party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") under this §8, then
the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each Indemnifying Party thereof
in writing; _provided, however_ , that no delay on the part of the
Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any obligation under this Agreement unless (and then
solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.

  



  

(ii) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right to defend the Indemnified
Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (A) the Third Party Claim
involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or other
equitable relief and, in respect of Third Party Claims in which Buyer or its
Affiliates is the Indemnified Party, in Buyers reasonable judgment could not
result in money damages in excess of any remaining Escrow Amount, (B)
settlement of, or an adverse

  



  

46   

     
   

  



  

judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith
judgment of the Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedential custom
or practice materially adverse to the continuing business interests of the
Indemnified Party, and (C) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the
Third Party Claim actively and diligently.

  



  

(iii) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the
Third Party Claim in accordance with §8(d)(ii), (A) the Indemnified Party may
retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in
the defense of the Third Party Claim, (B) the Indemnified Party will not
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld unreasonably), and (C)
the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably).

  



  

(iv) In the event any of the conditions in §8(d)(ii) is or becomes
unsatisfied, however, (A) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it may deem appropriate
subject to the consent of the Indemnifying Party in the case of any proposed
entry of a judgment or settlement, (B) the Indemnifying Parties will have
sixty (60) days from the receipt of any notice under §8(d)(i) to cure to the
Indemnified Partys satisfaction the subject matter of the notice, and, in
the absence of such a timely, satisfactory cure, the Indemnifying Parties
will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the costs
of defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable attorneys
fees and expenses), and (C) the Indemnifying Parties will remain responsible
for any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting from,
arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third Party
Claim to the fullest extent provided in this §8.

  



  

(e) _Matters not In_ _volving Third Party Claims_. Buyer or Sellers may make
a claim for any matter that does not involve a Third Party Claim in any
amount to which they may be entitled under this §8 by providing a Claim
for Indemnification against the other promptly after such Indemnified Party
has notice of any Adverse Consequence which may give rise to a Claim
for Indemnification; _provided, however_ , that no delay on the part of
Buyer or Sellers in notifying the other shall relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any obligation hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such delay. The Indemnifying
Party shall have thirty (30) days to object to the Claim for Indemnification
by delivery of a written notice of such objection to the Indemnified Party
specifying in reasonable detail the basis for such objection. Failure to
timely respond shall constitute a final and binding acceptance of the Claim
for Indemnification by the Indemnifying Party, and the Claim for
Indemnification shall be paid in accordance with §8(g). If an objection is
timely interposed by the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good faith for a period of twenty
(20) Business Days from the date the Indemnified Party receives
such objection prior to commencing any arbitration, formal legal action, suit
or proceeding with respect to such Claim for Indemnification.

  



  

(f) _Claims Against Escro_ _w Amount_. Subject to this §8, any Claim
for Indemnification by Buyer against Sellers pursuant to §8(b)(i) shall
be made solely with respect to the Escrow

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

Amount and may be made at any time within the applicable survival
period. Upon any Final Determination (as defined below) of a Claim for
Indemnification against Sellers, Sellers and Buyer shall provide joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer the amount of such
Claim for Indemnification as determined by such Final Determination. Upon the
expiration of the applicable survival period without any pending claims, the
remaining balance of the Escrow Amount will be disbursed by the Escrow Agent
(pursuant to joint written instructions by Sellers and Buyer) to Sellers in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement; _provided, however_ , that in the
event that there are any pending Claims for Indemnification at the time of
such expiration: (i) the claimed amounts shall remain in escrow; (ii)
the remaining balance of the Escrow Amount after such retention will be
so disbursed by Escrow Agent (pursuant to joint written instructions by
Sellers and Buyer) to Sellers in accordance with the Escrow Agreement; and
(iii) as each such Claim for Indemnification is resolved by a Final
Determination, any amount retained with respect thereto that remains in
escrow after such resolution will be disbursed by Escrow Agent (pursuant to
joint written instructions by Sellers and Buyer) to Sellers in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(g) _Payment_ _of Claims_. Upon Final Determination of the amount of a Claim
for Indemnification, the Indemnifying Party (or the Escrow Agent, if
applicable) shall pay the amount of such claim within ten (10) days of the
date of such Final Determination. A "Final Determination" of a claim shall be
(i) a judgment of any court determining the validity or amount of a disputed
claim, if no appeal is pending from such judgment or if the time to appeal
therefrom has elapsed (it being understood that the Indemnified Party
shall have no obligation to appeal); (ii) an award of any arbitrator
or arbitration panel determining the validity or amount of such disputed
claim, if there is not pending any motion to set aside such award or if the
time within which to move to set such award aside has elapsed; (iii) a
written termination of the dispute with respect to such claim signed by all
of the parties thereto or their attorneys; (iv) a written acknowledgment of
the Indemnifying Party that it does not dispute the validity or amount of
such claim; (v) a failure by an Indemnifying Party to respond to a Claim
for Indemnification by the date specified in §8(e); or (vi) such
other evidence of final determination of a disputed claim as shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Parties.

  



  

(h) _Determination of_ _Adverse Consequences_. All indemnification payments
under this §8 shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party net of any
Tax benefits, insurance coverage and other indemnification rights that
are available to the Indemnified Party and shall be computed on a present
value basis (using the Applicable Rate as the discount rate). All
indemnification payments under this §8 shall be deemed adjustments to the
Purchase Price.

  



  

(i) _Exclusive Re_ _medy_. **EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO BREACHES OF
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS DISCLOSED PRIOR TO CLOSING AS
PROVIDED IN §5(E), BUYER, THE COMPANY AND SELLERS ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT
THE FOREGOING INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS §8 SHALL BE THE EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY OF BUYER, THE COMPANY AND SELLERS WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND
THE EVENTS GIVING RISE THERETO AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. BUYER, THE COMPANY AND EACH SELLER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER IT,
NOR ANY SUCCESSOR OR ASSIGN,**

  



  

48   

     
   

  



  

 **SHALL HAVE ANY RIGHTS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTIES OR ITS AFFILIATES
WITH RESPECT TO THE TRANSACTIONS PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT OTHER THAN AS
IS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT.**

  



  

(j) _Limitation on_ _Damages_ **. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN
THIS AGREEMENT, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY, ANY SELLER OR BUYER BE LIABLE
TO THE OTHER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, REMOTE,
SPECULATIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR LOSS
OF PROFITS.**

  



  

 **§ 9. Termination**.

  



  

(a) _Termination of_ _Agreement_. Certain of the Parties may terminate
this Agreement as follows:

  



  

(i) Buyer and each Seller may terminate this Agreement by mutual written
consent at any time prior to Closing;

  



  

(ii) Buyer or Sellers may terminate this Agreement as provided by §5(e);

  



  

(iii) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to Sellers
at any time prior to Closing if Closing shall not have occurred on or before
August 31, 2005 (unless the failure results primarily from Buyer itself
breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this
Agreement); and

  



  

(iv) Either Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
Buyer at any time prior to Closing if Closing shall not have occurred on or
before August 31, 2005 (unless the failure results primarily from the Company
or a Seller breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in
this Agreement).

  



  

(b) _Effect of Te_ _rmination_. If any Party terminates this
Agreement pursuant to §9(a), all rights and obligations of the applicable
Parties under this Agreement shall terminate without any Liability of any
Party to any other Party (except for any Liability of any Party then in
breach); _provided, however_ , that the confidentiality provisions contained
in §5(d) shall survive termination.

  



  

 **§ 10. Miscellaneous.**

  



  

(a) _Nature of Sellers  __Obligations_.

  



  

(i) The covenants of each Seller in §2(a) concerning the sale of its
Membership Interests to Buyer, the representations and warranties of each
Seller in §3(a) and the covenants contained in §6(f), (g) or (i) are
individual and not joint or several obligations. This means that the
particular Seller making the representation, warranty, or covenant shall
be solely responsible to the extent provided in §5(e) and §8(b) for
any Adverse Consequences Buyer may suffer as a result of any breach thereof.

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

(ii) The remainder of Sellers representations, warranties, and covenants in

in §5(e) and §8(b).

  



  

(b) _Press Releases and Pu_ _blic Announcements_. No Party shall issue any
press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter
of this Agreement prior to Closing without the prior written approval of
Buyer and Sellers; provided, however, that any Party may make any public
disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable Law or any
listing or trading agreement concerning its publicly traded securities (in
which case the disclosing Party will use its commercially reasonable efforts
to advise the other Parties prior to making the disclosure).

  



  

(c) _No Third-Party Be_ _neficiaries_. Except for the rights conferred on the
Companys employees and Covered Persons pursuant to §6(d) of this Agreement,
this Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other

with respect to the rights conferred pursuant to §6(d), any remedies shall
be limited to actual damages and not punitive or consequential damages.

  



  

(d) _Entire Ag_ _reement_. This Agreement (including the Escrow Agreement and
the other documents referred to in this Agreement) and the
Confidentiality Agreement dated March 24, 2005 among the Parties constitute

of this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Succession a_ _nd Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties named in this Agreement and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. No Party may assign either this
Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations under
this Agreement without the prior written approval of Buyer and Sellers. A
reference to a Party to this Agreement or another agreement or document
includes the Partys successors and assigns.

  



  

(f) _Counterpar_ _ts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts (including by means of facsimile), each of which shall be
deemed an original but all of which together will constitute one and the
