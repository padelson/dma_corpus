and Sale</U>. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Seller agrees to sell to
Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Seller, on the Closing Date, the Shares. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION&nbsp;2.02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Purchase
Price</U>. The aggregate purchase price for the Shares (and&nbsp;the limited non-compete set forth in
Section&nbsp;5.08) shall be $225,000,000 (the&nbsp;"<U>Purchase Price</U>"), of which (i)&nbsp;$225,000,000 <U>minus</U> the Holdback Amount shall be
paid in cash to Seller on the Closing Date as provided in Section&nbsp;2.03(c)&nbsp;and&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;the Holdback Amount shall be paid in accordance with and at the times set forth in the
Holdback Agreement or the Holdback Guarantee, as the case may be. Within 30&nbsp;days after Closing, Seller will provide Purchaser with an allocation of the Purchase Price (less the $2,000,000
allocated pursuant to Section&nbsp;5.08 hereof) among MECPenn, MLR, WTA and the Subsidiaries for approval, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. The parties agree that such allocation shall
be binding and the parties shall not take a position that is inconsistent with such allocation in any matter. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION&nbsp;2.03&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Closing</U>.
(a)&nbsp;Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Shares contemplated
hereby shall take place at a closing (the&nbsp;"<U>Closing</U>") to be held at 10:00&nbsp;a.m., Los Angeles time, no later than two Business Days after the last of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Sections&nbsp;8.01, 8.02&nbsp;and 8.03&nbsp;has been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing
Date) ("<U>Satisfaction Date</U>"); <U>provided</U>, that so long as Purchaser needs additional time in order to obtain the bridge financing for the
Purchase Price less the Holdback Amount (the&nbsp;"<U>Closing Extension</U>") and so long as Purchaser is using its best efforts towards obtaining such financing and Closing,
the Closing shall be held no later than four weeks after the last of such conditions to Closing has been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the
Closing Date). In the event that the Closing Extension occurs and at the end of the Closing Extension, the last of the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections&nbsp;8.01, 8.02&nbsp;and
8.03&nbsp;has been satisfied (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date), and Purchaser fails to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby, then
Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement. In the event that the Closing Extension occurs and events take place after the Satisfaction Date that cause one or more conditions to Closing
to not be satisfied at the end of the Closing Extension (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date), then the party that has the right not to close as a
result of such condition or conditions not being so satisfied shall, within two Business Days after the end of the Closing Extension, either waive all such conditions and proceed to Closing or
terminate this Agreement; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that such right to not close due to such events or due to such condition(s)&nbsp;not being
satisfied and such right to terminate this Agreement shall not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted
in, such events or such condition(s)&nbsp;not being satisfied. The Closing will occur at the offices of O'Melveny&nbsp;&amp; Myers&nbsp;LLP, 400&nbsp;South Hope, Los Angeles, California, or at
such other time or on such other date or at such other place as Seller and Purchaser may mutually agree upon in writing (the&nbsp;day on which the Closing takes place being the

law). When each Transaction Document to which Seller is or will be a party has been duly executed and delivered by Seller (assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by each other party
thereto), such Transaction Document will constitute a legal and binding obligation of Seller enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy,

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchaser
and Seller each will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly make available or file with the Gaming Board such information as it or its staff may
request under the Gaming Act. Purchaser and Seller will, not later than December&nbsp;20, 2005 (or&nbsp;two weeks before such other date as the Gaming Board may select for submission of
applications so long as filing on such later date does not provide an advantage to other applicants or is otherwise detrimental to the Companies' application or to their right to timely obtain a
Conditional Category&nbsp;1 license or Category&nbsp;1 license for gaming from the Gaming Board), file with the Gaming Board the application for Conditional Category&nbsp;1 license as required
by the Gaming Act (the&nbsp;"<U>Gaming Application</U>"). The Gaming Application will be drafted to reflect two different scenarios&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;one
in which Purchaser is the operator and owner of the Meadows Facility and the operator of the gaming operations with an Affiliate of Seller serving as a manager of the racing operations of the Meadows
Facility (such scenario, the "<U>Transaction Scenario</U>") and one in which Seller or one or more of its Affiliates is the operator and owner of the Meadows Facility
(the&nbsp;"<U>Alternative Scenario</U>"). In addition, both Purchaser and Seller shall furnish to the Gaming Board such other information, financial statements and other
documentation as the Gaming Board requires concerning Purchaser or Seller and will make available representatives of Purchaser or Seller to meet with the Gaming Board, or its staff, to expedite the
ability of the Gaming Board to complete its work. For the avoidance of doubt, while Purchaser and Seller will both use reasonable efforts to accomplish the matters set forth in this Section and to
assemble such application, Purchaser shall be responsible for all items with respect to the Gaming Application other than the MEC Items. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
of Purchaser and Seller agrees to use its best efforts to complete the Gaming Application for submission to the Gaming Board on or before December&nbsp;20, 2005,
and agrees to have a weekly scheduled telephone call or meeting at which the individuals with responsibility for organizing each of the Purchaser's and Seller's efforts in connection with the filing
of the Gaming Application review and discuss the progress being made to complete the Gaming Application. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;Either
party shall notify the other upon becoming aware that the Gaming Board may consider, identify or support an Action that could jeopardize Seller's ability to
obtain a Conditional Category&nbsp;1 license or Category&nbsp;1 license in its own name if Seller continues to pursue a Conditional Category&nbsp;1 license or a Category&nbsp;1 license with
Purchaser. Prior to the termination of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser agree not to take any action that could reasonably be expected to impede the consideration of the Gaming Application for the
Transaction Scenario (it&nbsp;being acknowledged that Seller's exercise of its rights under Section&nbsp;5.15 or&nbsp;Seller's or Purchaser's exercise of rights under Section&nbsp;10.01 shall
not be considered an action that constitutes a breach of the obligations set forth in this sentence). Prior to the termination of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser agree to use their best efforts,
and continue to use their best efforts, to permit Seller and Purchaser to jointly pursue the Gaming Application for the Transaction Scenario (it&nbsp;being acknowledged that Seller's exercise of its
rights under Section&nbsp;5.15 or&nbsp;Seller's or Purchaser's exercise of rights under Section&nbsp;10.01 shall not be considered an action that constitutes a breach of the obligations set
forth in this sentence). Seller agrees to make itself available to participate in meetings, appearances and hearings to assist in the joint efforts of Seller and Purchaser to pursue the Gaming
Application for the Transaction Scenario. </FONT></P>

attempting to make such estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, that Purchaser is familiar with such uncertainties and that Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making its own

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seller,

injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further or continued breach of violation of such covenant. Such right to an injunction shall be cumulative, and in addition to,
and not in lieu of, any other remedies to which Purchaser may show itself justly entitled. Further, during any period in which Seller or any of its Affiliates are in breach of the
Non-Competition Covenant, the time period of such covenant shall be extended for an amount of time that Seller or any of its Affiliates are in breach hereof, with the effect that the total
duration of the Non-Competition Covenant shall be the original period plus the actual amount of time that Seller or any of its Affiliates are in breach. </FONT></P>

Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that the Non-Competition Covenant is appropriate and reasonable when considered in light of the nature
and extent of the business conducted by Purchaser. Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that: (i)&nbsp;Purchaser would not enter into this Agreement unless Seller, for
itself and its Affiliates, agreed to the Non-Competition Covenant; and (ii)&nbsp;it has read and understands the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
Non-Competition Covenant, and has been provided the opportunity to discuss this Agreement and such covenant with Purchaser and counsel of its choice and has carefully considered the nature
and extent of the restrictions upon it and the rights and remedies conferred upon Purchaser hereunder. Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, hereby acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser has a
legitimate interest in protecting its business and that the Non-Competition Covenant is reasonable in limitations as to time, scope, geographical area and activity, and is fully required
and is no greater than necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Purchaser. Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, further agrees that the Non-Competition Covenant is not
unduly harsh or oppressive to Seller, or any of its Affiliates, in curtailing their legitimate efforts to earn a livelihood and does not stifle the inherent skill and experience of Seller, or any of
its Affiliates, or confer a benefit upon Purchaser disproportionate to the detriment to Seller, or any of its Affiliates, or harm in any manner whatsoever the public interest or operate as a bar to
the sole means of support of Seller, or any of its Affiliates. </FONT></P>

Company Employee who was covered by the health plan listed on Section&nbsp;6.02 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the&nbsp;"<U>MEC Health Plan</U>") shall cease to be
covered by such health plan. Seller agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to create a separate employee plan in the name of Purchaser to provide to such Company Employees substantially similar
benefits to those provided for under the MEC Health Plan, except in instances where the benefit cannot be replicated because of the different provider. Seller shall remain obligated for any and all
benefits and benefit entitlements under the Benefit Plans that were earned or accrued by any Company Employee or any Transferred Employee or former employees of any Company or Subsidiary on and prior
to the Closing Date. With respect to the Benefit Plans that provide welfare benefits, Seller represents, warrants and agrees that there will be no disruption in the coverage for the Transferred
Employees under such welfare plans as a result of their transfer to MEC Pennsylvania Racing Services,&nbsp;Inc. To the extent that there is a termination in coverage under the MEC Health Plan for
the Company Employees covered thereby as of the Closing Date, Seller represents, warrants and agrees that either it or the applicable insurance carrier, as set forth in the MEC Health Plan, shall
remain obligated to reimburse such Company Employees for eligible health care benefit expenses and services incurred prior to the Closing; <U>provided</U> that such Company
Employees' claims for reimbursement for such expenses and services are delivered to the appropriate party within applicable time limits, as set forth in the MEC Health Plan. An expense or service is
deemed to be incurred, with respect to the MEC Health Plan, when the medical services are performed, and, with respect to plans that provide welfare benefits other than medical or dental benefits,
when the event giving rise to such expense or service occurs. </FONT></P>

Any Tax refund (including any interest with respect thereto), and any equivalent benefit through a reduction in tax
liability for a post-Closing Date period, relating to the Companies or any Subsidiary for any taxable period prior to the Closing Date shall be the property of Seller, and if received by
Purchaser or the Companies or any Subsidiary shall be paid over to Seller within five Business Days of the earlier of receipt or entitlement thereto; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that any Tax benefit obtained by Purchaser, the Companies or any Subsidiary as a result of utilizing any net operating loss carryforward or other carryforward
(which may be subject to adjustments) which is allocable to the Companies or any Subsidiary shall be retained by Purchaser, the Companies or such Subsidiary. Purchaser shall cause the Companies and
the Subsidiaries to elect, where permitted by law, to carry forward any net operating loss, charitable contribution or other item arising after the Closing Date that could, in the absence of such
election, be carried back to a taxable period of the Companies ending on or before the Closing Date in which the Companies are included in a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax return; provided
that, if such election to carry forward an item is not available, any cash refund received by Seller with respect to such carryback shall be paid over to Purchaser within five Business Days of actual
receipt. Purchaser shall, if Seller so requests and at Seller's expense, cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any refunds or equivalent amounts to which Seller is entitled under this
Section&nbsp;7.03. Purchaser shall permit Seller to control (at&nbsp;Seller's expense) the prosecution of any such refund claim, and shall cause the relevant entity to authorize by appropriate
power of attorney such persons as Seller shall designate to represent such entity with respect to such refund claim; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that
Seller shall not take any action in the prosecution of such refund claims that would be materially detrimental to Purchaser, the Companies or the Subsidiaries (including for this purpose the tax
positions of such entities). In the event that any refund or credit of Taxes for which a payment has been made to Seller pursuant to this Section&nbsp;7.03 is subsequently reduced or disallowed,
Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the payor for any Tax Liability, including interest and penalties assessed against such payor by reason of the reduction or disallowance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION&nbsp;7.04&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Contests</U>.
(a)&nbsp;After the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon the commencement of any Tax
audit or administrative or judicial proceeding that could affect Seller, and shall also separately notify Seller, in writing, of a proposed assessment or claim in an audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding of Purchaser or of any of the Companies and the Subsidiaries which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be grounds for indemnification under this Article&nbsp;VII. If
Purchaser fails to give Seller prompt notice of an asserted Tax liability as required by this Section&nbsp;7.04, then (a)&nbsp;if Seller is precluded by the failure to give notice within
30&nbsp;days of the commencement of such proceeding from contesting the asserted Tax liability in both the administrative and judicial forums, then Purchaser shall have sole responsibility for such
Tax liability or (b)&nbsp;if Seller is not precluded from contesting but such failure to give notice within 30&nbsp;days of the commencement of such proceeding results in detriment to Seller, then
any amount that Seller is otherwise required to pay to Purchaser pursuant to Section&nbsp;7.01 with respect to such liability shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment. </FONT></P>

may elect to direct, through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense, any audit, claim for refund and administrative or judicial proceeding involving
any asserted liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought under this Article&nbsp;VII (any&nbsp;such audit, claim for refund or proceeding relating to an asserted tax liability are
referred to herein collectively as a "<U>Contest</U>"). If Seller elects to direct the Contest of an asserted Tax liability, it shall within 30&nbsp;days of receipt of the
notice of asserted tax liability notify Purchaser of its intent to do so, and Purchaser shall cooperate and shall cause each Subsidiary and any successor to a Subsidiary or its successor to cooperate,
at Seller's expense, in each phase of such Contest. Purchaser also may participate in any such audit or proceeding and, if Seller does not assume the defense of any such audit or proceeding, Purchaser
may defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such audit or proceeding after giving five Business Days' prior written notice to Seller setting
forth the terms and conditions of settlement. In the event that issues relating to a potential adjustment for which Seller would be liable are required to be dealt with in the same proceeding as
separate issues relating to a potential adjustment for which Purchaser would be liable, Purchaser shall have the right, at its expense, to control the audit or proceeding with respect to the latter
issues. If Seller chooses to direct the Contest, Purchaser shall promptly empower and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiary or its successor promptly to empower (by&nbsp;power of attorney and such
other documentation as may be appropriate) such representatives of Seller as it may designate to represent Purchaser or the Subsidiary or its successor in the Contest insofar as the Contest involves
an asserted tax liability for which Seller would be liable under this Article&nbsp;VII. If Seller assumes the defense of a Contest, Seller shall not enter into any compromise or agree to settle any
claim pursuant to any Tax audit or proceeding which would adversely affect Purchaser for any taxable year without the written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. </FONT></P>

Date for which Seller is responsible under Sections&nbsp;7.01(a)&nbsp;and&nbsp;7.01(b)&nbsp;and with respect to which Tax must be paid, and (ii)&nbsp;within five Business Days following an
agreement between Seller and Purchaser that an indemnity amount is payable or a "determination" as defined in Section&nbsp;1313(a)&nbsp;of the Code. If liability under this Article&nbsp;VII is
in respect of costs or expenses other than Taxes, payment by Seller of any amounts due under this Article&nbsp;VII shall be made within five Business Days after the date when Seller has been
notified by Purchaser that Seller has a liability for a determinable amount under this Article&nbsp;VII and&nbsp;is provided with calculations or other materials supporting such liability. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION&nbsp;7.06&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Cooperation
and Exchange of Information</U>. Upon the terms set forth in Section&nbsp;5.02 of this Agreement, Seller and
Purchaser will provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes, participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes or making representations to or furnishing
information to parties subsequently desiring to purchase any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries or any part of the business of the Companies and the Subsidiaries from Purchaser. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other
determinations by Tax authorities. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the
Companies and the Subsidiaries for each taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i)&nbsp;the expiration of the statute of limitations
of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of such extensions for the
respective Tax periods, or (ii)&nbsp;six years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Any information obtained under this Section&nbsp;7.6 shall be kept confidential
except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding. </FONT></P>

indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and the officers, directors, employees and agents of each of the foregoing (all&nbsp;such Persons being included within the definition of "Seller" only for
purposes of this Section&nbsp;9.02, Article&nbsp;VI and Article&nbsp;VII) against and hold them harmless from all Losses arising out of (i)&nbsp;the breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of Purchaser herein (other than Article&nbsp;VI and Article&nbsp;VII, it being understood that the sole remedy for any such breach thereof shall be pursuant to
Article&nbsp;VI or Article&nbsp;VII respectively, as applicable), and (ii)&nbsp;subject to the terms of the Racing Services Agreement, the conduct of the business of each Company and Subsidiary
by Purchaser following the Closing Date. Anything in Section&nbsp;9.01 to&nbsp;the contrary notwithstanding, no claim may be asserted, nor, subject to the last sentence of this
Section&nbsp;9.02(a),&nbsp;may any action be commenced, against Purchaser for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, unless written notice of such claim or
action is received by Purchaser describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the date on which the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section&nbsp;9.01 (the&nbsp;"<U>Applicable
Date</U>"), irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have occurred before or after such date. If a claim or a potential claim arises, Purchaser and Seller
shall promptly work in good faith to determine the validity of such claim or potential claim within a reasonable period of time and if such claim or potential claim is not resolved to both parties'
satisfaction within such reasonable period of time, either party may commence legal proceedings to resolve such claim or potential claim (but&nbsp;in no event (other than as described in the next
sentence) after the Applicable Date). If Seller becomes aware of any such claim or potential claim within ninety days prior to the Applicable Date and promptly gives such written notice thereof as
aforesaid on or prior to the Applicable Date, then upon the giving of such notice, Seller and its Affiliates, or any of them, shall have the right to commence legal proceedings for a period of up to
ninety days subsequent to the date of such written notice for the enforcement of their rights under Section&nbsp;9.02 with respect to the matters indicated in such notice. </FONT></P>

benefit to Seller and any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recovered by Seller from any third party with respect thereto (it&nbsp;being agreed that Seller
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover such proceeds and payments and that, promptly after the realization of any insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other similar payment,
Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for such reduction in Losses for which Seller was indemnified prior to the realization of such reduction of Losses). A Tax benefit to Seller for purposes of this
Section&nbsp;9.02 shall be reasonably determined by Seller's Accountants as the difference between (i)&nbsp;the amount of federal, state and local Tax Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates for
the year with respect to which the indemnity payment is made, and (ii)&nbsp;the amount of federal, state and local Tax Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates for the year with respect to which the
indemnity payment is made but without the effect of event that gave rise to the indemnity payment. Seller shall provide Purchaser with calculations and/or other information reasonably supporting the
determination of the amount of the Tax benefit. </FONT></P>

(for&nbsp;purposes of this Section&nbsp;9.04(a),&nbsp;an "<U>Indemnifying Party</U>") prompt written notice (a&nbsp;"<U>Claim Notice</U>") of any
claim, assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect of a third party of which it has knowledge concerning any liability or damage as to which it may request indemnification under
Section&nbsp;6.05, 7.01, 9.02&nbsp;or 9.03, as applicable, provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying
Party from any liability hereunder unless (and&nbsp;then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby is materially prejudiced by the delay. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
assume, through counsel of its own choosing, the defense or settlement of any such claim or proceeding at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such claim or
proceeding, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense, but in such case the expenses of the Indemnified Party shall be paid by it; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>, that if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest (including, without limitation, if there may be one or more legal or equitable
defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or in addition to those of the Indemnifying Party and representation by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual
or potential differences between the parties) that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. With reasonable notice, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable access to its records and personnel relating to any such claim, assertion, event
or proceeding during normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense or settlement thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified
Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment or unless
the Indemnifying Party, subject to the penultimate sentence of this Section&nbsp;9.04(a),&nbsp;withdraws from the defense of such asserted liability or unless a final judgment from which no appeal
may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is entered against the Indemnified Party for such liability. If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to defend, or if after commencing or
undertaking any such defense, fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any such claim or proceeding pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9.04(a)&nbsp;and&nbsp;proposes to settle such claim or proceeding
prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego any appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party
shall have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claim or proceeding. Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party shall settle any claim or
proceeding without the written approval of the Indemnifying Party (in&nbsp;the case of a settlement by the Indemnified Party) or of the Indemnified Party (in&nbsp;the case of a settlement by the
Indemnifying Party), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. </FONT></P>

provided for in Article&nbsp;VI, Article&nbsp;VII or&nbsp;this Article&nbsp;IX and&nbsp;paid or payable by an Indemnified Party. </FONT></P>
