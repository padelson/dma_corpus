The parties agree that such allocation shall be binding and the parties shall not take a position that is inconsistent with such allocation in any matter. 

  

 SECTION 2.03 _Closing_. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Shares contemplated hereby shall take place at a closing (the " _Closing_ ") to be held at 10:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, no later than two Business Days after the last of the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 8.01, 8.02 and 8.03 has been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date) (" _Satisfaction Date_ "); _provided_ , that so long as Purchaser needs additional time in order to obtain the bridge financing for the Purchase Price less the Holdback Amount (the " _Closing Extension_ ") and so long as Purchaser is using its best efforts towards obtaining such financing and Closing, the Closing shall be held no later than four weeks after the last of such conditions to Closing has been satisfied or waived (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date). In the event that the Closing Extension occurs and at the end of the Closing Extension, the last of the conditions to Closing set forth in Sections 8.01, 8.02 and 8.03 has been satisfied (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date), and Purchaser fails to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby, then Seller shall have the right to terminate this Agreement. In the event that the Closing Extension occurs and events take place after the Satisfaction Date that cause one or more conditions to Closing to not be satisfied at the end of the Closing Extension (other than conditions which, by their nature, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date), then the party that has the right not to close as a result of such condition or conditions not being so satisfied shall, within two Business Days after the end of the Closing Extension, either waive all such conditions and proceed to Closing or terminate this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that such right to not close due to such events or due to such condition(s) not being satisfied and such right to terminate this Agreement shall not be available to a party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted in, such events or such condition(s) not being satisfied.

 (c) Gaming Application. 

  

  

 (i) Purchaser and Seller each will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly make available or file with the Gaming Board such information as it or its staff may request under the Gaming Act. Purchaser and Seller will, not later than December 20, 2005 (or two weeks before such other date as the Gaming Board may select for submission of applications so long as filing on such later date does not provide an advantage to other applicants or is otherwise detrimental to the Companies\' application or to their right to timely obtain a Conditional Category 1 license or Category 1 license for gaming from the Gaming Board), file with the Gaming Board the application for Conditional Category 1 license as required by the Gaming Act (the " _Gaming Application_ "). The Gaming Application will be drafted to reflect two different scenarios  one in which Purchaser is the operator and owner of the Meadows Facility and the operator of the gaming operations with an Affiliate of Seller serving as a manager of the racing operations of the Meadows Facility (such scenario, the " _Transaction Scenario_ ") and one in which Seller or one or more of its Affiliates is the operator and owner of the Meadows Facility (the " _Alternative Scenario_ "). In addition, both Purchaser and Seller shall furnish to the Gaming Board such other information, financial statements and other documentation as the Gaming Board requires concerning Purchaser or Seller and will make available representatives of Purchaser or Seller to meet with the Gaming Board, or its staff, to expedite the ability of the Gaming Board to complete its work. For the avoidance of doubt, while Purchaser and Seller will both use reasonable efforts to accomplish the matters set forth in this Section and to assemble such application, Purchaser shall be responsible for all items with respect to the Gaming Application other than the MEC Items. 

  

 (ii) Each of Purchaser and Seller agrees to use its best efforts to complete the Gaming Application for submission to the Gaming Board on or before December 20, 2005, and agrees to have a weekly scheduled telephone call or meeting at which the individuals with responsibility for organizing each of the Purchaser\'s and Seller\'s efforts in connection with the filing of the Gaming Application review and discuss the progress being made to complete the Gaming Application. 

  

 (iii) Either party shall notify the other upon becoming aware that the Gaming Board may consider, identify or support an Action that could jeopardize Seller\'s ability to obtain a Conditional Category 1 license or Category 1 license in its own name if Seller continues to pursue a Conditional Category 1 license or a Category 1 license with Purchaser. Prior to the termination of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser agree not to take any action that could reasonably be expected to impede the consideration of the Gaming Application for the Transaction Scenario (it being acknowledged that Seller\'s exercise of its rights under Section 5.15 or Seller\'s or Purchaser\'s exercise of rights under Section 10.01 shall not be considered an action that constitutes a breach of the obligations set forth in this sentence). Prior to the termination of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser agree to use their best efforts, and continue to use their best efforts, to permit Seller and Purchaser to jointly pursue the Gaming Application for the Transaction Scenario (it being acknowledged that Seller\'s exercise of its rights under Section 5.15 or Seller\'s or Purchaser\'s exercise of rights under Section 10.01 shall not be considered an action that constitutes a breach of the obligations set forth in this sentence). Seller agrees to make itself available to participate in meetings, appearances and hearings to assist in the joint efforts of Seller and Purchaser to pursue the Gaming Application for the Transaction Scenario. 

  

       

 (d) Simultaneously with the submission of the Gaming Application, Purchaser shall at its cost take such steps as are necessary, including but not limited to the posting of a letter of credit, the posting of a bond or the payment of a fee, to satisfy any monetary or financial requirements that the Gaming Board may require in conjunction with submission and maintenance of the Gaming Application (the " _Gaming Application Fee_ "). Until the earlier of the (i) grant of a Conditional Category 1 license for gaming at the Meadows Facility to Purchaser or (ii) two weeks after the termination of this Agreement for any reason other than consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser shall maintain the Gaming Application Fee. If the fee is paid by Purchaser in cash to the Gaming Board to satisfy the requirements of the Gaming Board, and this Agreement is terminated, then Seller shall, to the extent Purchaser does not receive a refund of such fee from the Gaming Board, reimburse Purchaser for the Gaming Application Fee within two weeks after such termination of this Agreement if (i) Seller uses such fee in furtherance of its application with the Gaming Board after such termination, and (ii) Purchaser executes documentation in form and substance satisfactory to Seller confirming that Seller is entitled to, and has full rights with respect to, the fee that Purchaser has paid to the Gaming Board and that Purchaser releases all rights with respect thereto. To the extent that Seller intends to continue with its application with the Gaming Board after the termination of this Agreement, Seller agrees to use best efforts to replace the Gaming Application Fee theretofore maintained by Purchaser as expeditiously as possible after the termination of the Agreement. 

  

 (e) Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason other than consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and Seller agree to take such actions as are necessary as soon as possible to amend the Gaming Application to remove the Transaction Scenario. In addition, Purchaser shall permit Seller to use and continue to have submitted with the Gaming Application all architectural, design and construction plans and any other materials prepared by Purchaser or its agents or consultants (the " _Purchaser Application Materials_ "); _provided_ , however that Seller agrees to reimburse Purchaser for the reasonable and direct costs incurred by Purchaser with respect to the Purchaser Application Materials used by Seller in the event that this Agreement is terminated for any reason other than consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (f) Upon the Closing, Purchaser and Seller agree to take such actions as are necessary as soon as possible to amend the Gaming Application to remove the Alternative Scenario, if required by the Gaming Board. 

  

 (g) Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all notices to and obtain all consents from all third parties and Governmental Authorities that are described in Section 3.05(c) or Section 3.06 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and Section 4.03 of Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, including but not limited to the Commission Approvals. Seller and Purchaser agree to consider comments and input from Governmental Authorities and to use commercially reasonable efforts to consider means in which to address such comments and input without resulting in changing or adversely affecting the economics of the transactions contemplated hereby or the ability of either party to close such transaction. 

        

 (h) Without limiting the generality of the parties\' undertakings pursuant to Section 5.04(a) though (g), each of the parties hereto shall use all reasonable efforts to (i) respond to any inquiries by any Governmental Authority regarding antitrust or other matters with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any agreement or document contemplated hereby, (ii) avoid the imposition of any order or the taking of any action that would restrain, alter or enjoin the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) in the event any Governmental Order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any agreement or document contemplated hereby has been issued, to have such Governmental Order vacated or lifted. 

  

 (i) If any consent, approval or authorization necessary to preserve any right or benefit under any lease, license, contact, commitment or other agreement or arrangement to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party is not obtained prior to the Closing, Seller shall, subsequent to the Closing, cooperate with Purchaser and the Companies in attempting to obtain such consent, approval or authorization as promptly thereafter as practicable. If such consent, approval or authorization cannot be obtained, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, with the rights and benefits of the affected lease, license, contract, commitment or other agreement or arrangement for the term thereof, and, if Seller provides such rights and benefits, such Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall assume all obligations and burdens thereunder. 

  

 (j) From the date hereof until the Closing, each party hereto shall, and Seller shall cause each Company and Subsidiary to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof. 

   

 (k) Promptly upon the signing of this Agreement, Purchaser shall use its best efforts, and shall continue to use its best efforts, to obtain the evidence necessary to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 8.03(o) as soon as practicable after the signing of this Agreement. 

  

 (l) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals made by or on behalf of either party before any Governmental Authority, including the Gaming Board and the Commission, or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions between Seller, the Companies or the Subsidiaries with Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of the conduct of its business operations, any disclosure which is not permitted by law or any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each party shall give notice to the other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other party with the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact. 

        

 (m) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties agree that at any time after the date which is 14 days prior to the date, if any, identified by the Gaming Board after which continued pursuit by Seller of a Conditional Category 1 license with Purchaser pursuant to the Gaming Application would jeopardize Seller\'s ability to obtain a Conditional Category 1 license or a Category 1 license in its own name, Seller shall not have any obligation during the period of such jeopardy to comply with any of its obligations under Section 5.4, Section 5.12 and any other provision of this Agreement that would require Seller to directly or indirectly comply with any of its obligations under Section 5.4 or 5.12. 

  

 SECTION 5.05 _Confidentiality_. (a) The terms of the letter agreement dated September 21, 2005 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between Seller and Millennium Management Group, LLC are hereby incorporated herein by reference as if Purchaser were a party thereto and shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of Purchaser under this Section 5.05 shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate only in respect of that portion of the Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) exclusively relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 

  

 (b) Seller agrees to, and shall cause its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers and directors to, protect (and not disclose or provide access to any Person) all confidential information relating to trade secrets, price, customer and supplier lists and pricing and marketing plans with respect to the business of the Companies and the Subsidiaries and all other information that Seller regards as confidential information as of the date hereof with respect to the business of the Companies and the Subsidiaries as currently conducted, by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of such confidential information, as Seller uses to protect its own confidential information of a like nature; _provided_ , _however_ , that this sentence shall not apply to any information that, at the time of disclosure, (i) is disclosed by and between Seller and its agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers or directors on a need-to-know basis (provided that such Persons are bound by a duty of confidentiality), (ii) is available publicly and was not disclosed in breach of this Agreement by Seller or its respective agents, representatives, Affiliates, employees, officers or directors (provided that information provided to or filed with the Commission or any other Governmental Authority shall not be deemed to be publicly available by virtue of such filing), or (iii) is required to be disclosed in compliance with Section 5.04 of this Agreement, federal and state laws or regulations or the regulations governing any national securities exchange or quotation system or is requested by a regulatory body that has authority over Seller or Purchaser (provided that Seller provides prompt notice to Purchaser of the disclosure requirement and uses its reasonable efforts to disclose only such confidential information as is legally required to be disclosed and exercises reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that such confidential information will be accorded confidential treatment).

 (b) Purchaser shall, promptly following the Closing Date, cause each Company and Subsidiary to remove or obliterate the Magna Name from all of its existing stocks of signs, letterheads, advertisements and promotional materials and other documents and materials (" _Existing Stock_ ") or to cease using such Existing Stock.

 SECTION 5.07 _Investigation_. (a) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that (i) has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and, based thereon, has formed an independent judgment concerning, the Companies and Subsidiaries and (ii) it has not, for purposes of entering into this Agreement, relied on any representation or warranty or other statement or omission of Seller or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, stockholders, Affiliates, consultants, counsel, accountants, investment bankers or representatives, other than the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement (including the Exhibits and the Company Disclosure Schedule). 

        

 (b) In connection with Purchaser\'s investigation of the Companies and Subsidiaries, Purchaser has received from Seller certain estimates, projections, forecasts, plans and budgets for the Companies and Subsidiaries, including, without limitation, projected income statement and balance sheet information.

Accordingly, Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to any estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or budgets referred to in this Section 5.07, except that they have been prepared in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. 

  

 SECTION 5.08 _Limited Non-Compete_. (a) As an inducement for Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and in consideration of the receipt of $2,000,000 in cash (which amount is included in the Purchase Price), Seller agrees that for a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the later of (i) five years from the Closing Date and (ii) twelve months after the termination of the Racing Services Agreement for any reason (the " _Non-Competition Period_ "), except with Purchaser\'s prior written consent, Seller shall not directly or indirectly (including through MEC Pennsylvania Racing Services, Inc.) own or operate a pari-mutuel wagering facility with expanded gaming within 100 miles of the Meadows Facility (the " _Non-Competition Covenant_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Non-Competition Covenant shall not apply to Thistledown (located in North Randall, Ohio) or operation of the Meadows Facility pursuant to the Racing Services Agreement. 

  

 (b) Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that a breach or violation of the Non-Competition Covenant shall entitle Purchaser, as a matter of right, to an injunction issued by any court of competent jurisdiction restraining any further or continued breach of violation of such covenant. Such right to an injunction shall be cumulative, and in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies to which Purchaser may show itself justly entitled. Further, during any period in which Seller or any of its Affiliates are in breach of the Non-Competition Covenant, the time period of such covenant shall be extended for an amount of time that Seller or any of its Affiliates are in breach hereof, with the effect that the total duration of the Non-Competition Covenant shall be the original period plus the actual amount of time that Seller or any of its Affiliates are in breach. 

  

 (c) Further, Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that the Non-Competition Covenant is appropriate and reasonable when considered in light of the nature and extent of the business conducted by Purchaser. Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that: (i) Purchaser would not enter into this Agreement unless Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, agreed to the Non-Competition Covenant; and (ii) it has read and understands the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Non-Competition Covenant, and has been provided the opportunity to discuss this Agreement and such covenant with Purchaser and counsel of its choice and has carefully considered the nature and extent of the restrictions upon it and the rights and remedies conferred upon Purchaser hereunder. Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, hereby acknowledges and agrees that Purchaser has a legitimate interest in protecting its business and that the Non-Competition Covenant is reasonable in limitations as to time, scope, geographical area and activity, and is fully required and is no greater than necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Purchaser. Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, further agrees that the Non-Competition Covenant is not unduly harsh or oppressive to Seller, or any of its Affiliates, in curtailing their legitimate efforts to earn a livelihood and does not stifle the inherent skill and experience of Seller, or any of its Affiliates, or confer a benefit upon Purchaser disproportionate to the detriment to Seller, or any of its Affiliates, or harm in any manner whatsoever the public interest or operate as a bar to the sole means of support of Seller, or any of its Affiliates. 

        

 (d) Seller, for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that if the Non-Competition Covenant should be held by any Governmental Authority to be void or unenforceable in any particular area or jurisdiction, then Purchaser and Seller shall consider this Agreement to be modified so as to eliminate that particular area or jurisdiction as to which the Non-Competition Covenant is held to be void or otherwise enforceable, and as to all other areas and jurisdictions and scope covered by this Agreement, the terms hereof shall remain in full force and effect as originally written. Further, if the Non-Competition Covenant should be held by any Governmental Authority to be effective in any particular area or jurisdiction or scope only if said covenant is modified to limit its duration or scope, then Seller and Purchaser shall consider the Non-Competition Covenant to be amended and modified with respect to that particular area or jurisdiction so as to comply with the order of any Governmental Authority, and as to all other political subdivisions of the United States, the Non-Competition Covenant shall remain in full force and effect as originally written.

Seller shall make reasonable efforts to cure each Title Objection included in Purchaser\'s Notice or to cause the Title Company to eliminate each Title Objection as an exception to the Title Commitment or to remove it from the Survey. Any Title Objection that is cured or that the Title Company is willing to insure over on terms acceptable to Seller and Purchaser is herein referred to as an " _Insured Exception_." The Insured Exceptions shall be deemed to be acceptable to Purchaser.

 (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (x) based upon or related to income or receipts, or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible) (other than conveyances pursuant to this Agreement, as provided under Section 7.07), deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended with the Closing Date; and 

  

      

  

 (ii) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to the assets of the Companies or any Subsidiary, or otherwise measured by the level of any item, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period), multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire period. 

  

  

 (c) Any indemnity payable under this Section 7.01 shall be net of any Tax benefit enjoyed by the applicable indemnified party, determined in a manner consistent with the last two sentences in Section 9.02(b) or Section 9.03(c) hereof. 

  

 SECTION 7.02 _Returns and Payments_. (a) From the date of this Agreement through and after the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and file or otherwise furnish in proper form to the appropriate Governmental Authority (or cause to be prepared and filed or so furnished) in a timely manner all Tax Returns relating to the Companies and the Subsidiaries that are due on or before or relate to any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (and Purchaser shall do the same with respect to any taxable period ending after the Closing Date). Tax Returns of the Companies and the Subsidiaries not yet filed for any taxable period that begins before the Closing Date shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices employed with respect to the Companies and the Subsidiaries (except to the extent counsel for Seller or the Companies renders a legal opinion that there is no reasonable basis in law therefor or determines that a Tax Return cannot be so prepared and filed without being subject to penalties). With respect to any Tax Return required to be filed by Purchaser or Seller with respect to the Companies and the Subsidiaries and as to which an amount of Tax is allocable to the other party under Section 7.01(b), the filing party shall provide the other party and its authorized representatives with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a statement certifying the amount of Tax shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to such other party pursuant to Section 7.01(b), together with appropriate supporting information and schedules at least 20 Business Days prior to the due date (including any extension thereof) for the filing of such Tax Return, and such other party and its authorized representatives shall have the right to review and comment on such Tax Return and statement prior the filing of such Tax Return. 

   

 (b) Seller shall pay or cause to be paid when due and payable all Taxes described in Sections 7.01(a)(i) and 7.01(a)(ii), and Purchaser shall so pay or cause to be paid Taxes for any taxable period ending after the Closing Date (subject to its right of indemnification from Seller by the date set forth in Section 7.05 for Taxes attributable to the portion of any Tax period that includes the Closing Date pursuant to Sections 7.01(a) and 7.01(b)). 

        

 SECTION 7.03 _Refunds_. Any Tax refund (including any interest with respect thereto), and any equivalent benefit through a reduction in tax liability for a post-Closing Date period, relating to the Companies or any Subsidiary for any taxable period prior to the Closing Date shall be the property of Seller, and if received by Purchaser or the Companies or any Subsidiary shall be paid over to Seller within five Business Days of the earlier of receipt or entitlement thereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that any Tax benefit obtained by Purchaser, the Companies or any Subsidiary as a result of utilizing any net operating loss carryforward or other carryforward (which may be subject to adjustments) which is allocable to the Companies or any Subsidiary shall be retained by Purchaser, the Companies or such Subsidiary. Purchaser shall cause the Companies and the Subsidiaries to elect, where permitted by law, to carry forward any net operating loss, charitable contribution or other item arising after the Closing Date that could, in the absence of such election, be carried back to a taxable period of the Companies ending on or before the Closing Date in which the Companies are included in a consolidated, combined or unitary Tax return; provided that, if such election to carry forward an item is not available, any cash refund received by Seller with respect to such carryback shall be paid over to Purchaser within five Business Days of actual receipt. Purchaser shall, if Seller so requests and at Seller\'s expense, cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any refunds or equivalent amounts to which Seller is entitled under this Section 7.03. Purchaser shall permit Seller to control (at Seller\'s expense) the prosecution of any such refund claim, and shall cause the relevant entity to authorize by appropriate power of attorney such persons as Seller shall designate to represent such entity with respect to such refund claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller shall not take any action in the prosecution of such refund claims that would be materially detrimental to Purchaser, the Companies or the Subsidiaries (including for this purpose the tax positions of such entities). In the event that any refund or credit of Taxes for which a payment has been made to Seller pursuant to this Section 7.03 is subsequently reduced or disallowed, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the payor for any Tax Liability, including interest and penalties assessed against such payor by reason of the reduction or disallowance. 

  

 SECTION 7.04 _Contests_. (a) After the Closing, Purchaser shall promptly notify Seller in writing upon the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding that could affect Seller, and shall also separately notify Seller, in writing, of a proposed assessment or claim in an audit or administrative or judicial proceeding of Purchaser or of any of the Companies and the Subsidiaries which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer, would be grounds for indemnification under this Article VII. If Purchaser fails to give Seller prompt notice of an asserted Tax liability as required by this Section 7.04, then (a) if Seller is precluded by the failure to give notice within 30 days of the commencement of such proceeding from contesting the asserted Tax liability in both the administrative and judicial forums, then Purchaser shall have sole responsibility for such Tax liability or (b) if Seller is not precluded from contesting but such failure to give notice within 30 days of the commencement of such proceeding results in detriment to Seller, then any amount that Seller is otherwise required to pay to Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.01 with respect to such liability shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment. 

        

 (b) Seller may elect to direct, through counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense, any audit, claim for refund and administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought under this Article VII (any such audit, claim for refund or proceeding relating to an asserted tax liability are referred to herein collectively as a " _Contest_ "). If Seller elects to direct the Contest of an asserted Tax liability, it shall within 30 days of receipt of the notice of asserted tax liability notify Purchaser of its intent to do so, and Purchaser shall cooperate and shall cause each Subsidiary and any successor to a Subsidiary or its successor to cooperate, at Seller\'s expense, in each phase of such Contest. Purchaser also may participate in any such audit or proceeding and, if Seller does not assume the defense of any such audit or proceeding, Purchaser may defend the same in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such audit or proceeding after giving five Business Days\' prior written notice to Seller setting forth the terms and conditions of settlement. In the event that issues relating to a potential adjustment for which Seller would be liable are required to be dealt with in the same proceeding as separate issues relating to a potential adjustment for which Purchaser would be liable, Purchaser shall have the right, at its expense, to control the audit or proceeding with respect to the latter issues. If Seller chooses to direct the Contest, Purchaser shall promptly empower and shall cause the appropriate Subsidiary or its successor promptly to empower (by power of attorney and such other documentation as may be appropriate) such representatives of Seller as it may designate to represent Purchaser or the Subsidiary or its successor in the Contest insofar as the Contest involves an asserted tax liability for which Seller would be liable under this Article VII. If Seller assumes the defense of a Contest, Seller shall not enter into any compromise or agree to settle any claim pursuant to any Tax audit or proceeding which would adversely affect Purchaser for any taxable year without the written consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 SECTION 7.05 _Time of Payment_. Payment by Seller of any amounts due under this Article VII shall be made (i) at least three Business Days before the due date of the applicable estimated or final Tax Return required to be filed by Purchaser on which is required to be reported income for a period ending after the Closing Date for which Seller is responsible under Sections 7.01(a) and 7.01(b) and with respect to which Tax must be paid, and (ii) within five Business Days following an agreement between Seller and Purchaser that an indemnity amount is payable or a "determination" as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code. If liability under this Article VII is in respect of costs or expenses other than Taxes, payment by Seller of any amounts due under this Article VII shall be made within five Business Days after the date when Seller has been notified by Purchaser that Seller has a liability for a determinable amount under this Article VII and is provided with calculations or other materials supporting such liability. 

  

 SECTION 7.06 _Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Upon the terms set forth in Section 5.02 of this Agreement, Seller and Purchaser will provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of the other in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes, participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes or making representations to or furnishing information to parties subsequently desiring to purchase any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries or any part of the business of the Companies and the Subsidiaries from Purchaser. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions thereof, together with accompanying schedules, related work papers and documents relating to rulings or other determinations by Tax authorities. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records and other documents in its possession relating to Tax matters of the Companies and the Subsidiaries for each taxable period first ending after the Closing Date and for all prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other documents relate, without regard to extensions except to the extent notified by the other party in writing of such extensions for the respective Tax periods, or (ii) six years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Any information obtained under this Section 7.6 shall be kept confidential except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding. 

        

 SECTION 7.07 _Conveyance Taxes_. Seller and Purchaser shall each pay 50% of any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer, and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration, and other fees, and any similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall file such applications and documents as shall permit any such Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing Date in accordance with any available pre-sale filing procedure. Each party hereto shall execute and deliver all instruments and certificates necessary to enable the other party or parties to comply with the foregoing. 

   

 SECTION 7.08 _Miscellaneous_. (a) Seller and Purchaser agree to treat all payments made by either of them to or for the benefit of the other (including any payments to the Companies or any Subsidiary) under this Article VII, under other indemnity provisions of this Agreement and for any misrepresentations or breaches of warranties or covenants as adjustments to the Purchase Price or as capital contributions for Tax purposes and that such treatment shall govern for purposes hereof. 

  

 (b) All amounts payable under any tax sharing agreement or arrangement between Seller and the Companies or any Subsidiary for any taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be calculated on a basis consistent with that used to date and shall be considered as an intercompany account owing to or from an Affiliate as of the Closing Date for purposes of Section 5.01(c). Any tax sharing agreement or arrangement between Seller and/or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Companies or any Subsidiary, on the other hand, shall be terminated immediately prior to the Closing and shall have no further effect for any taxable year or period (whether past, present or future) and no additional payments shall be made thereunder in respect of a redetermination of tax liabilities or otherwise. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the obligations of Seller to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, the Companies and the Subsidiaries pursuant to this Article VII, and the representations and warranties contained in Section 3.18, shall terminate at the close of business on the 60th day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the Tax liabilities in question (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof). 

  

 (d) For purposes of this Article VII, "Purchaser" and "Seller," respectively, shall include each member of the affiliated group of corporations of which it is or becomes a member (other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries, except to the extent expressly referenced).

 SECTION 9.02 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. (a) Purchaser agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, to indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and the officers, directors, employees and agents of each of the foregoing (all such Persons being included within the definition of "Seller" only for purposes of this Section 9.02, Article VI and Article VII) against and hold them harmless from all Losses arising out of (i) the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Purchaser herein (other than Article VI and Article VII, it being understood that the sole remedy for any such breach thereof shall be pursuant to Article VI or Article VII respectively, as applicable), and (ii) subject to the terms of the Racing Services Agreement, the conduct of the business of each Company and Subsidiary by Purchaser following the Closing Date. Anything in Section 9.01 to the contrary notwithstanding, no claim may be asserted, nor, subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.02(a), may any action be commenced, against Purchaser for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, unless written notice of such claim or action is received by Purchaser describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the date on which the representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on which such claim or action is based ceases to survive as set forth in Section 9.01 (the " _Applicable Date_ "), irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have occurred before or after such date.

 (b) Payments by Purchaser pursuant to Section 9.02(a) shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom any Tax benefit to Seller and any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recovered by Seller from any third party with respect thereto (it being agreed that Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover such proceeds and payments and that, promptly after the realization of any insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other similar payment, Seller shall reimburse Purchaser for such reduction in Losses for which Seller was indemnified prior to the realization of such reduction of Losses). A Tax benefit to Seller for purposes of this Section 9.02 shall be reasonably determined by Seller\'s Accountants as the difference between (i) the amount of federal, state and local Tax Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates for the year with respect to which the indemnity payment is made, and (ii) the amount of federal, state and local Tax Liabilities of Seller and its Affiliates for the year with respect to which the indemnity payment is made but without the effect of event that gave rise to the indemnity payment. Seller shall provide Purchaser with calculations and/or other information reasonably supporting the determination of the amount of the Tax benefit. 

        

 (c) No claim may be made against Purchaser for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) (other than breaches and claims under Section 2.03(c) and the Fundamental Representations) with respect to any individual item of liability or damage arising out of a breach of a representation or warranty of Purchaser or of a covenant or agreement to be performed by Purchaser prior to the Closing Date, unless the aggregate of all such Losses of Seller with respect to Sections 9.02(a)(i) (other than breaches and claims under Section 2.03(c) and the Fundamental Representations) shall exceed $1,000,000, and Purchaser shall be required to pay or be liable only for amounts in excess of such aggregate amount. Seller shall not be indemnified pursuant to Section 9.02(a)(i) with respect to any individual item of liability or damage (other than breaches and claims under Section 2.03(c) and the Fundamental Representations) if the aggregate of all liabilities and damages of Seller for which Seller has received indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.02(a)(i) shall have exceeded $22,500,000. 

  

 (d) Except as set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser is not making any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to the matters contained herein. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of Seller, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated by this Agreement, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 SECTION 9.03 _Indemnification by Seller_. (a) Seller agrees, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, to indemnify Purchaser and its Affiliates and the officers, directors, employees and agents of each of the foregoing (all such Persons being included in the definition of "Purchaser" only for purposes of this Section 9.03, Article VI and Article VII) against and hold it harmless from all Losses arising out of the following: 

  

  

 (i) the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller herein (other than Article VI and Article VII and Sections 3.16, 3.17 and 3.18, it being understood that the sole remedy for any such breach thereof shall be pursuant to Article VI or Article VII respectively, as applicable); 

  

 (ii) any and all Liabilities related to, arising out of or associated with the Excluded Items or the business or operations of XpressBet, Inc., or any predecessor or successor (including the Companies and the Subsidiaries but only to the extent that the business or operations of the Companies and the Subsidiaries related to the account wagering business now conducted by XpressBet, Inc.), prior to, on and after the Closing Date, including, without limitation, any Liabilities related to, arising out of or associated with the formalizing of the relationship between XpressBet, Inc., Seller, any Company and its Subsidiaries; 

  

 (iii) any and all Liabilities related to, arising out of or associated with the Excluded Subsidiaries or the Former Subsidiaries; 

  

 (iv) any Liability, obligation or responsibility under or related to Environmental Laws, whether such Liability or obligation or responsibility is known or unknown, contingent or accrued, arising from acts, omissions, conduct or circumstances occurring between April 5, 2001 and the Closing Date; 

  

      

  

 (v) any Liability, obligation or responsibility under or required by Environmental Law, whether such Liability, obligation or responsibility is known or unknown, contingent or accrued, arising from acts, omissions, conduct or circumstances occurring prior to April 5, 2001 and the occurrence or existence of which is a violation of Environmental Law existing as of the Closing Date; and 

  

 (vi) those matters set forth in the following Sections of the Company Disclosure Schedules: Schedule 3.05(c) (item (b) only), Schedule 3.10(a) (except for items (g) and (h) under the headings "Litigation Not Covered by Insurance") and Schedule 3.11(a) (under the heading "OSHA Citation"). 

  

  

 Anything in Section 9.01 to the contrary notwithstanding, no claim may be asserted nor, subject to the second to the last sentence of this Section 9.03(a), may any action be commenced against Seller for breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein, unless written notice of such claim or action is received by Seller describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or action on or prior to the Applicable Date, irrespective of whether the subject matter of such claim or action shall have occurred before or after such date. If a claim or a potential claim arises, Purchaser and Seller shall promptly work in good faith to determine the validity of such claim or potential claim within a reasonable period of time and if such claim or potential claim is not resolved to both parties\' satisfaction within such reasonable period of time, either party may commence legal proceedings to resolve such claim or potential claim (but in no event (other than as described in the next sentence) after the Applicable Date). If Purchaser becomes aware of any such claim or potential claim within ninety days prior to the Applicable Date and promptly gives such written notice thereof as aforesaid on or prior to the Applicable Date, then upon the giving of such notice, Purchaser and its Affiliates, or any of them, shall have the right to commence legal proceedings for a period of up to ninety days subsequent to the date of such written notice for the enforcement of their rights under Section 9.03 with respect to the matters indicated in such notice. To the extent that Seller\'s undertakings set forth in this Section 9.03 may be unenforceable, Seller shall contribute the maximum amount that it is permitted to contribute under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Losses incurred by Purchaser, the Companies and the Subsidiaries. 

  

 (b) No claim may be made against Seller for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.03(a)(i) (other than breaches and claims under the Fundamental Representations and Section 3.12 (as to environmental matters)) with respect to any individual item of liability or damage arising out of a breach of a representation or warranty of Seller or of a covenant or agreement to be performed by Seller prior to the Closing Date, unless the aggregate of all such Losses of Purchaser with respect to Section 9.03(a)(i) (other than breaches and claims under the Fundamental Representations and Section 3.12 (as to environmental matters)) shall exceed $1,000,000, and Seller shall be required to pay or be liable only for amounts in excess of such aggregate amount. Purchaser shall not be indemnified pursuant to Section 9.03(a)(i) with respect to any individual item of liability or damage (other than breaches and claims under the Fundamental Representations and Section 3.12 (as to environmental matters)) if the aggregate of all liabilities and damages of Purchaser for which Purchaser has received indemnification pursuant to Section 9.03 (a)(i) shall have exceeded $22,500,000. 

        

 (c) Payments by Seller pursuant to this Sections 9.03, 6.06 and 7.01 shall be limited to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting therefrom (i) any Tax benefit to Purchaser, (ii) any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment recovered by Purchaser from any third party with respect thereto (it being agreed that Purchaser will use its commercially reasonable efforts and will cause Companies and Subsidiaries to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts, to recover such proceeds and payments and that, promptly after the realization of any insurance proceeds, indemnity, contribution or other similar payment, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for such reduction in Losses for which Purchaser was indemnified prior to the realization of reduction of such Losses), and (iii) any amount paid pursuant to Section 15.6.5 of the Racing Services Agreement with respect to the subject matter in dispute to the extent taken into account in determining the payment pursuant to such section. A Tax benefit to Purchaser for purposes of this Section 9.03 will be reasonably determined by Purchaser\'s Accountants as the difference between (i) the amount of federal, state and local Tax Liabilities of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Subsidiaries) for the year with respect to which the indemnity payment is made, and (ii) the amount of federal, state and local Tax Liabilities of Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Subsidiaries) for the year with respect to which the indemnity payment is made but without the effect of event that gave rise to the indemnity payment. Purchaser shall provide Seller with calculations and/or other information reasonably supporting the determination of the Tax benefit. 

  

 (d) Except as set forth in this Agreement (including the Exhibits and the Company Disclosure Schedule), Seller is not making any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement with respect to the matters contained herein. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, no breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part of Purchaser, after the consummation of the purchase and sale of the Shares contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 (e) Seller and its Affiliates shall have no liability under any provision of this Agreement for any liabilities and damages to the extent that such liabilities and damages relate to actions taken by Purchaser or its Affiliates, including, without limitation, each Company and Subsidiary, after the Closing Date. 

   

 (f) Seller and its Affiliates shall have no liability under any provision of this Agreement for any liabilities and damages to the extent that such liabilities and damages are obligations of MEC Pennsylvania Racing Services, Inc. under the Racing Services Agreement to the extent satisfied thereunder. 

        

 SECTION 9.04 _Indemnification Procedures, Etc_. (a) Each of Purchaser and Seller (for purposes of this Section 9.04(a), an " _Indemnified Party_ ") agrees to give the indemnifying party under Section 6.05, 7.01, 9.02 or 9.03, as applicable (for purposes of this Section 9.04(a), an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") prompt written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of any claim, assertion, event or proceeding by or in respect of a third party of which it has knowledge concerning any liability or damage as to which it may request indemnification under Section 6.05, 7.01, 9.02 or 9.03, as applicable, provided, however, that no delay on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby is materially prejudiced by the delay. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume, through counsel of its own choosing, the defense or settlement of any such claim or proceeding at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense, but in such case the expenses of the Indemnified Party shall be paid by it; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest (including, without limitation, if there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or in addition to those of the Indemnifying Party and representation by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differences between the parties) that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel, in each jurisdiction for which the Indemnified Party determines counsel is required, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. With reasonable notice, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonable access to its records and personnel relating to any such claim, assertion, event or proceeding during normal business hours and shall otherwise cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense or settlement thereof, and the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any such claim or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any part of any claim or demand arising from such asserted liability unless the Indemnifying Party consents in writing to such payment or unless the Indemnifying Party, subject to the penultimate sentence of this Section 9.04(a), withdraws from the defense of such asserted liability or unless a final judgment from which no appeal may be taken by or on behalf of the Indemnifying Party is entered against the Indemnified Party for such liability. If the Indemnifying Party shall fail to defend, or if after commencing or undertaking any such defense, fails to prosecute or withdraws from such defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to undertake the defense or settlement thereof, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party assumes the defense of any such claim or proceeding pursuant to this Section 9.04(a) and proposes to settle such claim or proceeding prior to a final judgment thereon or to forego any appeal with respect thereto, then the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the settlement or assume or reassume the defense of such claim or proceeding. Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Indemnifying Party shall settle any claim or proceeding without the written approval of the Indemnifying Party (in the case of a settlement by the Indemnified Party) or of the Indemnified Party (in the case of a settlement by the Indemnifying Party), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

  

 (b) Neither Seller nor Purchaser shall have any liability to Purchaser or Seller (as defined in Section 9.03(a) and Section 9.02(a), respectively), as the case may be, under Article VI, Article VII or this Article IX for consequential or punitive damages, except that this Section 9.04(b) shall not limit an Indemnified Party\'s right to recover fees or expenses of counsel or reimbursement or indemnity for claims by third parties to the extent otherwise provided for in Article VI, Article VII or this Article IX and paid or payable by an Indemnified Party. 

        

 (c) Each of Seller and Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller or Purchaser (as defined in Section 9.02(a) and Section 9.03(a), respectively), as the case may be, against Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, with respect to any and all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article IX and in Article VI and Article VII, except for any claims arising out of fraud and where a party is entitled to seek injunctive relief because there is no adequate remedy at law. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Purchaser and Seller hereby waives, on behalf of itself and any other Purchaser or Seller (as defined in Section 9.02(a) and 9.03(a), respectively), as the case may be, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all rights, claims and causes of action such Purchaser and Seller (or, after the Closing, any Company or Subsidiary), as the case may be, may have against Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, (other than pursuant to this Article IX, Article VI, or Article VII, as applicable) relating to the subject matter of this Agreement arising under or based upon any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to it or by which any of the properties of it or any of its subsidiaries is bound or affected, subject to the exception set forth in the immediately preceding sentence. Nothing in the forgoing provisions of this Section 9.04(c) shall limit any rights or claims any party hereto, any Company, any Subsidiary or MEC Pennsylvania Racing Services, Inc. may have under the Racing Services Agreement. 

  

 (d) Each of Purchaser and Seller agrees that, in the event an Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of any claim or proceeding, it will refrain from making any public announcements in respect of such claim or otherwise communicating with the news media. 

  

 (e) Purchaser and Seller hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which an Action by a third party is brought against any Indemnified Party for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement with respect to such Action or the matters alleged therein and agree that process may be served on Purchaser and Seller with respect to such a claim at the address specified in this Agreement. From and after the Closing, neither the Companies nor the Subsidiaries shall have any Liability to Seller or its Affiliates for any breaches of the representations, warranties, agreements or covenants of Seller, the Companies or the Subsidiaries set forth herein. From and after the Closing, neither Seller nor its Affiliates shall seek indemnification or contribution from any Company or Subsidiary (including any of its employees or agents) for any such breaches or in respect of any other payments required to be made by Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement. Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.04(e) shall limit any rights or claims any party hereto, any Company, any Subsidiary or MEC Pennsylvania Racing Services, Inc. may have under the Racing Services Agreement. 

        

 SECTION 9.05 _Payments_. Once a Loss is agreed to by the Indemnifying Party or finally adjudicated to be payable pursuant to Section 6.05, Section 7.01 or this Article IX, the Indemnifying Party shall satisfy its obligations within fifteen (15) Business Days of such final, nonappealable adjudication by wire transfer of immediately available funds; _provided_ , that during the term of any of the Holdback Documents, if the Indemnifying Party is Seller and the Losses are covered under the Holdback Documents, then such obligations shall be satisfied in accordance with the provisions of the Holdback Documents. The parties hereto agree that should an Indemnifying Party not make full payment of any such obligations (other than such obligations described in the proviso set forth in the immediately preceding sentence) within such fifteen (15) Business Day period, any amount payable shall accrue interest, compounded annually, calculated from the date of agreement of the Indemnifying Party or final, nonappealable adjudication through the date such payment has been made, on the basis of the average of the daily rate of interest publicly announced by Citibank N.A. in New York, New York from time to time as its base rate from the date of such agreement or such adjudication to the date of such payment. The parties hereto agree that any indemnification made pursuant to this Agreement (including without limitation any indemnification covered by the Holdback Documents) shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 (c) by Purchaser, upon a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Seller set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.03 would not be satisfied or if any representation or warranty of Seller shall have become untrue such that Purchaser would have the right not to proceed with the Closing pursuant to Section 8.03(b) (a " _Terminating Seller\'s Breach_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Terminating Seller\'s Breach is curable by Seller through the exercise of its reasonable efforts within 30 days from the date Seller becomes aware thereof and is cured, Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(c) solely by reason of such Terminating Seller\'s Breach; 

  

 (d) by Seller, upon a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of Purchaser set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in Section 8.02 would not be satisfied or if any representation or warranty of Purchaser shall have become untrue such that Seller would have the right not to proceed with the Closing pursuant to Section 8.02(b) (a " _Terminating Purchaser\'s Breach_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if such Terminating Purchaser Breach is curable by Purchaser through the exercise of its reasonable efforts within 30 days from the date Purchaser becomes aware thereof and is cured, Seller may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.01(d) solely by reason of such Terminating Purchaser\'s Breach; 

  

 (e) by Purchaser or Seller in the event that any Governmental Authority shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and nonappealable;

ARTICLE XI 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 (a) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all costs and expenses, including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, whether or not the Closing shall have occurred.

All delinquent Taxes and all delinquent assessments, if any, on the Real Property will be paid at the Closing from funds accruing to Seller. All supplemental Taxes billed after the Closing for periods prior to the Closing will be paid promptly by Seller.

Rents allocable to the period prior to the Closing will be the property of Seller and rents allocable to the period after the Closing will be the property of Purchaser.
