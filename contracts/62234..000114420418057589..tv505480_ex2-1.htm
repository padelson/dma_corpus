 | 28| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(A) If Parent does not give written notice of any dispute describing
in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute and its
alternative calculation of each item of the Final Cash Purchase Price in
dispute (a " _Purchase Price Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer within thirty (30)
days of receiving the Final Closing Statement, the Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be deemed to be final, in each case, for purposes of
determining the Actual Adjustment. Prior to the end of such thirty (30) day
period, Parent may accept the Proposed Closing Date Calculations by
delivering written notice to that effect to Buyer, in which case the Final
Cash Purchase Price will be finally determined when such notice is given.

  



  

(B) If Parent delivers a timely Purchase Price Dispute Notice to
Buyer, Buyer and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
the dispute during the thirty (30) day period commencing on the date Buyer
receives the Purchase Price Dispute Notice from Parent. If Parent and Buyer
do not agree upon a final resolution with respect to any disputed items within
such thirty (30)-day period, then the remaining items in dispute shall be
submitted immediately to Grant Thornton LLP (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The
Accounting Firm shall be instructed to render a determination of the
applicable dispute within thirty (30) days after referral of the matter to
such Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and must set
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor.

  



  

(C) Within ten (10) days after the engagement of the Accounting Firm,
Parent and Buyer shall present their respective positions with respect to the
items set forth in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice in the form of a written
report a copy of which shall be delivered to the other party hereto, and
(without limiting the rights of Parent and its agents under _Section
2.5(c)(ii)_ ) no _ex parte_ conferences, oral examinations, testimony,
depositions, discovery or other form of evidence gathering or hearings
shall be conducted or allowed; _provided_ that, at the Accounting Firm's
request, or as mutually agreed by Parent and Buyer, Parent and Buyer may meet
with the Accounting Firm so long as representatives of both Parent and Buyer
are present. The Accounting Firm's determination shall be instructed to be
based solely on the written reports submitted to the Accounting Firm by
Parent and Buyer, oral submissions by Parent and Buyer at meetings held in
compliance with the prior sentence, and on the definitions and other terms
included herein (i.e., not on independent review); _provided_ that, in
resolving a disputed item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any
particular item greater than the greatest value for such item or less than the
smallest value for such item, in each case claimed by Buyer or Parent in the
written reports presented to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm's
decision with respect to the matters in dispute shall be final and binding on
the parties hereto, and any party may seek to enforce such decision in a
court of competent jurisdiction.

  



    

 | 29| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(D) The terms of appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm
shall be as agreed upon between Parent and Buyer, and any
associated engagement fees shall be initially borne fifty percent (50%) by
Parent and fifty percent (50%) by Buyer; _provided_ that such fees shall
ultimately be borne as set forth below. All other costs and expenses incurred
by the parties hereto in connection with resolving any dispute hereunder
before the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the party incurring such cost and
expense. The fees and disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall ultimately
be allocated among Parent, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, in
the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items submitted
to the Accounting Firm that are unsuccessfully disputed by them (as finally
determined by the Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such disputed
items so submitted. Such determination of the Accounting Firm shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto. The Proposed Closing Date
Calculations shall be revised as appropriate to reflect the resolution of any
objections thereto pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)(i)(A)_ and, as so revised,
such Proposed Closing Date Calculations shall be deemed to set forth the Final
Cash Purchase Price for all purposes hereunder, including the determination
of the Actual Adjustment.

  



  

(ii) Buyer shall, upon written request by Parent, provide Parent and
its accountants and other representatives with reasonable access to the work
papers, schedules, memoranda, and other non-privileged documents and records
used by Buyer to calculate the Proposed Closing Date Calculations at
reasonable times during normal business hours during the period of review by
Parent of, and in connection with the resolution of any objections with
respect to, the Proposed Closing Date Calculations.

  



  

(d) _Payment of Actual Adjustment_.

  



  

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, Buyer shall (and
Marcus shall cause Buyer to) pay, or shall cause to be paid, to Parent or
Movie Tavern, Inc. the Actual Adjustment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent, in each case, within five
(5) Business Days after the date on which the Final Cash Purchase Price is
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5(d)(i)_.

  



    

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, then within five
(5) Business Days after the date on which the Final Cash Purchase Price is
finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5(d)(ii)_ , at Buyer's
election: (A) Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to Buyer an amount
equal to the Actual Adjustment; or (B) Buyer and Parent shall deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent directing the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Buyer cash in the amount of the Actual Adjustment from the
Escrow Fund.

  



  

Section 2.6. _Treatment of Transaction and Purchase Price
Allocation_. Within ninety (90) days after the calculation and payment, if
any, of the Actual Adjustment, Parent shall deliver a draft schedule
allocating the purchase price (as determined for Tax purposes) (the "
_Allocation Schedule_ ") among the Purchased Assets solely for Tax purposes,
including the assets of the Companies, in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code (and any similar provisions of state or local Law, as appropriate), it
being agreed that $1,150,000 of the purchase price (as determined for Tax
purposes) shall be allocated to the Pennsylvania Liquor Permits. Following
delivery of the initial draft Allocation Schedule, Buyer and Parent shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement regarding the allocation
of the purchase price (as determined for Tax purposes) to the Purchased
Assets, and to prepare a final Allocation Schedule. If Buyer and Parent fail
to come to an agreement regarding the allocation of the purchase price to any
of the Purchased Assets within ninety (90) days after Parent delivers the
draft Allocation Schedule to Buyer, such dispute shall be shall be
submitted immediately to the Accounting Firm for resolution. The fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Parent, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other. The parties shall (a) report, act and file
their respective Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) (i) in accordance with
such allocation and any adjustments thereto and the tax treatment described
above, and (ii) treat the Contemplated Transactions for US federal income tax
purposes as a taxable purchase of assets and not as a reorganization under
Section 368 of the Code, and (b) shall not take any position on a Tax Return
or in a Tax audit or similar proceeding inconsistent with _clause (a)_ above,
in each case except upon a contrary final determination by an applicable
taxing authority. To the extent that the Purchase Price is adjusted, Parent
shall prepare an updated Allocation Schedule in accordance with the
procedure set forth in this _Section 2.6_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
parties agree that the portion of any Estimated Cash Purchase Price paid (or
deemed to be paid for federal income Tax purposes) and the Closing Stock
Consideration payable to Movie Tavern, Inc. shall be limited so that the
quotient of the portion of the Estimated Cash Purchase Price payable to Movie
Tavern, Inc. divided by the sum of the value of the Closing Stock
Consideration and the Estimated Cash Purchase Price (in each case, payable to
Movie Tavern, Inc.) shall be no less than 0.21 (the " _Consideration Ratio_
"). For purposes of the Consideration Ratio, the value of the Closing Stock
Consideration on the Closing Date shall be estimated by Buyer using any
reasonable method. In the event the Purchase Price (for federal income Tax
purposes) is adjusted, the parties agree to adjust the amount of cash paid to
Movie Tavern, Inc. so that the Consideration Ratio remains at or above 0.21,
with any excess cash paid to Parent treated as paid to Movie Tavern, Inc. and
then subsequently loaned or distributed to Parent.

  



  

Section 2.7. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer shall have the right to deduct and
withhold from any payments to be made hereunder any amounts required to be
withheld from such payments. All such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to the
applicable recipient of payment in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. Buyer shall notify Parent of any withholding as soon as
reasonably practicable, and shall cooperate with Parent to the extent
requested using commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any such
withholding, with Parent paying any of Buyer's out-of-pocket expenses in
connection with such efforts.

Section 2.8. _Tax, Utility, Rental and Other Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) The following items accruing against the Purchased Assets prior
to the year in which the Closing occurs shall be paid by Parent and the
Companies, and with respect to the year in which the Closing occurs, shall be
apportioned and prorated between Parent and the Companies, on the one hand,
and Buyer, on the other hand, as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, if the precise amount of any item listed below cannot be ascertained on
the Closing Date, apportionment and proration shall be computed on the basis
of the amount payable for each respective item during the year immediately
preceding the year in which the Closing occurs and any prorations shall be
adjusted thereafter on the basis of the actual charges for such items for the
year in which the Closing occurs, which adjustment shall occur within fifteen
(15) calendar days after receipt by the party owing the adjustment of the
appropriate documentation supporting the actual charges, including, but not
limited to, any billing or substantiation thereof received from the lessor or
sublessor related thereto:

  



  

(i) Subject to _Section 2.8(c)_ , rent, additional rent, common area
maintenance and all other charges payable by Parent or any Company as tenant
under the respective Theatre Leases; _provided_ , _however_ , that any charge
payable on a monthly basis which is subject to year-end adjustment shall be
prorated for the month in which the Closing Date occurs and any year-end
adjustment thereof shall be paid by (or the refund from the lessor or
sublessor paid to) Parent and the Companies, on the one hand, and Buyer, on
the other hand, in proportion to their respective payments thereof; and

  



  

(ii) Payments owing by Parent or any Company under the respective
Theatre Leases to merchants' associations or similar business
promotion organizations.

  



  

(b) Amounts imposed upon or assessed against each respective Theatre
(and not otherwise payable by Parent or any Company as tenant under
the respective Theatre Leases directly to the lessor or sublessor thereunder
or payable by lessor or sublessor without any obligation of payment on the
part of Parent or any Company) shall be remitted to the collecting authorities
by Parent or the Companies if the same are due and payable on or before the
Closing Date, and by Buyer if due and payable thereafter; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that amounts imposed upon or assessed against the Purchased
Assets for the lease year or Tax year (whichever is applicable) in which the
Closing Date occurs (the " _Proration Period_ ") shall be apportioned and
prorated between Parent and the Companies, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the
other hand, on and as of the Closing Date with Buyer bearing the expense of
Buyer's proportionate share of such amounts which shall be equal to the
product obtained by multiplying a fraction, the numerator being the aggregate
of such amounts and the denominator being 365, by the number of days in the
Proration Period following the Closing Date. If any party (the " _Paying
Party_ ") pays or has paid an amount for which the other party (the " _Non-
Paying Party_ ") is responsible pursuant to the apportionment set forth in
this _Section 2.8(b)_ , the Paying Party shall be entitled to reimbursement
from the Non-Paying Party.

  



    

 | 32| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) With respect to those Theatre Leases that require any percentage
rent payment for the lease year in which the Closing Date occurs,
which percentage rent calculations are summarized on _Schedule 2.8(c)_ , the
percentage rent (taking into account any applicable credits or adjustments)
shall be prorated between Parent and the Companies, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, such that each party shall be obligated to pay its
proportionate share of the total percentage rent payable for such lease year.
Each party's proportionate share shall equal such party's respective gross
receipts, box office receipts or gross sales (as applicable under and as
defined in the respective Theatre Lease for determining percentage rent owed,
the " _Gross Receipts_ "), divided by the total Gross Receipts, in each case,
for that Theatre for such lease year. Within thirty (30) days after the
Closing, Parent and the Companies shall provide Buyer with documentation,
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, of the amount of Gross Receipts accruing for
each month prior to the month of Closing, and the approximate amount of Gross
Receipts accruing month-to-date for the month of Closing, for the lease year
in which the Closing occurs under each respective Theatre Lease. After Buyer
calculates the amount of percentage rent for each Theatre Lease for the lease
year in which the Closing occurs in accordance with the provisions of such
Theatre Lease, Buyer shall notify Parent of such percentage rent amount, and
upon receipt of documentation supporting such payment in form reasonably
acceptable to Parent, the parties shall make the payments required by this
_Section 2.8(c)_ to the party to whom any amount is due.

  



  

(d) Any adjustments to the Purchase Price under this _Section 2.8_
shall be effected, to the extent then known, by adjusting the Estimated Cash
Purchase Price payable by Buyer at Closing, and to the extent not then known,
within fifteen (15) calendar days after receipt by the party owing payment of
the appropriate documentation supporting the actual charges, by cash payment
from the party owing monies because of the adjustment to the party benefiting
from the adjustments.

  



  

Section 2.9. _Closing Stock Consideration Adjustments_. Without
limiting any other the provision in this Agreement, if, from the Agreement
Date until the Closing, the shares of Marcus Common Stock shall have been
changed into, or exchanged for, a different number of shares or a different
class, by reason of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares, or similar
transaction, the Closing Stock Consideration and any items on which the
calculation of the Closing Stock Consideration depends, as the case may be,
shall be correspondingly adjusted as appropriate to provide the holders of the
shares of Marcus Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such event.

Affiliates retaining the rights and remaining obligated for the Liabilities
under such Shared Contracts with respect to any Person other than the
Companies in accordance with the terms of each such Shared Contract), and (b)
assign to Buyer all post-Closing rights and Liabilities, other than Excluded

Equipment Agreement, would result in the termination or reduction of any
Virtual Print Fees payable to Parent or the Companies thereunder in
accordance with _Section 5.3(b)_.

of the Transferred Employees with the Companies or their Affiliates, as if

corresponding Employee Benefit Plan, and (ii) in the case of any such Buyer
Benefit Plans that are governed by an insurance policy, to the consent of the
relevant insurance carrier, if required.

shortening of such period due to plan termination) such that neither Buyer nor
any Affiliate thereof shall assume or otherwise be liable, in any manner, for
any COBRA obligations of Parent or the Companies in respect of such
Business Employees.

  



  

(f) This  _Section 5.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to
the benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section 5.9_ , express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 5.9_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set

its Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

Companies or Parent in this Agreement was when made, or has subsequently
become, untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, (b) of the

breach of any covenant, condition or agreement contained in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Document or otherwise limit or affect the rights of, or the
remedies available to, Buyer, including the rights and remedies specified in

Section 5.11. _Pass Cards_. Buyer agrees to honor in accordance with
their terms all outstanding Pass Cards issued prior to the Closing, in each
case, to the extent the Pass Card Liabilities with respect thereto are

no obligation to honor any Courtesy Passes.

  



  

Section 5.12. _Further Assurances_. Subject to the limitations on
Buyer's and its Affiliates' obligations set forth in _Section 5.1(a)_ , from

 _provided_ that  _Section 5.14(a)_ shall not (i) prohibit the ownership of

(c) Parent and each Company acknowledges that a breach or threatened
breach of this _Section 5.14_ may give rise to irreparable harm to Buyer and
the Buyer Indemnitees, for which monetary damages may not be an adequate
remedy, and hereby agrees that in the event of a breach or a threatened
breach by Parent or such Company of any such obligations, Buyer and each Buyer
Indemnitee shall, in addition to any and all other rights and remedies that
may be available to it in respect of such breach, be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction,
specific performance and any other relief that may be available from a court
of competent jurisdiction without any requirement to post bond. The Restricted

by Parent of its covenants in this _Section 5.14_ , subject to any contrary
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction.

  



  

(d) Parent and each Company acknowledge that the restrictions
contained in this _Section 5.14_ are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of Buyer and constitute a material inducement to Buyer to
enter into this Agreement and consummate the Contemplated Transactions. In
the event that any covenant contained in this _Section 5.14_ should ever be
adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service or other
limitations permitted by applicable Law in any jurisdiction, then any court
is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such covenant shall be
deemed reformed, in such jurisdiction to the maximum time, geographic,
product or service or other limitations permitted by applicable Law. The
covenants contained in this _Section 5.14_  and each provision of this
_Section 5.14_ are severable and distinct covenants and provisions. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any such covenant or provision as written
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable the remaining covenants or
provisions, and any such invalidity or unenforceability in any jurisdiction
shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such covenant or provision in
any other jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 5.15. _Payment Dispute_. During the Restricted Period, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10) days of

or imposed upon Buyer or any of its Affiliates in respect of such amount, and
(b) all reasonable out-of-pocket fees or expenses incurred by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to obtain such amount and remit such amount to Parent. For the

shall have no obligation to remit any Luxury Reimbursements to Parent or any
Affiliate of Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, none of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates shall have any obligation to take or omit any action to obtain any
Luxury Reimbursement, other than such acts or omissions that are required of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing pursuant to the express
provisions of the Theatre Lease to which such Luxury Reimbursement relates.

  



  

Section 5.17. _Greensboro Movie Tavern License_. In consideration of
the Contemplated Transactions, effective at Closing, Buyer hereby grants to
Parent and Greensboro Theatres, LLC a limited, non-exclusive, non-
sublicensable, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the Intellectual
Property used at and in connection with the Greensboro Movie Tavern during the
thirty (30)-day period immediately preceding the Closing (the " _Greensboro
Movie Tavern IP_ ") in connection with the operation of the Greensboro Movie
Tavern for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing (the "
_License Period_ "). During the License Period, Parent and Greensboro
Theatres, LLC shall use the Greensboro Movie Tavern IP only (a) in the manner
and for the purpose that Parent and Greensboro Theatres, LLC used such

Tavern during the thirty (30)-day period immediately preceding the Agreement
Date, and (b) in a manner that meets or exceeds the established standard of
high-quality use associated with the Greensboro Movie Tavern IP (the "
_License Standards_ "). If, at any time during the License Period, Buyer
reasonably determines that Parent or Greensboro Theatres, LLC is using any
of the Greensboro Movie Tavern IP in a manner or for a purpose that violates
the License Standards or otherwise adversely impacts the reputation or
goodwill of any of the Acquired IP, then Buyer shall provide written notice to
Parent of such determination and Parent and Greensboro Theatres, LLC shall
have (10) Business Days following receipt of such notice to cure such
violation to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer. If Parent and Greensboro
Theatres, LLC are unable to cure such violation to the
reasonable satisfaction of Buyer prior to the expiration of such ten (10)
Business Day cure period, then Buyer, by delivery of written notice of
termination to Parent, may terminate the license granted under this _Section
5.17_ with immediate effect. Parent shall phase out its use of all Greensboro
Movie Tavern IP, as promptly as practicable, and in any event Parent shall,
prior to the expiration of the License Period (at which time the license
granted under this _Section 5.17_ shall automatically terminate),
discontinue the use of all Greensboro Movie Tavern IP, including in all
advertising, labeling, signage, stationery, inventory and other mediums at or
relating to the Greensboro Movie Tavern or otherwise.

Section 5.18. _Alcoholic Beverage Permits_. To the extent permitted
by applicable Law, Parent and each applicable Company shall transfer, or
cause to be transferred, to Buyer or its designee, at Closing, all alcoholic
beverage Permits which are in their respective names and which are necessary
for the operation of each Theatre (and, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or elsewhere, to the extent that applicable Laws prohibit the
transfer of any portion of Concession Inventory connected with the same,
then Buyer or its designee shall be required to purchase the Concession
Inventory, but the transfer of Concession Inventory shall be appropriately
limited or reduced as necessary to comply with such applicable Laws without
otherwise delaying Closing or reducing the Purchase Price, and such matters
shall in no event constitute any breach or default by Parent or the Companies
or any failure of a condition hereunder). Parent, each Company, Buyer and
Marcus shall reasonably cooperate with the other, and each shall execute or
cause to be executed such transfer forms, Permit applications and other
documents as may be necessary to affect such transfers and/or to permit Buyer
to obtain New Liquor Permits. If applicable Law does not permit the transfer
of any alcoholic beverage Permits used by each Theatre, then Parent, each
Company, Buyer and Marcus agree that they will promptly execute or cause to
be executed all transfer forms, applications and other documents required by
applicable Governmental Entities in order to affect such transfer or issuance
of New Liquor Permits at the earliest date possible consistent with applicable
Laws, such that (a) all existing alcoholic beverage Permits (and/or such
related Concession Inventory) used in connection with each Theatre shall be
transferred to Buyer or its designee, or (b) Buyer or its designee obtains
the New Liquor Permits. If: (x) each alcoholic beverage Permit held by Parent
or the Companies and used at any Theatre has not been transferred to Buyer or
Buyer's designee at or prior to Closing; or, (y) despite commercially
reasonable efforts by Buyer, any New Liquor Permit has not been issued to
Buyer or Buyer's designee that would permit Buyer and its Affiliates the
ability to lawfully serve alcohol at each Theatre on and after the
Closing, then, subject to applicable Laws, Parent and each Company (as
applicable) shall cause the holder of each alcoholic beverage Permit used by
any Theatre (each an " _Existing Permittee_ ") to enter into an interim liquor
agreement (an " _Interim Liquor Agreement_ ") or any other such license
agreements, management agreements and/or other interim agreements, in
each case, in form reasonably acceptable to Parent, with Buyer or Buyer's
designee as may be reasonably necessary for the continuation of the sale and
consumption of alcoholic beverages at each Theatre after the Closing and
before such time as Buyer or Buyer's designee (the " _New Permittee_ ")
obtains new alcohol beverage Permits (each a " _New Liquor Permit_ ", and
collectively, the " _New Liquor Permits_ ") provided, however, the obligation
of Parent and each Company to cooperate and keep open the liquor facilities
of each Theatre shall terminate one hundred eighty (180) days after the
Closing Date, or earlier, if Buyer or Buyer's designee obtains all of the New
Liquor Permits at an earlier date. At such time after Closing as all New
Liquor Permits are obtained, each Existing Permittee will convey, at no
additional costs, all Concession Inventory that constitutes alcoholic
beverages to New Permittee by a conveyance document in form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and in accordance with the requirements of applicable
Laws. During the effectiveness of any Interim Liquor Agreement, each Existing
Permittee that is a party to an Interim Liquor Agreement shall maintain, or
cause to be maintained, at Buyer's expense, and to the extent Parent and the
Companies do not have Insurance Policies that provide for dram shop liability
coverage, then prior to Closing, Parent and the Companies shall obtain
insurance policies that provide coverage in an amount not less than $1,000,000
per occurrence and $8,000,000 in the aggregate, for each Existing Permittee
that is a party to an Interim Liquor Agreement all Insurance Policies that
provide coverage for dram shop liability during the effectiveness of the
Interim Liquor Agreement. Parent and Buyer shall use good faith efforts to
agree on the form of the Interim Liquor Agreement during the period of time
commencing as of the Agreement Date and the Closing Date. This _Section
5.18_ shall survive the Closing.

the first Overnight Transaction is consummated pursuant to the
Shareholders' Agreement (the " _Escrow Funding Date_ "), Parent shall pay or
cause to be paid to the Escrow Agent an amount in cash equal to $10,000,000,
to be held in the Escrow Fund subject to, and disbursed from the Escrow Fund
as provided in, this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(b) On April 16, 2020, the parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to disburse to Parent an amount such that the funds then remaining in
the Escrow Fund, after giving effect to such disbursement, would equal the sum
of $5,000,000, _plus_ the aggregate amount of all Pending Indemnification
Claims as of such date. On the date that is thirty-six (36) months following
the Closing Date, the parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
disburse to Parent an amount such that the funds then remaining in the
Escrow Fund, after giving effect to such disbursement, would equal the sum of
$2,500,000, _plus_ the aggregate amount of all Pending Indemnification Claims
as of such date. On the date that is forty-eight (48) months following the
Closing Date, the parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse
to Parent an amount such that the funds then remaining in the Escrow Fund,
after giving effect to such disbursement, would equal the sum of $0, _plus_
the aggregate amount of all Pending Indemnification Claims as of such date.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Parent, any Company or any
other Person be required to contribute any additional amount to the Escrow
Fund at any time following the Escrow Funding Date.

  



  

Section 5.20. _Registered Marcus Common Stock_. On or prior to the
earlier of (a) the Closing Date, and (b) the 59th day following the date of
this Agreement, Marcus shall file with the SEC a Registration Statement to
register the resale of the Registrable Securities. Marcus shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement filed
pursuant to the preceding sentence to be declared effective by the SEC as
soon as practicable following the filing thereof (but in any event prior to
the Closing) and to maintain the effectiveness of such Registration Statement
until the date as of which all Registrable Securities have been sold pursuant
to such Registration Statement or sold pursuant to another Registration
Statement filed under the Securities Act. Marcus shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and
supplements to any such Registration Statement and the prospectus included
therein as may be necessary to keep any such Registration Statement
continuously effective (and available for use) throughout such period and to
ensure that any such Registration Statement and prospectus does not contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading. Marcus shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
other reasonable actions (including, causing such securities to be listed or
quoted on a national securities exchange) as may be reasonably necessary to
facilitate the resale of such securities pursuant to any such Registration
Statement. Marcus shall bear all expenses incurred by it in connection with
the performance of its obligations expressly set forth in this _Section 5.20_
, including all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of compliance
with securities or "blue sky" laws, listing application fees,
printing expenses, transfer agent's and registrar's fees, costs of
distributing prospectuses in preliminary and final form as well as any
supplements thereto, and fees and disbursements of counsel for, and all
independent certified public accountants and other persons retained by,

reasonable efforts to reasonably cooperate with Parent and its Affiliates with
respect to the Pending Litigation, including, without limitation, by making
available, upon Parent's reasonable request, including for interviews and
preparation sessions prior to depositions and trial, the Business' then
current directors, officers and employees (whether as witnesses or otherwise)
and any books, records or other documents within their respective possession,
custody or control that Buyer has the reasonable and legally permissible
ability to make available, to the extent that such person or books, records
or other documents are reasonably required in connection with any Pending
Litigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary (a) Parent and the Companies shall be responsible
for all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers or employees (the "
_Cooperating Parties_ ") in taking or causing to be taken any action pursuant
to this _Section 5.21_ , and Parent and the Companies shall advance all such
fees and expenses to the Cooperating Parties such that no Cooperating Party
shall be required to pay or incur any such fees or expenses; (b) no
Cooperating Party shall be required to take any action pursuant to this
_Section 5.21 _ outside of normal business hours or in any circumstance in
which the taking of such action would reasonably be expected to result in any
Loss to, or otherwise have an adverse impact on, the Business, any of the
Purchased Assets or the ability of any Buyer Indemnitee to seek or obtain any
indemnification to which it may be entitled pursuant to _Article 8_ ,
including taking any action in respect of a Pending Litigation that involves
any party to an Assigned Contract or any other person or entity
having material business dealings with the Business; (c) Parent and the

implied duty to Parent, any Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, all such duties being owed exclusively to Marcus and Buyer.
Without limiting the foregoing, and in consideration for the
Cooperating Parties' performance of their obligations under this _Section

respective Affiliates, agree not to (i) compromise or settle any Pending
Litigation, or (ii) threaten or commence (including by way of counterclaim or
interpleader) any Action against the counterparty to an Assigned Contract in
respect of such Assigned Contract, if, in the case of each of _clauses (i)_
and _(ii)_ , such settlement or compromise, or the threat or commencement of
such Action, would reasonably be expected to result in any Loss to, or
otherwise have an adverse impact on, the Business or any of the Purchased
Assets. Parent and the Companies shall provide written notice to Buyer not
less than five (5) Business Days prior to taking any action described in
_clause (i)_ or _(ii)_ above.

such assistance or take any actions in respect of the foregoing where such
assistance or actions would reasonably be expected to result in any Loss to,
or otherwise have an adverse impact on, the Business or any of the Purchased
Assets.

Reimbursements with respect to any Improvement Project to an amount less than
the agreed upon budgeted amounts for such Landlord Reimbursements set forth in
_Schedule 2(f)_ ( _clauses (A)_ through _(D)_ inclusive, the " _Improvement
Restrictions_ "). Following prior notice from Buyer, Parent and the Companies
shall provide Buyer reasonable access to the Leased Premises at which the

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable

Projects as promptly as reasonably practicable. All Improvement Projects
completed or caused to be completed by Buyer following the Closing shall be
completed in accordance with the Improvement Standards. In completing the

its Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of Parent in each
instance (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), take any action included within the Improvement Restrictions.
Following prior notice from Parent, Marcus and Buyer shall provide Parent and
its representatives reasonable access to the Leased Premises at which the

Improvement Expenses paid, and all Landlord Reimbursements received (or
reasonably expected to be received), by Parent and the Companies prior to the
Closing (the " _Pre-Closing Amounts_ "), including reasonable supporting
written evidence of all such Improvement Expenses and Landlord
Reimbursements. As soon as reasonably practicable following the completion of
the last Improvement Project to be completed, Buyer shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Parent (i) a correct and complete statement of all
Improvement Expenses paid, and all Landlord Reimbursements received (or
reasonably expected to be received), by Buyer following the Closing (the "

all such Improvement Expenses and Landlord Reimbursements; and (ii) based on
such Post-Closing Amounts and the Pre-Closing Amounts, a calculation of (A)
the aggregate amount of all Improvement Expenses, (B) the aggregate amount of
all Landlord Reimbursements, (C) the Net Improvement Expenses Amount and (D)
the Net Improvement Expenses Overage Amount (the " _Proposed
Improvement Calculations_ "). In the event of any dispute among the parties

accordance with the procedures described in _Section 2.5(c)_ _mutatis
mutandis_.

  



  

(d) If the Net Improvement Expenses Overage Amount is a positive
number, then (i) Buyer shall be entitled to retain all Luxury
Reimbursements actually received by Buyer and its Affiliates prior to the
date on which the Net Improvement Expenses Overage Amount is
finally determined pursuant to _Section 5.25(c)_ up to the amount of the Net
Improvement Expenses Overage Amount, and (ii) if such retained Luxury
Reimbursements are less than the Net Improvement Expenses Overage Amount, then
within five (5) Business Days after the date on which the Net Improvement
Expenses Overage Amount is finally determined pursuant to _Section 5.25(c)_ ,
Buyer and Parent shall deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow
Agent directing the Escrow Agent to distribute to Buyer cash in the amount of
such shortfall from the Escrow Fund.

directors, employees, members, partners, equity holders, representatives,
fiduciaries, managers and agents (each a " _Buyer Indemnitee_ ") from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred as a result of or arising
from or relating to (i) any breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or
warranty made by any Company or Parent in _Article 3_ or in any certificate
or Interim Liquor Agreement delivered by any Company or Parent pursuant to

Section 8.3. _Third Party Claims; Notice of Other Claims_.

  



  

(a) If an Action by a Person who is not a party hereto or an
Affiliate thereof (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") is made in writing against any
Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2_ (an "
_Indemnified Party_ "), and if such Indemnified Party intends to seek
indemnity with respect thereto under this _Article 8_ , such Indemnified Party
shall promptly give a Notice of Claim to the party obligated to indemnify
such Indemnified Party (such notified party, the " _Responsible Party_ ");
_provided_ that the failure to give such Notice of Claim shall not relieve the
Responsible Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
Responsible Party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby. The
Responsible Party shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to
assume (by written notice to the Indemnified Party) the conduct and control,
through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and at the
expense of the Responsible Party, of the settlement or defense thereof, and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Responsible Party in connection
therewith; _provided_  that the Responsible Party acknowledges in writing
that it has an indemnification obligation hereunder with respect to any
Losses that may be incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
Third Party Claim; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Responsible Party
shall not be entitled to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim if (i) such
Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against any
Indemnified Party, (ii) an Indemnified Party is advised by counsel that an
actual or potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the
Responsible Party in connection with the defense of the Third Party Claim,
(iii) the Third Party Claim relates to or otherwise arises in connection with
any criminal or regulatory enforcement action (other than an action with
respect to Taxes), investigation, suit or proceeding or (iv) settlement of, an
adverse judgment with respect to, or conduct of the defense of the Third
Party Claim by the Responsible Party is, in the good faith judgment of the
Indemnified Party, likely to be adverse to the Indemnified Party's reputation
or continuing business interests. If the Responsible Party assumes control of
the defense of any Third Party Claim, then the Responsible Party shall permit
the Indemnified Party to participate in such settlement or defense through
counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party (the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party). For the avoidance of
doubt, any fees and expenses of separate counsel retained by any Indemnified
Party that are incurred after the expiration of the thirty (30) day period set
forth above and prior to the Responsible Party's assumption of control of the
defense of the Third Party Claim shall be subject to indemnification
hereunder. So long as the Responsible Party is reasonably and diligently
contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay
or settle any such claim. If the Responsible Party elects to conduct the
defense and settlement of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
retain the right to pay or settle such Third Party Claim; _provided_ that, in
such event, it shall waive any right to indemnity hereunder for all Losses
related to such claim unless the Responsible Party shall have consented
to such payment or settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). The Responsible Party shall not, except with the
consent of the Indemnified Party compromise, enter into any settlement or
consent to entry of any judgment that (w) imposes any injunctive relief or
other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party, (x) does not include as
a term thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such claim to all
Indemnified Parties of an express and unconditional release from all
liability with respect to such claim, (y) requires any monetary payment (other
than a payment subject to the Threshold) which is not concurrently paid in
full by the Responsible Party or (z) involves any finding or admission of any
violation of any Law or the rights of any Persons. If the Responsible Party
does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after
the receipt of the Indemnified Party's Notice of Claim hereunder that it
elects to undertake the defense thereof, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to contest, settle or compromise the claim but shall not thereby waive
any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement.

  



    

 | 71| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) All of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of any Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder and the Indemnified Party (or a duly authorized
representative of such party) shall furnish such records, information and
testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings,
trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith;
_provided_ that, if the interests of the parties become adverse to one
another, then the parties shall comply with the applicable rules of discovery
and shall not be permitted to rely on this _Section 8.3(b)_.

  



  

(c) In the event that any Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim
for indemnification under this _Article 8_ , the Indemnified Party shall give
a Notice of Claim to the Responsible Party within any applicable time
limitations contained in _Section 8.1_. Any such notice shall describe (i)
the breach or inaccuracy, Excluded Liability or Fraud upon which such claim is
based in reasonable detail in light of the facts then known to the
Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnified Party's reasonable good faith
estimate of the amount of Losses related to such breach or inaccuracy,
Excluded Liability or Fraud for which the Indemnified Party may be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this _Article 8_ ; _provided_ that no defect in
the information contained in such notice from the Indemnified Party to the
Responsible Party will relieve such Responsible Party from any obligation
under this _Article 8_ , except to the extent such failure to include
information actually and materially prejudices such Responsible Party.

  



  

Section 8.4. _Limitations on Indemnification Obligations_. The
rights to indemnification pursuant to the provisions of _Section 8.2_  are
subject to the following limitations:

  



  

(a) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover Losses
pursuant to _clause (i)_ of _Section 8.2(a)_ until the total amount which the
Buyer Indemnitees would be entitled to recover under _clause (i)_ of _Section
8.2(a)_ (as limited by the other provisions of this _Section 8.4_ ) exceeds
$650,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), in which case the Buyer Indemnitees shall
only be entitled to recover Losses in excess of such amount, and in no event
shall the aggregate recovery of Losses by Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to
_clause (i)_ of _Section 8.2(a)_ exceed $10,000,000, subject to the other
limitations set forth in this _Section 8.4_ ; _provided_ that this _Section
8.4(a)_ shall not apply to Losses suffered or incurred as a result of or
arising from or relating to any breach of, or inaccuracy in any Fundamental
Representation.

(b) with respect to any Losses for which the Buyer Indemnitees may
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _clause (i)_ of _Section 8.2(a)_ ,
Parent shall not be liable for any individual or series of related Losses
which do not exceed $50,000 (which Losses shall not be counted towards the
Threshold); _provided_ that this _Section 8.4(b)_ shall not apply to Losses
suffered or incurred as a result of or arising from or relating to any breach
of or inaccuracy in any Fundamental Representation.

  



  

(c) in no event shall the aggregate recovery of Losses by Buyer
Indemnitees pursuant to _clause (i)_ of _Section 8.2(a)_ with respect to any
breach of a Fundamental Representation, or pursuant to any of clauses _(ii)_ ,
_(iii)_ or _(iv)_ of  _Section 8.2(a)_ , exceed the Purchase Price, in each
case, subject to the other limitations set forth in this _Section 8.4_ ;

  



  

(d) the amount of any Losses recoverable by Buyer Indemnitee

Buyer Indemnitee from any third party in respect of such Losses; and (iii)

case of _clause (ii)_ and _(iii)_ , net of any deductibles or other
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Buyer Indemnitee in procuring
such recovery; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) if Parent or any Company
pays to any Buyer Indemnitee an amount in respect of Losses and any Buyer
Indemnitee thereafter receives from a third party a sum in respect of such
Losses, then Buyer shall promptly tender to Parent an amount equal to
the lesser of such sum and the amount that Parent or such Company paid in
respect of such Losses; and (B) Buyer shall, and shall cause the other Buyer
Indemnitees to, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain available
recoveries as contemplated by _clauses (ii)_ and _(iii)_ of this _Section
8.4(d)_ ; _provided_ that such commercially reasonable efforts shall not
obligate Buyer or any Buyer Indemnitee to expend any amount of money other
than _de minimis_ amounts (unless such other amounts are advanced by Parent
or the Companies), commence any Action, or otherwise take any action that
could reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the Business;

  



  

(e) no party shall be liable for any punitive or exemplary damages
(except to the extent paid in connection with a Third Party Claim or Fraud);
and

or repairs, (ii) in connection with any improvement, remodel or development
activity at any Theatre, (iii) as required by Law or at the direction of a

on indemnification set forth in _Section 8.4_ ) shall be paid exclusively
from the then remaining balance of the Escrow Fund, by release of funds to
such Buyer Indemnitee by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Escrow Agreement, and the release of such funds shall

Representation, or (ii) any of clauses _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ or _(iv)_ of
_Section 8.2(a)_ (in each case, including any amounts adjudicated due upon
judgment or other judicial or arbitral determination, unless appealed, or
agreed to be paid by settlement or compromise of a Third Party Claim, and
after giving effect to the limitations on indemnification set forth in
_Section 8.4_ ) shall be paid first from the then remaining balance of the
Escrow Fund, by release of funds to such Buyer Indemnitee by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, and the
release of such funds shall accordingly reduce the balance of the Escrow
Fund, and in the event that the then remaining balance of the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to pay the entire amount payable to the Buyer Indemnitee, Parent
and the Companies, jointly and severally, shall pay the remaining amount
payable to the Buyer Indemnitee by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by the applicable Buyer Indemnitee

or any Company hereunder, including any positive Actual Adjustment, Virtual
Print Fees, Luxury Reimbursements or Payment Dispute recoveries). Any amount
payable by Buyer to any Parent Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article 8_

or compromise of a Third Party Claim) shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
applicable Parent Indemnitee within fifteen (15) days after the determination
thereof.

required by applicable Law to mitigate all Losses incurred or reasonably
expected to be incurred by it or any Indemnified Party it controls upon

shall reasonably cooperate with each other to the extent permitted by
applicable Law with respect to resolving any claim or liability underlying

hereunder.

Section 10.3. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the rights of the
parties hereunder and any Action in any way arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether at law
or in equity, and whether sounding in contract or in tort or otherwise) shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

  



  

Section 10.4. _Jurisdiction and Venue_. Subject to the dispute
resolution procedures provided in _Section 2.5(d)_ , each of the
parties hereto submits to the exclusive jurisdiction first in any federal

the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 10.2_. Nothing in
this _Section 10.4_ , however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law. Each party hereto agrees
that a final, non-appealable judgment in any Action so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment in any jurisdiction or

Section 10.5. _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in
this Agreement, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Ancillary
Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the

incurring such fees or expenses.

  



  

Section 10.6. _Construction; Interpretation_. The term "this
Agreement" means this Asset Purchase Agreement together with all
Schedules and Exhibits hereto, as the same may from time to time be amended,
modified, supplemented or restated in accordance with the terms hereof. The
headings contained in this Agreement are inserted for convenience only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
No party hereto, nor its respective counsel, shall be deemed the drafter of
this Agreement for purposes of construing or enforcing the provisions hereof,
and all provisions of this Agreement shall be construed according to their
fair meaning and not strictly for or against any party, and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Person by virtue of
its authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Unless otherwise indicated
to the contrary herein by the context or use thereof: (a) the words,
"herein," "hereto," "hereof" and words of similar import refer to this
Agreement as a whole, including the Schedules and Exhibits, and not to any
particular section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph or clause contained
in this Agreement; (b) masculine gender shall also include the feminine and
neutral genders, and vice versa; (c) words importing the singular shall also
include the plural, and vice versa; (d) the words "include," "includes" or
"including" shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation";
(e) the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to
which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply
"if"; (f) the words "dollar" and "$" mean dollars in the lawful currency of
the United States of America; and (g) the word "or" shall not be deemed to be
exclusive (i.e., "or" shall mean "and/or").

  



  

Section 10.7. _Exhibits and Schedules_. All Exhibits and Schedules
hereto are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part
hereof as if set out in full in this Agreement. Any item disclosed on any
Schedule referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed
to have been disclosed with respect to each other section in this Agreement
with respect to which the relevance of such disclosure to such other section
is reasonably apparent on its face. The specification of any dollar amount in
the representations or warranties contained in this Agreement or the inclusion
of any specific item in any Schedule is not intended to imply that such
amounts, or higher or lower amounts or the items so included or other items,
are or are not material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of
such amounts or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or
controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described
herein or included in a Schedule is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.8. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party and its successors and
permitted assigns and, except as provided in _Article 8_ , nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Buyer
Indemnitees and Parent Indemnitees not party hereto are intended third party
beneficiaries of, and shall have the right to enforce, _Article 8_ of this
Agreement, and (ii) the third parties not party hereto that are referred to

Section 10.9. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of
this Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and
valid under applicable Law, but if any term or other provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable
Law, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as
to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

Section 10.10. _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law, this Agreement
may be amended or modified only by written agreement executed and delivered by
duly authorized officers of Buyer, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other
hand. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except as provided in the

parties hereto effected in a manner which does not comply with this _Section
10.10_ shall be null and void.

herein. Buyer may, at any time, (x) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the Companies or Parent contained

and warranties of the Companies or Parent contained herein or in any document,
certificate or writing delivered by the Companies or Parent pursuant hereto
or (z) waive compliance by the Companies or Parent with any of the agreements
or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of any party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Any waiver of any term or condition
shall not be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach or a
prior or subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any
other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any party hereto to
assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

  



  

Section 10.12. _Counterparts; Facsimile Signatures_. This Agreement
may be executed in multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be
an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

manually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 10.14. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. The parties to this Agreement
each hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any right to
trial by jury of any Action (a) arising under this Agreement or (b) in any way
connected with or related or incidental to the dealings of the parties hereto
in respect of this Agreement or any of the transactions related hereto, in
each case, whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in
contract, tort, equity, or otherwise. Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby agrees and consents that any such Action shall be decided by court
trial without a jury and that the parties to this Agreement may file an
original counterpart of a copy of this Agreement with any court as written
evidence of the consent of the parties hereto to the waiver of their right to
trial by jury.

  



  

Section 10.15. _No Recourse_. No shareholder or member (other than,
in the case of the Companies, Parent), director, manager, officer, employee
or agent of Parent or the Companies shall have any responsibility or
obligation with respect to any Liability or agreement of Parent or the
Companies under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement (unless such Person
is a party thereto). No shareholder or member (other than, in the case of
Buyer, Marcus), director, manager, officer, employee or agent of Buyer or
Marcus shall have any responsibility or obligation with respect to any
Liability or agreement of Buyer or Marcus under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement (unless such Person is a party thereto).

  



  

Section 10.16. _Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary damages, even if available, may not be an adequate
remedy, may occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that each party hereto shall be entitled to seek an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, this being in addition to any other remedy to which such
party is entitled at law or in equity.
