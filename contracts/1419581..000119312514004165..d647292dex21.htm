Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any Ancillary

Interest or a violation of any applicable Laws, or such Interest is not

neither this Agreement nor any Ancillary Agreement shall constitute a

therewith) and pending such Consent (i) Seller Parent and Purchaser shall
cooperate in any reasonable and lawful arrangements (that do not violate the
terms of the relevant Retained Interest) designed to provide to Purchaser the
benefits, and for Purchaser to assume the burdens, of such Retained Interest,
in which case Purchaser shall promptly pay or satisfy the corresponding
Liabilities to the extent Purchaser would have been responsible therefor if
such Retained Interest had been transferred to Purchaser at the Closing, (ii)
Seller Parent shall hold, or cause the relevant Seller to hold, for and pay to
Purchaser in the ordinary course all income, proceeds and other monies
received by Sellers in connection with their use of any Retained Interests

Affiliates) in connection with the arrangements under this Section 1.5 and
enforce, at the request of Purchaser, any rights of Sellers arising from
such Retained Interest against the issuer thereof or the other party or
parties thereto (including the right to elect to terminate any such Retained
Interest in accordance with the terms thereof upon the advice of Purchaser).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller Parent shall promptly reimburse
Purchaser for fifty percent (50%) of out-of-pocket costs incurred by Purchaser
in connection with obtaining consents under Contracts with customers and
suppliers of the Business, to the extent required in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and not obtained as of the Closing Date, up
to an aggregate amount of such reimbursements not to exceed $500,000.

promptly provide to Purchaser such assistance as may be reasonably required
for each to meet their obligations on a timely basis under any Contract or in
relation to any Retained Interest.

   (c) |

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that to the extent that Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates are allowed the benefits or use of any Retained
Interest pursuant to this Section 1.5 while any Consent relating thereto has
not been obtained, Purchaser shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against, and shall pay
to the relevant Seller Indemnified Party promptly upon receipt of any invoice
from a Seller Indemnified Party, all Losses incurred by any Seller Indemnified
Party under or in relation to

Retained Interest by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or as a result of

any item of Capex) has not been calculated in accordance with the definition
thereof. If, by the end of the Final Date, there still exist one or more such
unresolved disputed items but neither party shall have delivered a Submission
Notice to the other party, the calculation of all such unresolved disputed
items and the Purchase Price as reflected on the Notice of Disagreement shall
be deemed final and binding on the parties and, at such time, the Proposed
Closing Statement as modified to reflect such resolution shall be deemed the
Final Closing Statement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | The parties shall instruct the Accounting Firm to
determine the disputed items set forth in any Submission Notice in accordance
with the definitions thereof and, in respect of any item or entry other than
Spent Capex, in accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles and,
subject to Section 2.2(d)(iv), to make only such revisions or amendments as
may be required to the Proposed Closing Statement such that the Final Closing
Statement accurately reflects Spent Capex, Closing Date Net Working Capital
and Closing Date Net Debt, and the resulting Purchase Price, as prepared in
accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles in the case of all of the
foregoing other than Spent Capex. Seller Parent and Purchaser shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to render a
determination as to such disputed items and the resulting Purchase Price,
along with a statement of reasons therefor, within 30 days after
the engagement of the Accounting Firm (as evidenced by its written acceptance
by facsimile or otherwise to the parties) or a reasonable time thereafter,
and, absent fraud or manifest error, such determination of the Accounting Firm
shall be final and binding upon Seller Parent and Purchaser. Seller Parent
and Purchaser shall provide the Accounting Firm, without charge, access to
information and representatives as reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm
to the extent required for the determination of the Final Closing Statement. 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 21 be limited to whether the calculations of (i) the amounts of the items
required to be set forth in the Proposed Closing Statement were calculated
strictly in accordance with the definitions in this Agreement relating
thereto and (ii) Closing Date Net Working Capital and Closing Date Net Debt
set forth in the Proposed Closing Statement were performed strictly in
accordance with the Specified Accounting Principles. The determination of any
item in dispute cannot, however, be in excess of, nor less than, the greatest
or lowest value, respectively, claimed for that particular item in the
Proposed Closing Statement, in the case of Seller Parent, or in the Notice of
Disagreement, in the case of Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be shared
equally by Seller Parent and Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 



   (e) | No later than five (5) Business Days after the Proposed Closing
Statement is deemed the Final Closing Statement pursuant to this Section 2.2: 
---|--- 
 



     | (i) | If the Final Closing Date Net Debt (A) is more than the
Estimated Closing Date Net Debt, Seller Parent shall pay to Purchaser the
difference or (B) is less than the Estimated Closing Date Net Debt,
Purchaser shall pay to Seller Parent, on behalf of itself and the other
Sellers, the difference; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital (A) is less
than the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, Seller Parent shall pay
to Purchaser the difference or (B) is more than the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay to Seller Parent, on behalf of
itself and the other Sellers, the difference; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | If the Final Spent Capex (A) is less than the Estimated
Spent Capex, Seller Parent shall pay to Purchaser the difference or (B) is
more than the Estimated Spent Capex, Purchaser shall pay to Seller Parent,
on behalf of itself and the other Sellers, the difference. 
---|---|--- 

Any amount to be paid pursuant to this Section 2.2(e) shall be (i) increased
by interest thereon at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum from (but
excluding) the Closing Date through and including the date of payment based on
a 365-day year; (ii) made by a wire transfer of immediately available funds
in Dollars to a bank account designated in writing by the party entitled to
receive payment (such designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days
prior to such payment) and (iii) treated as an adjustment to the Initial
Purchase Price for Tax reporting purposes. The parties shall net the payments,
if any, to be made pursuant to Sections 2.2(e)(i) and 2.2(e)(ii) such that
only one party is required to deliver amounts required to be paid under
this Section 2.2(e).

 



Page 22 Purchase Price allocated to the Equity Interests in each of the Transferred
Entities (other than Equity Interests in Transferred Entities owned by
other Transferred Entities) and to the other Transferred Assets (and among
the Transferred Assets) of each Seller (net of Assumed Liabilities) shall be
as set forth on _Schedule 2.3B_ , which Schedule 2.3B shall be agreed between
Purchaser and Seller Parent within a reasonable time prior to the Closing,
and attached hereto at such time. Schedule 2.3B shall be prepared based upon
and using the methodologies contained in Schedule 2.3A attached hereto, with
such adjustments thereto as the Purchaser and Seller Parent may agree. A
proposed draft of Schedule 2.3B shall be prepared by Seller Parent and
delivered to Purchaser at least 30 days prior to the Closing. Purchaser shall
notify Seller Parent of any proposed revisions to Schedule 2.3 at least 20
days prior to the Closing. If Seller Parent and Purchaser are unable to agree
on a final version of Schedule 2.3B or any revisions thereto at least 15 days
prior to the Closing, any dispute shall be resolved pursuant to
procedures comparable to the procedures applicable under Section 2.2(d)(ii).
Following the Closing and the determination of the Final Closing Statement,
the parties shall adjust Schedule 2.3B, using the same methodology as that
used in the agreed Schedule 2.3B to reflect the allocation of the Purchase
Price (as adjusted under Section 2.2) and the Assumed Liabilities (to the
extent treated as liabilities for United States federal income tax purposes)
among the Equity Interests in each of the Transferred Entities (other than
Equity Interests in Transferred Entities owned by other Transferred Entities)
and the other Transferred Assets (and among the Transferred Assets) of each
Seller (" _Revised Schedule 2.3B_ "). Revised Schedule 2.3B as finally agreed
upon shall be binding on the parties for federal, state, local, foreign and
other Tax reporting purposes, including filings on Internal Revenue Service
Form 8594, and no party will assert or maintain a position inconsistent with
this allocation. 
---|--- 



   2.4 | _Romanian Investment Reimbursements_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) | From and after the Closing, promptly (and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days) after receipt of any Romanian Investment
Reimbursement by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including Honeywell
Romania), Purchaser shall forward, or cause Honeywell Romania or the relevant
Affiliate to forward, to Seller Parent (or an Affiliate thereof as instructed
by Seller Parent) by a wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated by Seller Parent, an amount in cash equal to such Romanian
Investment Reimbursement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) |

Following Closing until such time as all Romanian Investment Reimbursements
have been fully paid by the applicable Governmental Authorities,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including Honeywell Romania)
to, (i) comply with their respective obligations under the Romanian Investment
Scheme (including any applications and investment plans submitted thereunder);
(ii) use their commercially reasonable efforts to seek payment from the
applicable Governmental Authorities of the Romanian Investment Reimbursements
and keep Seller Parent reasonably informed as to developments relating thereto
and (iii) promptly notify Seller Parent in writing of any Romanian Investment 

---|---|--- 
 



Page 23 (including Honeywell Romania). Sellers shall be entitled (at their own
expense) from time to time on reasonable notice to Purchaser, to examine, and
have their representatives (including their accountants) examine, during
normal business hours, the books and records of the Business and Honeywell
Romania to the extent reasonably requested to verify Purchasers compliance
with this Section 2.4. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | In the event that Purchaser or one of its Affiliates is
required to make any payments to any Governmental Authority in respect of or
as reimbursement of any Romanian Investment Reimbursements paid to Honeywell
Romania or its Affiliates, Purchaser shall notify Seller Parent in writing
within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt by Purchaser of the repayment
request, and if such requirement has not resulted from a breach or failure to
perform by Purchaser of its obligations under Section 2.4(b) or by Purchaser
or its Affiliates (including Honeywell Romania following Closing) of any
obligations under the Romanian Investment Scheme or Romanian Investment Aid
Documentation, Seller Parent shall pay by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a bank account designated by Purchaser an amount in cash
equal to the amount of such required payments not later than ten (10) Business
Days following receipt of such notice, and Purchaser shall promptly remit, or
cause its Affiliate to remit, such amount to the applicable Governmental
Authority. 
---|---|--- 



     | (d) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
with respect to the reimbursement requests not yet filed as of the Closing by
Honeywell Romania with the applicable Governmental Authorities for any
eligible expenses incurred by Honeywell Romania prior to Closing, Seller
Parent and Purchaser shall, subject to applicable Law, provide Purchaser with
meaningful input into the preparation of reimbursement requests, and Honeywell
Romania will file them with the applicable Governmental Authorities.
Purchaser and Honeywell Romania assume no liability or obligation under this
Agreement with respect to the acceptance by the applicable Governmental
Authorities of such reimbursement requests, other than providing the
information reasonably requested by the applicable Governmental Authorities.
Any amounts paid to Honeywell Romania by the applicable Governmental
Authorities under these reimbursement requests to the extent the same
constitute Romanian Investment Reimbursements shall be paid to Seller Parent
in accordance with Section 2.4(e). For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall
not be required to remit to Seller Parent any amount received pursuant to the
Romanian Investment Scheme that does not constitute a Romanian Investment
Reimbursement. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Any payments under this Section 2.4 shall be made in
Dollars, and any amount comprising any Romanian Investment Reimbursement that
is valued in a currency other than Dollars shall be converted into Dollars on
the basis of the currency to Dollar relevant exchange rate published by the
National Bank of Romania on the date that is ten (10) Business Days before the
actual date of payment hereunder. The parties agree that any payment pursuant
to this Section 2.4 shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 24 ---|--- 



   (a) | As additional consideration (the " _Earn-Out Consideration_ ")
for the Equity Interests and Transferred Assets, Purchaser shall pay to Seller
Parent (on behalf of Sellers) an amount, if any, equal to: (i) Three Million
Dollars ($3,000,000.00) if the Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin exceeds five
percent (5%); and (ii) an additional Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000.00) if
the Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin exceeds seven percent (7%) (it being
understood that the amounts set forth in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)
are cumulative and not alternative), in each case in accordance with this
Section 2.5. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Earn-Out
Consideration payable to Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.5 exceed Five
Million Dollars ($5,000,000.00) in the aggregate (the " _Maximum Earn-Out
Consideration Amount_ "). 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | Following the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) to, (i) maintain adequate
financial records for, and allocate costs to, the Combined Business
in accordance with Purchasers internal reporting policies and requirements
and US GAAP; and (ii) not take or omit to take any actions with a purpose or
intention to avoid, reduce, or otherwise frustrate the payment of the Earn-
Out Consideration. 
---|--- 



   (c) | With respect to each of Fiscal Year 2016 and Fiscal Year 2017, no
later than 10 days after the filing of Purchasers annual report on Form 10-K
with the SEC for such fiscal year or, if Purchaser is no longer required to
file such report or if such report is not timely filed by Purchaser, no later
than 75 days after the end of such fiscal year, Purchaser shall prepare (or
cause to be prepared) and deliver to Seller Parent financial statements
(the " _Earn-Out Financial Statements_ ") prepared in accordance with US GAAP
consistently applied and consisting of a balance sheet and statements of
income, changes in stockholders equity and cash flows of the Combined Business
as of the end of, and for, such fiscal year, together with calculations of
(i) in respect of the Earn-Out Financial Statements delivered for Fiscal Year
2016, the Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Revenue for Fiscal Year 2016
and (ii) in respect of the Earn-Out Financial Statements delivered for Fiscal
Year 2017, the Combined Adjusted EBITDA and Combined Revenue for Fiscal Year
2017 and the resulting calculation of the Combined Adjusted EBITDA Margin.
Following delivery of any Earn-Out Financial Statements to Seller Parent,
Purchaser agrees to provide Seller Parent and its accountants and
representatives access to the books and records of the Combined Business to
the extent reasonably requested by Seller Parent in connection with its
review of the Earn-Out Financial Statements and will cause appropriate
personnel of Purchaser and the Combined Business to provide reasonable
assistance to Seller Parent and its representatives for the purpose of
reviewing the Earn-Out Financial Statements. Purchaser shall, at no cost to
Purchaser, permit Seller Parents accountants to review and make copies of all
work papers used to support account balances in the Earn-Out Financial
Statements. 
---|--- 
 



Page 25 Earn-Out Financial Statements delivered pursuant to Section 2.5(c), Seller
Parent shall deliver a notice (an " _Earn-Out Dispute Notice_") to such
effect no later than forty-five (45) Business Days after delivery of the Earn-
Out Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2017 (it being understood
that Seller Parent shall be entitled to object to the Earn-Out Financial
Statements for Fiscal Year 2016 and discuss the same with Purchaser prior to
such date without prejudice to its rights hereunder), and any such dispute
shall be resolved under the procedures set forth in clauses (i), (ii), (iii)
and (v) of Section 2.2(d) of this Agreement (with the provisions of such
Section relating to disputed items set forth in a Notice of Disagreement
applying _mutatis mutandis_ to disputed items set forth in an Earn-Out
Dispute Notice, except that references to Specified Accounting Principles
shall be deemed to refer to US GAAP consistently applied). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | If Seller Parent is entitled to payment of any Earn-Out
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.5, Purchaser shall pay to Seller
Parent (on behalf of all Sellers) an amount in cash equal to the applicable
Earn-Out Consideration (i) within five (5) Business Days after expiration of
the forty-five (45) Business Day period after delivery of the Earn-Out
Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2017 if Seller Parent does not deliver an
Earn-Out Dispute Notice within such forty-five (45) Business Day period or
(ii) within five (5) Business Days of the final resolution of all disputed
items set forth in an Earn-Out Dispute Notice delivered pursuant to Section
2.5(d), in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Seller Parent. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | If an Earn-Out Acceleration Event occurs following the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller Parent (on
behalf of all Sellers) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by Seller Parent, an amount in cash
equal to the Maximum Earn-Out Consideration Amount no later than five (5)
Business Days following the occurrence of the applicable Earn-Out Acceleration
Event. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, promptly notify
Seller Parent in writing promptly following the entry into an agreement or
other understanding in respect of an Earn-Out Acceleration Event. 
---|---|--- 
 



   3. | _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER PARENT_. 
---|--- 

Seller Parent hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser, except as set
forth on (but subject to Section 12.8) the Disclosure Schedule, as follows:

 



Page 26 ---|--- 

Each of the Sellers and the Transferred Entities is a legal entity of the
type described in _Schedule 3.1_ , duly organized, validly existing and, with
respect to entities organized within the US and any other jurisdiction outside
the US in which the concept of good standing or its functional equivalent is
applicable, in good standing or its functional equivalent under the Laws of
the jurisdiction indicated in _Schedule 3.1_. Each of the Sellers and the
Transferred Entities is duly qualified to transact business in any
jurisdiction where the ownership or leasing of the Transferred Assets and the
conduct of the Business require it to be so qualified except where the failure
to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate with other such
failures, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Sellers
and the Transferred Entities have all requisite corporate power and authority
to conduct the Business as it is now being conducted by them and to enter into
and perform their respective obligations under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements to which they are contemplated to be parties.



   3.2 | _Authority_. 
---|--- 

The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each of the
Ancillary Agreements contemplated to be executed and delivered at the Closing
by Seller Parent, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of Seller Parent. The execution, delivery and performance of each of
the Ancillary Agreements contemplated to be executed and delivered at the
Closing will, as of the execution thereof by each of the Sellers (other than
Seller Parent), and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
the part of such Seller. Upon execution by each relevant Seller, this
Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement to which Sellers are a party shall
have been duly executed and delivered by such Seller and shall be enforceable
against such Seller in accordance with its terms except to the extent that (i)
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to creditors
rights generally and is subject to general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law)
and (ii) specific performance may not be available in certain jurisdictions
outside the US (the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the "
_Enforceability Exceptions_ ").

 



   3.3 | _Transferred Entities; Title to Equity Interests_. 
---|--- 

The copies of the organizational documents of the Transferred Entities, which
have been made available to Purchaser, are true, accurate and complete in all
material respects. For each Transferred Entity, _Schedule 3.3_ sets forth (a)
the nature of the equity interest held by Sellers or, as applicable, a
Transferred Entity, (b) the number of such equity interests that are
outstanding, and (c) the number and percentage of the outstanding equity
interests held by Sellers (each such equity interest, an " _Equity Interest_
"). Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.3_ , the Equity Interests constitute,
and on the Closing Date will constitute, all of the issued and outstanding
equity of each Transferred Entity. Upon delivery by Sellers of the
Equity Interests at the Closing, good and valid title to all of the Equity
Interests will pass to Purchaser (or, in the case of the Equity Interests
owned by Transferred Entities, will be held by such Transferred Entities),
free and clear of all 

 



Page 27  Encumbrances, other than transfer restrictions imposed by national, federal
or state securities laws, Encumbrances created by Purchaser or its Affiliates
(or its or their respective officers, directors, employees or agents), or
Encumbrances otherwise arising as a result of any facts or circumstances
relating solely to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (or its respective
officers, directors, employees or agents). Except as set forth on  _Schedule
3.3_ , all Equity Interests have been duly issued in compliance with
applicable Law, and are fully paid and nonassessable. All contributions have
been made in compliance with applicable Law. There are no securities of the
Transferred Entities convertible into or exchangeable for shares. There are
no outstanding obligations of the Sellers or of the Transferred Entities to
repurchase or otherwise acquire Equity Interests. Except as set forth in
_Schedule 3.3_ , no third party has with respect to the Equity Interests any
right of first refusal, option right or other right to acquire or demand a
transfer of the Equity Interests. The Equity Interests are not subject to any
silent partnership or sub-participation. Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.3_
, the Transferred Entities are not, and prior to the Closing Date will not
become, a party to or subject to any contract or obligation wherein any
person has a right or option to purchase or acquire any rights in any capital
stock or other equity securities of the Transferred Entities. None of the
Transferred Entities have or are obligated to acquire subsidiaries,
participations, sub-participations or investments in the equity capital of any
Person other than as set forth in _Schedule 3.3_.



   3.4 | _No Conflict_. 
---|--- 

Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.4_ , the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will not result in (a) the
breach of any term or provision of the charter, articles or certificate of
incorporation or any other organizational document or bylaws of any Seller or
Transferred Entity, or (b) assuming satisfaction of all Consent requirements
referred to in Section 3.5, the violation by any Seller or Transferred Entity
of any Law or any injunction, order, judgment, decree or other restriction of
any Governmental Authority applicable to such Seller or Transferred Entity,
except in the case of clause (b) above, for such breaches or violations, if
any, which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



   3.5 | _Governmental Consents_. 
---|--- 

Except as set forth in _Schedule 3.5_ , no Consent of any
Governmental Authority is required to be obtained or made by any of the
Sellers in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, other than: (a) as contemplated by Section
6.4(a), (b) Consents which, if not so made or obtained by Sellers would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Business if not received; and (c) as may be necessary as a result of any
facts or circumstances relating to solely Purchaser or any of their Affiliates
(or its or their respective officers, directors, employees or agents).

 



Page 28 ---|--- 

Sellers have made available to Purchaser (i) the unaudited
consolidated balance sheets of the Business as at December 31, 2011 and
December 31, 2012 (the " _Year-End Balance Sheets_ ") and the related
unaudited consolidated statements of income of the Business for the fiscal
years then ended (the " _Year-End Income Statements_ " and, together with the
Year-End Balance Sheets, the " _Year-End Financial Statements_ ") and (ii) the
unaudited interim consolidated balance sheet of the Business as at September
30, 2013 (the " _Interim Balance Sheet_ ") and the related unaudited interim
consolidated statements of income of the Business for the three months then
ended (the " _Interim Income Statements_ " and, together with the Interim
Balance Sheet and the Year-End Financial Statements, the " _Financial
Statements_ "). The Financial Statements present fairly in all material
respects the financial position and operating results of the Business as of
the dates thereof and for the periods covered thereby, in accordance with US
GAAP, consistently applied, subject to ordinary year-end audit adjustments and
the absence of footnote discussions.

not be so delivered prior to Closing, except that upon Purchasers reasonable
request such materials shall be delivered to Purchasers outside counsel for

make such disclosure in a form mutually acceptable to each of them.

 



   6.7 | _Guarantees_. 
---|--- 

Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, on or
before the Closing Date, (i) the release of each of the obligations of
Sellers or any Affiliate thereof (other than the Transferred Entities) to
guarantee Liabilities of the Business or of any Transferred Entity
(collectively, " _Sellers  Guarantees_"), including, without limitation, any
guarantees given under or in respect of any Transferred Contracts, and, to
that end, shall provide such guarantees or other credit support (including
letters of credit from third party lenders) as shall be required to obtain
such release and (ii) new letters of credit to substitute for and replace the
letters of credit extended by Sellers or any Affiliate thereof (other than a
Transferred Entity) on behalf of the Business or on behalf of any Transferred
Entity (" _Sellers  Letters of Credit_"), in each case effective as of the
Closing Date, it being the intention and understanding of Purchaser and
Sellers that such Sellers Guarantees and Sellers Letters of Credit shall,
to the extent agreed by the beneficiaries thereof, be cancelled and terminated
as of the Closing Date, and that Sellers and their Affiliates shall have no
further obligation or liability (contingent or otherwise) under such Sellers
Guarantees and Sellers Letters of Credit from and after the Closing Date.
Following Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers and
their Affiliates in respect of any payments required to be made under, and
any costs and expenses incurred in respect of, Sellers Guarantees and
Sellers Letters of Credit.



   6.8 | _Reasonable Efforts_. 
---|--- 

Without expanding Section 6.4 or 6.5, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall
use their reasonable efforts to satisfy, and to cooperate with and to assist
the other in satisfying, the conditions set forth in Article 8, so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible.

 



   6.9 | _Termination of Inter-Company Arrangements_. 
---|--- 
 



Page 56 required in connection with the Ancillary Agreements (including, the
Promissory Note) or as contemplated by Sections 6.9(b), (c), (d) or (e),
Seller Parent shall (i) cause any amounts owed to or by a Transferred Entity
from or to Sellers or other divisions or Affiliates of Sellers (other than the
trade accounts receivable or payable of Transferred Entities with other
Transferred Entities or other parts of the Business, as will be listed in
Schedule 3.27, updated as of the Effective Time) to be settled; (ii)
terminate, and shall cause its Affiliates to terminate, without liability to
Purchaser or the Transferred Entities, all Contracts and other arrangements
between the Seller Parent or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Entities), on the one hand, and any Transferred Entity, on the other hand,
other than as contemplated by the Ancillary Agreements. 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Transferred Entities to
distribute their respective Retained Cash to the applicable Seller on
or prior to the Closing Date to the extent permitted by, and in accordance
with, Applicable Law; provided, however, that if and to the extent a German
Transferred Entity is not permitted by, and in accordance with, applicable Law
to distribute all or a portion of its Retained Cash, it shall be permitted to
loan such Retained Cash to one or more other German Transferred Entities to
enable such Retained Cash to be distributed, and any such loans between German
Transferred Entities may remain outstanding as of the Closing Date. 
---|--- 



   (c) | In connection with the settlement of intercompany receivables and
payables of the Transferred Entities and the distribution of Retained Cash by
the Transferred Entities, at or prior to Closing Honeywell Deutschland
GmbH shall issue the Promissory Note to Honeywell Bremsbelag GmbH, and the
Promissory Note shall remain an asset of Honeywell Bremesbelag GmbH at and
after the Closing (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Promissory Note shall
not constitute Retained Cash for purposes of the calculation of Closing Date
Net Debt or Estimated Closing Date Net Debt, nor shall it be taken into
account in the calculation of Closing Date Net Working Capital or Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital).  
---|--- 



   (d) |

From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause all Indebtedness owed by
Honeywell Chongqing to Honeywell (China) Co. Ltd. (all such Indebtedness the
" _China Intercompany Indebtedness_ ") to be capitalized or settled (whether
via a capital increase or otherwise) on or prior to the Closing Date, to the
extent permitted by, and in accordance with, Applicable Law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, and subject to Section 6.9(e), to the extent that any China
Intercompany Indebtedness is not capitalized or otherwise settled on or prior
to Closing pursuant to this Section 6.9(d), the parties agree that the rights
of Honeywell (China) Co. Ltd. to payment in respect of such China Intercompany
Indebtedness will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, be transferred
to Purchaser (or a designated Affiliate 

---|--- 
 



Page 57 avoidance of doubt, neither the right to payment in respect of such China
Intercompany Indebtedness nor Honeywell Chongqings corresponding obligation
to make such payments shall be taken into account in the calculation of
Closing Date Net Debt, Estimated Closing Date Net Debt, Closing Date Net
Working Capital or Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital).  
---|--- 



   (e) | If within ten (10) Business Days of the date of this Agreement,
Purchaser proposes to Sellers in writing to address the China Intercompany
Indebtedness at the Closing pursuant to a detailed steps plan (the " _China
Steps Plan_ ") prepared by Purchasers advisors and, in Sellers reasonable
judgment, such assumption in accordance with the China Steps Plan can be
effected at the Closing without (i) delaying the timing at which the Closing
would otherwise occur or (ii) except to the extent that Purchaser agrees to
reimburse such amount, imposing any cost or other Loss or Liability on Sellers
or their Affiliates that would not otherwise be incurred in connection with
the repayment of such China Intercompany Indebtedness by Honeywell Chongqing
prior to Closing, then Sellers shall cause the China Intercompany Indebtedness
to be addressed in accordance with the China Steps Plan and included in the
Transferred Assets (and, for the avoidance of doubt, neither the right to
payment in respect of such China Intercompany Indebtedness nor Honeywell
Chongqings corresponding obligation to make such payments shall be taken into
account in the calculation of Closing Date Net Debt, Estimated Closing Date
Net Debt, Closing Date Net Working Capital or Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital). 
---|--- 



   6.10 | _Insurance_. 
---|--- 

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that, upon Closing, Sellers shall have no
obligation to maintain insurance coverage provided in relation to the
Business pursuant to policies, risk funding programs or arrangements
maintained by Sellers or by any of their Affiliates (whether such policies are
maintained in whole or in part with third party insurers or with Sellers or
their Affiliates and including any captive policies or fronting arrangements,
and including any "occurrence" based insurance policies provided in relation
to Sellers and their Affiliates with respect to any occurrences prior to
Closing). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser and Seller Parent shall,
and Seller Parent shall cause the other Sellers to, cooperate to recover under
any "occurrence" based insurance policies maintained with third party
insurers providing for coverage for indemnifiable Losses suffered from events
or damages occurring prior to the Closing in connection with the Business and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide access to such coverage
for any such Losses to the extent such coverage is available; and each party
shall take, at the requesting partys expense, all actions reasonably
requested by any other party to obtain such recovery.

 



Page 58 ---|--- 

From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall have the sole right to
conduct all Required Pre-Closing Product Recalls; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither Seller Parent nor its Affiliates shall have any Liability in
respect of any such Required Pre-Closing Product Recalls (including pursuant
to Section 11.1 hereof) to the extent arising out of or relating to actions
taken by Purchaser that are not required by legal authorities with
jurisdiction over such Required Pre-Closing Product Recall. Seller Parent
shall promptly notify Purchaser if Seller Parent receives notice in writing
that a recall of product of the Business sold prior to Closing or included in
the Business Inventory is required.



   6.12 | _TMD Claims_. 
---|--- 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including Section 6.1 and
Article 11 hereof), from the date hereof until the Closing, Seller Parent and
its Affiliates shall be entitled to compromise or settle any and all TMD
Claims in their sole and absolute discretion and any Losses payable by Seller
Parent or its Affiliates in connection with such settlement shall be paid by
Purchaser to Seller Parent at Closing up to an amount not exceeding the TMD
Claim Cap. Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict Seller Parent from
commencing and pursuing opposition proceedings at the European patent office
in respect of the technology patented in EP0654616B1.



   6.13 | _Pre-Closing Audit_. 
---|--- 



   (a) | Promptly following the date hereof, Seller Parent shall: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | provide Purchaser with unaudited financial information of
the Business for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2012 and December
31, 2013, which is reasonably sufficient to permit Purchaser to determine the
periods for which financial information may be required to be furnished by
Purchaser with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
Rule 3.05(b) of Regulation S-X (the " _Unaudited Financial Information_ ");
and  
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | cause, at no cost to Seller Parent or its Affiliates, the
financial statements of the Business for the twelve (12) month periods ended
December 31, 2013 (the " _2013 Financials_ ") to be audited in compliance
with applicable SEC rules and regulations (including Regulation S-X) and US
GAAP. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | Purchaser shall use reasonable best efforts to determine and
notify Seller Parent in writing, as promptly as possible and no later than
five (5) Business Days following delivery of the Unaudited
Financial Information (the " _Tolling Commencement Date_ "), whether, in the
opinion of counsel to Purchaser, financial information for the twelve (12)
month periods ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 is required to
be furnished by Purchaser with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby pursuant to Rule 3.05(b) of Regulation S-X. Promptly following delivery
of notice from Purchaser of the periods for which financial information is
required to be so furnished (each, a " _Required Financial_ Reporting
Period"), Seller Parent shall cause, at no cost to Seller Parent or its
Affiliates, the financial statements of the Business for each such Required
Financial Reporting Period to be audited in compliance with applicable SEC
rules and regulations (including Regulation S-X) and US GAAP. 
---|--- 
 



Page 59 of the audit of the 2013 Financials and (B) if the twelve (12) month period
ended December 31, 2012 is a Required Financial Reporting Period, the results
of the audit of the financial statements of the Business for such twelve (12)
month period (the " _2012 Financials_"), no later than ninety (90) days
following the date hereof; and (ii) if the twelve (12) month period ended
December 31, 2011 is a Required Financial Reporting Period, deliver to
Purchaser the results of the audit of the financial statements of the Business
for such twelve (12) month period (the " _2011 Financials_" and, together
with the 2013 Financials and the 2012 Financials, the " _Audit Financial
Statements_ ") no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days following the
date hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, in respect of the 2012
Financials and 2011 Financials, in the event that Purchaser shall have failed
to notify Seller Parent that the periods covered by such Audit Financial
Statements constitute Required Financial Reporting Periods by the Tolling
Commencement Date, the applicable due date for delivery of such Audit
Financial Statements under this Section 6.13(c) shall be automatically
extended for each day elapsed from the Tolling Commencement Date until the
date upon which Seller Parent was so notified by Purchaser. 
---|--- 



   (d) | Within 60 days of the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall deliver
unaudited financial statements for the latest completed interim quarterly
periods preceding the Closing Date and the corresponding prior year
interim quarterly periods to the extent such interim, unaudited, financial
statements are required by applicable Law (in the opinion of counsel to
Purchaser). 
---|--- 



   (e) | Purchaser shall not disclose (and shall keep strictly
confidential) any information delivered pursuant to this Section 6.13
(including any financial statements and audit results) to any Person prior to
Closing, except to the extent, and only at such time as, required by
applicable Law (in the opinion of counsel to Purchaser), including, without
limitation, (i) in connection any disclosure required to be made by Purchaser
under or pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (" _34
Act Disclosure_ "); (ii) as part of any offer or sale of securities registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _1933 Act_ "), undertaken
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (each a " _Registered Offering_ ") or
(iii) as part of any offer or sale of securities under Rule 144A of the 1933
Act undertaken by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (each a "
_144A Offering_ "), for which purpose the same disclosure requirements
(including as to timing of disclosure) as would be required as part of a
Registered Offering shall be deemed applicable. 
---|--- 
 



Page 60 notwithstanding the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, Purchaser shall be
permitted to include in any "34 Act Disclosure," Registered Offering or 144A
Offering or provide to banks and other financing sources in connection with
bank or similar financing, such selected or summary financial information
regarding the Business (including, without limitation, the revenues and EBITDA
of the Business and pro-forma financial information of Purchaser and the
Business on a combined basis) to the extent, and only at such times as,
required by applicable Law (in the opinion of counsel to Purchaser) in respect
of a Registered Offering or 144A Offering, or as may otherwise reasonably be
requested by the banks in connection with bank or similar financing or by the
underwriters of such Registered Offering or 144A Offering and provided that,
(i) in the case of a Registered Offering or a 144A Offering, such
underwriters have advised Purchaser and communicated to Seller Parent that, in
their good faith professional judgment, the failure to include such
information in the relevant Registered Offering or 144A Offering
documents, as applicable, would be materially detrimental to the successful
completion of such Registered Offering or 144A Offering documents, as
applicable, on then-prevailing market terms and (ii) in the case of banks or
similar financing sources, such banks or similar financing sources have
entered into confidentiality arrangements with Purchaser with respect to the
maintenance of confidentiality of such information on terms that are typical
for such arrangements in connection with such financing. 
---|--- 



   (g) | Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their
respective officers, directors, employees, auditors and representatives to, at
all times cooperate, at its own expense, with Seller Parent in
connection with the performance of Seller Parents obligations under this
Section 6.13. Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall promptly reimburse
Seller Parent for, all fees, costs and expenses of Seller Parent and its
Affiliates in connection with Seller Parents compliance with this Section
6.13, including, without limitation, any costs and expenses of auditors,
whether current or former auditors or auditors specifically engaged for the
purpose of compliance with this Section 6.13. Seller Parent shall be entitled
to control, in its sole discretion, the conduct of any audit required to be
performed hereunder and the engagement of auditors in connection therewith
(including such auditors scope of work and resources required to perform
such audit). 
---|--- 



   (h) | Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller Parent nor
any of its Affiliates (nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives) have made and, and none of them shall
be deemed to have made, and none of them will make, any representations or
warranties of any kind or character, express or implied, either herein or
otherwise, as to any information (including as to the accuracy or completeness
thereof) delivered to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.13 or the results
of any audit required to be performed hereunder. 
---|--- 



   (i) |

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at Law or in
equity, Purchasers sole and exclusive remedy for Seller Parents breach or
failure to perform any of its obligations under this Section 6.13 shall be
Purchasers right to 

---|--- 
 



Page 61 the limitation set forth in Section 11.4(e)(iv), and in no event shall any
such breach or failure to perform (including any delay in delivering or
failure to deliver any information required to be delivered hereunder), or any
facts, circumstances or Losses arising out of or resulting therefrom, be or be
deemed to be a condition to Closing or to the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby (and any such breach or failure to perform,
and any facts, circumstances or Losses arising out of or resulting therefrom,
shall be disregarded for the purposes of determining whether the conditions
set forth in Section 8.1 have been satisfied), nor shall Purchaser be
entitled to terminate this Agreement or otherwise fail to consummate, rescind,
or seek to enjoin, delay or otherwise prohibit, the transactions contemplated
hereby as a result of any such breach, failure to perform, facts,
circumstances or Losses. 
---|--- 



   (j) | Without prejudice to Section 6.13(i), in the event of a breach by
Seller Parent of its obligation to timely deliver Audit Financial Statements
pursuant to Section 6.13, the Losses recoverable by the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Article 11 (subject to any applicable limitations therein,
if any) shall include Purchasers increased financing costs; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to
recover any Losses that would not have been incurred to the extent that
Purchaser, acting in a commercially reasonable manner, could have obtained
less costly or equally costly financing. In the event that any such breach by
Seller Parent would reasonably be expected to result in increased financing
costs, Purchaser shall take reasonable steps to seek and consider in good
faith alternative financing that would reasonably be expected to reduce the
amount of Losses recoverable by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under
Article 11 (it being understood that nothing in this Section 6.13(j) shall
obligate Purchaser or its Affiliates to incur such financing in an effort
solely to reduce or mitigate such Losses).  
---|--- 



   (k) | In the event that Seller Parent is prevented or delayed in the
performance of its obligations under this Section 6.13 due to a Force Majeure
Event, Seller Parent shall give prompt written notice to the Purchaser of the
commencement, expected duration and termination of such Force Majeure Event.
During the continuation of a Force Majeure Event, Seller Parents
nonperformance under this Section 6.13 shall be excused and the time for
performance extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to
such Force Majeure Event, and Seller Parent shall have no liability hereunder
(including under Article 11) in respect of such period of delay or failure to
perform.

   7. | EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS MATTERS. 
---|--- 



   7.1 | _Scope of Article_. 
---|--- 

This Article 7 contains covenants and agreements of the parties as of and from
the Closing Date with respect to:

 



Page 62 Transferred Entities, whether hourly or salaried, and regardless of whether
they are actively at work or absent on the Closing Date (including,
without limitation, due to vacation, holiday, authorized leave of absence,
illness, injury or short-term disability) (the " _Transferred Entity
Employees_ "); 
---|--- 
 



   (b) | the status of employment of (i) the employees employed in the
Business by Sellers or their Affiliates other than the Transferred Entities
(the " _Asset Sale Business Entities_ "), whether hourly or salaried and
regardless of whether they are actively at work or absent on the Closing Date
(including, without limitation, due to vacation, holiday, authorized leave of
absence, illness, injury or short-term disability), and (ii) former employees
who claim re-instatement into their former employment with the Business (but
only to the extent that such claim is confirmed by a final binding,
unappealable and irrevocable ruling of a court of competent jurisdiction)
(collectively, (i) and (ii) herein are defined as the " _Transferred
Employees_ " and together with the Transferred Entity Employees, as the "
_Employees_ "); and 
---|--- 
 



   (c) | the Benefit Plans provided for or covering the Employees and (i)
former employees of Sellers or their Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Entities) who terminated employment with Sellers or such Affiliates
while employed in the Business or retired from the Business prior to the
Closing Date and (ii) all former employees of the Transferred Entities
(collectively, the " _Former Employees_ "). 
---|--- 
 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Transferred Employees and Former Employees shall not include any employees
or former employees of Sellers and their Affiliates employed in connection
with the operation of the Excluded Businesses or the Business at the Excluded
Assets set forth on _Schedule 7.1_.

 



   7.2 | _Employment and Other Employee Matters_. 
---|--- 



   (a) | The following provisions shall apply with respect to the
Transferred Employees: 
---|--- 



     | (i) |

Wherever legally permissible, as of the Closing Date, the Transferred
Employees shall become employees of Purchaser (or one of its
designated Affiliates) by operation of the applicable Laws or regulations of
the jurisdiction in which each such Transferred Employees employment is
located (the " _National Laws_ ," which term shall include the EU Acquired
Rights Directive, where applicable) and/or pursuant to the terms of any
necessary transfer agreement or procedure relating to that jurisdiction, and
the Assumed Liabilities shall include any and all Liabilities, including
pension Liabilities, relating to such Transferred Employees. Purchaser shall
assume the employment of all such Transferred Employees and agrees that the
Contracts of employment and any contractual rights of Transferred Employees
who become employees of Purchaser (or one of its  

---|---|--- 
 



Page 63 National Law shall continue unchanged following the Closing Date, with credit
for all years of service by such Employees with Sellers, and their Affiliates
where applicable, and with positions, duties, responsibilities, compensation
(but not including payment or other compensation in respect or in lieu of any
unvested portion under any restricted stock or stock option plan, except
to the extent required by applicable National Law), employee benefits
including retirement benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment,
including those arising from Sellers internal policies and/or collective
labor agreements, which are in the aggregate not less favorable than those in
effect with the applicable Asset Sale Business Entity immediately before the
Closing Date and that shall remain in effect for the longer of (x) the period
required by applicable National Law or (y) twelve (12) months, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing Purchaser shall be entitled
(subject to Sections 7.2(e)(iii)(B) and (C)) to terminate Transferred
Employees for cause, and to give notice of any future termination or
modification of employment to such Transferred Employees that would take
effect following expiry of such twelve (12) month period (or longer period
under National Law), in each case in accordance with the terms of
such Transferred Employees employment. 
---|--- 



     | (ii) |

With respect to the employment relationship of any Transferred Employees whose
employment does not transfer at the Closing by operation of National Laws
(e.g., because the applicable local law does not provide for such transfer),
Seller Parent, the applicable Asset Sale Business Entity, and Purchaser shall
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the agreement of such
Transferred Employees to transfer their employment relationship to Purchaser
(or one of its designated Affiliates) effective as of the Closing Date and
Purchaser (or one of its designated Affiliates) shall assume any and all
Liabilities, including pension Liabilities, relating to such Transferred
Employees as Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
Purchaser shall not have any obligation to make payments to any such Employee
if not required by the applicable National Laws or to modify the contractual
terms of employment of any such Employee, in each case in order to obtain such
agreement. Purchaser agrees that the Contracts of employment and any
contractual rights of such Transferred Employees shall have effect from
the Closing Date as if originally made between Purchaser (or its designated
Affiliate) and the Transferred Employees, and Purchaser shall make (or cause
its designated Affiliate to make) offers of employment consistent with the
foregoing, with credit for all years of service by such Transferred Employees
with Sellers and their Affiliates where applicable, and positions, duties,
responsibilities, compensation (but not including payment or other
compensation in respect or in lieu of any unvested portion under any
restricted stock or stock option plan), 

---|---|--- 
 



Page 64 terms and conditions of employment, including those arising from collective
labor agreements, which are, in the aggregate, not less favorable than those
in effect with the applicable Asset Sale Business Entity immediately before
the Closing Date and which shall remain in effect for twelve (12) months,
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing Purchaser shall
be entitled (subject to Sections 7.2(e)(iii)(B) and (C)) to terminate
Transferred Employees for cause, and to give notice of any future termination
or modification of employment to such Transferred Employees that would take
effect following expiry of such twelve (12) month period, in each case in
accordance with the terms of such Transferred Employees employment. 
---|--- 



     | (iii) | The Purchaser shall assume all Liabilities (including
employment relationship and pension Liabilities under Benefit Plans, but
excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Liabilities relating to Asbestos
Claims) relating to Former Employees of the Asset Sale Business Entities,
except that Purchaser shall not assume any such Liabilities relating to Former
Employees employed in France at the time of termination of their employment
with Sellers or their Affiliates.  
---|---|--- 



     | (iv) | Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate on fulfilling any
requirements of any applicable National Laws and take all other necessary or
advisable actions with respect to information and transfer procedures.  
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | Wherever legally permissible, and subject to all applicable
information, consultation and consent requirements, from the date hereof until
the Closing, Seller Parent and Purchaser shall cooperate in good faith
to identify no more than fifteen (15) Employees employed in jurisdictions
other than those described in Section 1.1 hereof whose continued employment
with Seller Parent or Sellers would be mutually beneficial to the parties, and
Seller Parent and Sellers shall seek in good faith to employ such jointly
identified Employees in other comparable positions before the Closing Date. If
Seller Parent and Sellers are unable to employ such Employees in other
positions or such Employees refuse to accept new positions with Seller Parent
or Sellers, such Employees shall qualify as Transferred Employees in
accordance with the applicable provision of this Article 7 and, if applicable,
Purchaser shall reimburse any severance and other termination costs (if any)
payable by Seller Parent or its Affiliates with respect to any such Employees. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Wherever legally permissible and subject to the individual
consent of the contractors (where required), the Contracts for the contractors
of the Asset Sale Business Entities that constitute Transferred Assets shall
be transferred to Purchaser (or one of its designated Affiliates) or a
Transferred Entity at or prior to the Closing. 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 65 complied with its obligations in respect of the compensation offered to
Employees pursuant to Sections 7.2(a)(i) and 7.2(a)(ii), Purchaser shall not
be liable for any severance or other costs (including retention payments)
related to any Employee who refuses to continue their employment with the
relevant Transferred Entity or to transfer their employment to Purchaser (or
one of its designated Affiliates) as of Closing, other than any Employee
described in Section 7.2(a)(v) hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
Employee rejects transfer to Purchaser (or one of its designated Affiliates)
at or prior to Closing and collects any such severance or other payment from
Seller Parent or its Affiliates, then Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, employ such Employee for a period of twelve (12) months
following the date of such rejection or termination absent reimbursement to
Seller Parent or such Affiliate of the applicable severance or other payment. 
---|---|--- 



   (b) | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller Parent,
Sellers and Purchaser agree that Purchaser shall promptly reimburse Seller
Parent or the applicable Seller for fifty percent (50%) of all severance and
other costs, payments and expenses incurred by Seller Parent and its
Affiliates in connection with any Employee employed in France who refuses to
continue their employment with the relevant Transferred Entity or to transfer
their employment to Purchaser (or one of its designated Affiliates) as of
Closing. 
---|--- 



   (c) | Seller Parent, Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge that the
employment relationships of the Transferred Entity Employees (and all
Liabilities relating thereto as well as any Liabilities relating to the Former
Employees of the Transferred Entities) will remain with the Transferred
Entities as Assumed Liabilities hereunder and shall not be affected by the
Closing and that the Contracts of employment of all Transferred Entity
Employees as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date shall transfer
with the Transferred Entities. 
---|--- 



   (d) |

Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
agreement of the Employees listed in _Schedule 7.2(d)_ (the " _Key Employees_
") to transfer their employment to Purchaser (or one of its designated
Affiliates) or continue their employment with the relevant Transferred Entity,
as applicable, after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers
shall not have any obligation to make payments or offer other benefits to such
Employees or modify the terms of employment in order to obtain such agreement.
If any Key Employee rejects transfer from Sellers to Purchaser (or one of
its designated Affiliates) at Closing or terminates his/her employment, in
accordance with the termination procedures set forth in the applicable
National Laws, with the relevant Transferred Entity on or prior to the Closing
Date, then (i) Sellers, to the extent permitted by Law and not in conflict
with existing obligations under any relevant Contract, shall terminate his or
her employment (in respect of Employees described above who have not
previously terminated such employment with Sellers) and shall not 

---|--- 
 



Page 66 following the date of such rejection or termination; and (ii) Sellers shall
cooperate with Purchaser to find a reasonable interim solution for the loss
of such Employee. For clarity, Purchaser shall not be liable for any severance
or other costs (including retention payments) related to any Key Employee who
(i) refuses to continue their employment with the relevant Transferred Entity
or (ii) to transfer their employment to Purchaser (or one of its designated
Affiliates) so long as Purchaser is in compliance with its obligations in
respect of compensation pursuant to Sections 7.2(a)(i) and 7.2(a)(ii), as
applicable. 
---|--- 



   (e) | The following provisions shall apply with respect to all
Employees and Former Employees:

     | (i) | Purchaser agrees that in computing the amount of entitlement
under all terms and conditions of employment, including compensation and
employee benefits, service with Sellers, the Transferred Entities or any of
their respective Affiliates, and with Purchaser and its Affiliates shall be
taken into account. Seller Parent and Sellers agree that they shall be solely
responsible for all Liabilities arising from or related to ongoing obligations
of Seller Parent or any Seller under Sellers Benefit Plans other than
Liabilities under the Benefit Plans that will be continued by the Transferred
Entities after the Closing (including the German Retirement Plans) and the
Liabilities that will otherwise be assumed by Purchaser (or its designated
Affiliates) pursuant to this Section 7.2 (collectively, the " _Assumed Benefit
Plans_ "). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall
not assume any Liability with respect to any vested rights (as determined
under the rules of the applicable plan) under any equity-based incentive
compensation scheme of the Transferred Entities, Sellers or their Affiliates
in effect prior to Closing. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser accepts that it or
the Transferred Entities, as the case may be, shall be responsible (as Assumed
Liabilities) for, and shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties for
Losses and Liabilities relating to, dismissal of Employees by Purchaser, the
Transferred Entities or another one of Purchasers Affiliates, as the case may
be, at any time on or following the Closing, notwithstanding that such amounts
may be calculated by reference to periods of employment with Sellers and/or
Transferred Entities and/or their Affiliates prior to the Closing as well as
periods of employment with Purchaser and/or its Subsidiaries and their
Affiliates on or following the Closing.  
---|---|--- 



     | (iii) | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
following shall be Assumed Liabilities of Purchaser, subject to
indemnification of the Seller Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 11.2:

Page 67 employment of (x) Employees and (y) Former Employees (including, without
limitation, for any Taxes or social security contributions) other than Former
Employees employed in France as of the date of termination of their
employment with Seller Parent or its Affiliates;

     | (B) | any claim relating to or arising out of a change in the
working conditions and/or terms and conditions of employment of the Employees
(including under Contracts and collective agreements) initiated by Purchaser
(or its designated Affiliates) and occurring on or after the Closing Date,
and any Losses or Liabilities relating to or arising out of any such change
(including any Loss or Liability arising out of the termination or replacement
of any incentive compensation scheme (whether equity or cash based), other
than vested portions thereof); 
---|---|--- 



     | (C) | any claim (including any pending, ongoing or threatened
litigation, whether known or unknown) relating to or arising out of an
Employees or Former Employees (other than Former Employees employed in
France as of the date of termination of their employment with Seller Parent
or its Affiliates) employment or termination of employment (including with
respect to any termination simultaneous with Closing, other than by Purchaser
and its Affiliates), whether in Contract or in tort or under statute or other
Law, for any remedy (including, without limitation, for breach of Contract,
unfair dismissal, any form of severance, redundancy, indemnity or termination
payment, equal pay, sex, race or disability discrimination, pain and
suffering, damages, unlawful deductions from wages or for breach of statutory
duty or of any other nature), and any Losses or Liabilities relating to or
arising out of any such claim (including any Loss or Liability of the Seller
Indemnified Parties in the event Purchaser is unable to administer or manage
any such Liability without the involvement of the Seller Indemnified Parties
due to applicable Law or a ruling from a court of competent jurisdiction);
and  
---|---|--- 



     | (D) | any claim, Loss, or Liability under, that relates to or
arises out of the Assumed Benefit Plans or any assets or Liabilities
transferred to Purchaser pursuant to Section 7.2(e). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | Where a continuance of membership of Employees and Former
Employees in any Assumed Benefit Plan is legally required or requested by
Sellers and permissible pursuant to the relevant plan rules, Purchaser shall
use reasonable efforts to ensure that such membership is continued following
the Closing Date (including, if applicable, by the relevant Transferred Entity
or designated Affiliate). Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, as of
the Closing Date, if legally permissible and possible in the relevant
jurisdiction, each Employee shall cease to be an active participant in
Sellers Benefit Plans and Purchaser shall ensure that the Assumed Benefit
Plans are continued in accordance with the provisions of this Article 7.

Page 68 maintain employee benefit plans, programs or arrangements outside of the
United States in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and applicable
National Laws. To the extent legally permissible and possible in the relevant
jurisdictions, (x) the Assumed Benefit Plans will be transferred or assigned
to Purchaser, its designated Affiliate or a Transferred Entity as of the
Closing Date and Purchaser, its designated Affiliate or the Transferred
Entity, as the case may be, shall be solely liable for any claims relating to
benefits under the Assumed Benefit Plans, and (y) Sellers shall be solely
liable for any claims relating to benefits under the Benefit Plans other than
the Assumed Benefit Plans. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | To the extent administratively and legally possible,
Sellers will use their commercially reasonable efforts to secure that the
administrators or responsible persons under Sellers funded Assumed Benefit
Plans will (x) pay or transfer, or cause to be paid or transferred, the
assets of Sellers Assumed Benefit Plans to Purchasers (or its designated
Affiliates) benefit plans in respect of Transferred Employees or (y) assign
any insurance contract to Purchasers benefit plans in respect of Transferred
Employees. Any such payment or assignment will be made as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date. Purchaser will accept the assignment of any plan
assets and insurance contract and will use its reasonable best efforts to
secure that the administrators or other responsible persons of Purchasers
benefit plans will accept the payment or transfer. Where the Assumed Benefit
Plans include assets in respect of employees or former employees whose
Liability will otherwise remain with Sellers, the basis for fixing those
assets which will be transferred to Purchaser will be mutually agreed to by
Seller Parent and Purchaser. Where an Assumed Benefit Plan is unfunded, there
will consequently be no transfer of assets. The provisions set out in this
paragraph shall not in any way limit Purchasers right to make future changes
within the scope of applicable laws to any benefit plans.  
---|---|--- 



   (f) | To the extent permitted by Law, Purchaser shall give to Sellers,
and Seller Parent shall give and cause to be given to Purchaser, on a timely
basis all requisite and pertinent information which Sellers and
Purchaser, respectively, may reasonably require in order to comply with their
respective obligations with respect to the Employees and/or the Former
Employees. Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate with each other with respect
to any employment-related charge, complaint, investigation or inquiry of any
kind relating to any Employee and/or Former Employee, including but not
limited to, providing copies of documents and making witnesses available.

Agreement such that any condition in Section 8.2(b) would not be satisfied and

---|--- 



   (a) | If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1, this

exclusive remedy, and the receipt of the Termination Fee by Seller Parent

---|--- 



   (c) | Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from acquiring any

preceding four (4) full calendar quarters) and (ii) if Competitive Activities
constitute in excess of fifteen percent (15%) of the revenues of the Person
or business acquired during such time, Seller Parent shall, or shall cause

invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Section
10.1, but this Section 10.1 shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. It is the intention
of the parties that if any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein
is held to cover a geographic area or to be for a length of time that is not
permitted by applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any
extent invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of
no effect, but to the extent such provision would be valid or enforceable
under applicable Law, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and

Page 76 Agreement, in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and
payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such Tax which relates to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending prior to the Closing Date shall
(i) in the case of any real and personal property Taxes, be deemed to be the
amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period up to but not
including the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days
in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any other Tax, be
deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Straddle
Period ended prior to the Closing Date. Any prepayments and deposits of Taxes
by Sellers or a Transferred Entity relating to a Straddle Period shall be
taken into account as though the relevant Straddle Period ended prior to the
Closing Date, and any Tax credits for a Straddle Period shall be allocated
between the pre-Closing and post-Closing portions of the Straddle Period in
the same manner as the Tax to which they relate would be allocated. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner consistent with prior practice of the Transferred Entities
and the Sellers. 
---|--- 
 



   (e) | _Group Tax Returns_. Where a Transferred Entity is a member of a
consolidated, combined, unitary or affiliated group or in a fiscal unity with

or permitted by applicable law, use any of their losses, credits or other
tax attributes to reduce the Tax liability of the Transferred Entity for
taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending before the Closing Date and (ii)
may, if required or permitted by applicable law, use any losses, credits or
other tax attributes of the Transferred Entity arising in a taxable period
(or portion thereof) ending before the Closing Date to reduce their own Tax
liability and shall not be required to compensate the Transferred Entity or
Purchaser for any such losses, credits or other tax attributes.

   (f) |

_Refunds_. If Purchaser or any Transferred Entity receives a refund (or a
credit against non-Retained Taxes in lieu of a refund) of Retained Taxes
(excluding any refund or credit attributable to any loss in a tax year (or
portion of a Straddle Period) beginning on or after the Closing Date applied
(e.g., as a carryback) against income in a Tax year (or portion of a Straddle
Period) ending before the Closing Date), Purchaser will pay to the applicable
Seller within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such refund (or the
application of such credit), an amount equal to such refund (or credit),
except to the extent any such refund (or credit) has been taken into account
in the calculation of Final Closing Date Net Working

Page 77 preceding sentence shall apply to any VAT paid by a Transferred Entity on
purchases made by the Transferred Entity ("Input VAT") for any tax period (or
portion thereof) ending before the Closing Date for which the Transferred
Entity receives a refund, or a credit against VAT otherwise payable by the
Transferred Entity to a Taxing Authority on sales made by the Transferred
Entity ("Output VAT") for any tax period (or portion thereof) beginning on or
after the Closing Date, and for this purpose Input VAT of the Transferred
Entity shall be credited against Output VAT payable by the Transferred Entity
on a "first in  first out" basis, unless otherwise provided by law. If the
Sellers receive a refund (or a credit against Retained Taxes in lieu of a
refund) of non-Retained Taxes, Seller Parent will pay, or cause to be paid, to
Purchaser, within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such refund (or
the application of such credit), the amount of such refund (or credit).

   (g) | _Settlement of Deficiencies and Adjustments_. If any
Governmental Authority issues to any Purchaser or Transferred Entity a notice
of deficiency or any other type of proposed adjustment of Taxes of the
Transferred Entity that could give rise solely to Retained Taxes, Purchaser
must notify Seller Parent within thirty (30) Business Days of receipt of the
notice of deficiency or other proposed adjustment. Seller Parent and the
applicable Seller shall, at their own expense, have the sole and exclusive
right to contest any assessment or other proposed adjustment of Taxes of the
Transferred Entity that could give rise solely to Retained Taxes. Sellers have
full right to control the conduct of any audit or administrative or judicial
proceeding (a " _Tax Proceeding_ ") that could give rise solely to Retained
Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser and its representatives shall
have the right, at Purchasers expense, to participate in any such Tax
Proceeding; provided, further, that settlement or other resolution of such Tax
Proceeding shall be subject to the consent of Purchaser (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld). Seller Parent shall keep Purchaser fully and
timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any Tax
Proceeding controlled by it and Seller Parent shall in good faith allow
Purchaser to make comments to Seller Parent regarding the conduct of
or positions taken in any such Tax Proceeding. Purchaser, at its own expense,
has the sole and exclusive right to contest any assessment or other proposed
adjustment of Taxes of a Transferred Entity that could give rise to non-
Retained Taxes, and shall control the conduct of any Tax Proceeding that
could give rise to non-Retained Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ that, if any
such Tax Proceeding could give rise to Retained Taxes as well as non-Retained
Taxes, then (i) Seller Parent and its representatives shall have the right,
at Seller Parents expense, to participate in any such Tax Proceeding, (ii)
settlement or other resolution of any such Tax Proceeding shall be subject to
the consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
and (iii) Purchaser shall keep Seller Parent fully and timely informed with
respect to the commencement, status and nature of any such Tax Proceeding and
Purchaser shall in good faith allow Seller Parent to make comments to
Purchaser regarding the conduct of or positions taken in any such Tax

Page 78 Purchaser shall provide, or cause to be provided to, each other with such
cooperation and information as either of them reasonably may request of
the other in filing any Tax Return, an amended return or claim for refund,
determining a liability for Taxes, including any VAT liability in connection
with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, or a right to refund of
Taxes or in conducting any audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes.
Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all
relevant Tax Returns, together with accompanying schedules and related
workpapers, documents relating to rulings or other determinations by taxing
authorities and records concerning the ownership and tax basis of property,
which either party may possess. Each party shall make its employees available
on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanation of any documents or
information provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall
be required to prepare any documents (except tax data packages referred to
below), or determine any information not then in its possession, in response
to a request under this Section 10.3(h). Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the party requesting assistance hereunder shall reimburse the other
for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in providing any return,
document or other written information, and shall compensate the other for any
reasonable costs (excluding wages and salaries) of making employees available,
upon receipt of reasonable documentation of such costs. Each party will
retain and maintain all returns, schedules and workpapers and all material
records, computer software and data maintained thereunder, or other documents
relating thereto, until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(including extensions) of the taxable years to which such returns and other
documents relate and, unless such returns and other documents are offered to
the other party, until the final determination of any payments which may be
required in respect of such years under this Agreement and to give the other
party reasonable notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records or computer software and data maintained thereunder,
and, if the other party so requests, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records or computer software and data maintained
thereunder. Any information obtained under this Section 10.3(h) shall be kept
confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of returns or claims for refund or in conducting any audit or other
proceeding. Purchaser and the Transferred Entities shall, at their own cost
and expense, fully and accurately complete and submit any tax data packages
required by Sellers within the time periods established by the tax department
of Seller Parent consistent with past practices. Purchaser and Seller Parent
further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or
any other person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).

thereunder, and the provisions of this Agreement shall govern the rights and
obligations of Sellers, Purchaser and the Transferred Entities to make or
receive payments with respect to Taxes or refunds of Taxes of the Transferred

   (j) |

_German Tax Group Transferred Entities_. Sellers have by mutual termination
agreement or termination for good cause terminated the domination and profit
transfer agreements ( _Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrage_) to which
the German Tax Group Transferred Entities are parties effective as at the
close of December 31, 2013, provided that the domination and profit transfer
agreement ( _Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrag_) between Honeywell
Deutschland GmbH and Honeywell Friction Materials International GmbH dated
November 22, 2012, shall be so terminated at or prior to Closing
and effective as at the Closing Date. Sellers shall execute, or cause to be
executed, any documents that may be required under the applicable law for due
termination, including the deregistration of the domination and profit
transfer agreements in the German commercial register ( _Handelsregister_ ).
Sellers and Purchaser agree that (i) the domination and profit transfer
agreements have been duly performed until and including December 31, 2013,
provided that the domination and profit transfer agreement ( _Beherrschungs-
und Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrag_) between Honeywell Deutschland GmbH and
Honeywell Friction Materials International GmbH dated November 22, 2012, will
be duly performed until the Closing Date and (ii) Sellers shall be entitled
to any profits and obliged to cover any losses of the German Tax Group
Transferred Entities until such relevant date. The parties further agree that
(i) the profits or losses of each German Tax Group Transferred Entity until
and including December 31, 2013 shall be based on the annual statutory
accounts for the business year 2013 of such German Tax Group Transferred
Entity, and in addition that the profits or losses of Honeywell
Friction Materials International GmbH under the domination and profit
transfer agreement ( _Beherrschungs- und Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrag_) with
Honeywell Deutschland GmbH dated November 22, 2012, until the Closing Date
shall be determined based on an interim pro-forma income statement and
balance sheet as of such date to be drawn up by Honeywell Friction Materials
International GmbH pursuant to applicable German GAAP as soon as practicable
after the Closing Date and to be agreed by Sellers and Purchaser, (ii) if
Sellers and Purchaser do not agree on such income statement and pro-forma
balance sheet within six (6) months of the Closing Date,

Page 80 accounting firm whose resolution of the dispute shall, absent fraud or
manifest error, be final and binding on the parties and the fees of whom
shall be paid 50% by each party, (iii) the amount of profits or losses of such
German Tax Group Transferred Entity determined according to (i) or (ii) above,
plus interest required by law, shall be paid in the case of profits by such
German Tax Group Transferred Entity to Honeywell Deutschland GmbH, and in the
case of losses by Honeywell Deutschland GmbH to such German Tax Group
Transferred Entity, in both cases to be paid within 30 days after the
statutory accounts of such German Tax Group Transferred Entity for 2013 (or
in the case of Honeywell Friction Materials International GmbHs profits or
losses for the period January 1, 2014 until the Closing Date, Honeywell
Friction Materials International GmbHs statutory accounts for its year that
includes the Closing Date) have been approved by the German Tax Group
Transferred Entitys shareholder(s), and (iv) if any such payment is made
after the Closing Date, then immediately upon receipt of any such payment (A)
from such German Tax Group Transferred Entity to Honeywell Deutschland GmbH,
Honeywell Deutschland GmbH shall pay the Purchaser an amount equal to the
amount Honeywell Deutschland GmbH received from such German Tax Group
Transferred Entity or (B) from Honeywell Deutschland GmbH to such German Tax
Group Transferred Entity, the Purchaser shall pay Honeywell Deutschland GmbH
an amount equal to the amount Honeywell Deutschland GmbH paid to such German
Tax Group Transferred Entity, which payment in either case shall be treated as
an adjustment of the purchase price paid by the Purchaser to Honeywell
Deutschland GmbH for the Equity Interest in such German Tax Group Transferred
Entity (or in the case of Honeywell Aftermarket Europe GmbH, the Equity
Interest in Honeywell Bremsbelag GmbH). In the case of any payment to be made
after the Closing Date pursuant to clause (iii) of the immediately preceding
sentence, Purchaser will use reasonable best efforts to ensure (i) that the
amount of the payment (excluding interest) shall be properly reflected in
accordance with German GAAP and applicable law in the statutory accounts of
the German Tax Group Transferred Entity with respect to which such payment
will be made for the year that includes the period for which such payment will
be made and (ii) such statutory accounts shall be approved by the
shareholder(s) of such German Tax Group Transferred Entity. For the avoidance
of doubt, any payment to be made after the Closing Date, or the obligation to
make any such payment, under this Section 10.3(j) shall not be taken into
account for purposes of the Post-Closing Adjustments in Section 2.2. Seller
Parent shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify Purchaser for all such
Taxes that result from, the termination of the domination and profit transfer
agreement and the exit of German Tax Group Transferred Entities from the
German fiscal unity including, but not limited to, Taxes to be paid or
withheld due to the compliance with the obligations resulting from the fiscal
unity. Any payments to be made (if any) in relation to the domination and
profit transfer agreements including but not limited to its consummation or
termination are to be understood as net of German withholding taxes required
by law to be withheld (i.e. after deduction of any such German withholding
taxes).

Page 81 right, without the consent of Seller or Seller Parent, to make an election
under Code Section 338(g) with respect to any one or more of the Transferred
Entities. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller Parent for any
increased Tax liability of Seller Parent as a result of any such election made
by Purchaser under Code Section 338(g). 
---|--- 
 



   (l) | _Tax Indemnification_. Seller Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless Purchaser and the Transferred Entities for any Retained Taxes;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Seller Parents obligations to indemnify
Purchaser and the Transferred Entities pursuant to this Section 10.2(l) shall
not apply to any Retained Taxes to the extent the Liability for such Taxes was
taken into account in the calculation of the Final Closing Date Net
Working Capital. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller Parents obligations to
indemnify Purchaser and the Transferred Entities pursuant to this Section
10.2(l) shall not be subject to any limitation under Article 11. 
---|--- 
 



   (m) | _Restriction on Post-Closing Dividends_. If a Transferred Entity
pays a dividend to Purchaser (or engages in a transaction that is treated as a
dividend for US income tax purposes) on or after the Closing Date and on or
before December 31, 2014, and if Purchaser does not make an election under
Code Section 338(g) with respect to the Transferred Entity, then Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller Parent for any increased Tax
liability of Seller Parent as a result of any such actual or deemed dividend. 
---|--- 



   10.4 | _Further Assurances_. 
---|--- 

From time to time after the Closing, without further consideration, the
parties shall cooperate with each other and shall execute and deliver
instruments of transfer or assignment or assumption, or such other documents,
to the other party as such other party reasonably may request to evidence or
perfect Purchasers right, title and interest to the Transferred Assets or to
more effectively relieve Sellers of any liabilities or obligations to be
assumed by Purchaser hereunder, and otherwise carry out the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, taking
such actions as may be required to finalize the transfer of any Transferred
Assets set forth on Schedule 1.1(b)(ii) and Schedule 1.1(c)(ii) to Honeywell
Chongqing and Honeywell Romania, respectively, to the extent not transferred
as of Closing).



   10.5 | _Reports; Access to Books and Records_. 
---|--- 

After the Closing, Purchaser shall permit Sellers to have reasonable access
to and the right to make copies of Purchasers or the Transferred Entities or
their Affiliates books, records and files to the extent reasonably necessary
for use in litigation, financial reporting, tax return preparation, or tax
compliance or other compliance (including

 



Page 82  compliance with the stock exchange rules and regulations) matters. In
addition, Purchaser shall make available to Sellers, upon Sellers reasonable
request, personnel of Purchaser, the Transferred Entities or their Affiliates
who are familiar with any such matter requested. Purchaser agrees to preserve
and keep all of the books, records and files of the Business included in the
Transferred Assets for a period of not less than five (5) years after the
Closing Date, or for any longer period as may be required (i) by any
Governmental Authority, (ii) by any Law or (iii) in connection with any
ongoing litigation, suit or proceeding. Prior to disposing of any such
information, Purchaser shall afford Sellers a reasonable opportunity, at
Sellers cost and expense, to segregate, remove or copy such books, records
and files as Sellers may select to the extent reasonably necessary for
such purposes. Purchaser shall also make available to Sellers, at Sellers
cost and expense and to the extent related to an Excluded Liability, copies of
(x) process, material, test, manufacturing and quality specifications, and (y)
sales information reflecting volume, customers, yearly totals and similar
information.



   10.6 | _Cooperation in Litigation_. 
---|--- 

Purchaser and Seller Parent shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the
prosecution or defense of any claim, litigation or other proceeding arising
from their respective conduct of the Business acquired by Purchaser pursuant
to this Agreement and involving one or more third parties. Purchaser and
Seller Parent shall cooperate in (i) maintaining all records used in and
relevant to claims referred to in Sections 1.6 to 1.8 and (ii) designating
custodian(s) of record for such purposes. The party requesting such
cooperation shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
providing such cooperation (including reasonable legal fees and disbursements)
by the party providing such cooperation and by its officers, directors,
employees and agents, but shall not be responsible for reimbursing such party
or its officers, directors, employees and agents for their time spent in such
cooperation. Purchaser agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, encourage any third party to commence any lawsuit in
respect of, or otherwise pursue, claims referred to in Sections 1.6 to 1.8.



   10.7 | _Names and Marks_.

   (a) |

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it does not by virtue of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise, obtain any
rights to Sellers Marks, all of which are, and will remain, the sole

Entities). Purchaser further acknowledges and agrees that Seller Parent and
its Affiliates retain exclusively all rights to any names, marks, trade names
or trademarks not used exclusively in the Business and any of the foregoing
that are not Transferred Intellectual Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days from the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall have the limited right (i) to use up Business Inventory, stationery and
other printed material acquired pursuant to this Agreement without modifying
any trademark or logo thereon, provided that all such material carrying any
of the Sellers Marks shall clearly indicate by stamp, sticker or other
similar notice or marking that the Transferred Assets are now 

---|--- 
 



Page 83  owned by Purchaser, and (ii) to use Business Personal Property acquired
pursuant to this Agreement without modifying any trademark or logo thereon,
provided that, in the case of tooling, Purchaser marks any product
manufactured with such tooling to indicate the date of manufacture and shall
eliminate such trademark or logo from such tooling prior to abandoning or
disposing thereof.

 



   (b) | Without prejudice to Section 10.7(a), Purchaser shall promptly
and, in any event (if not in violation of applicable Law or otherwise
prohibited by a Governmental Authority) shall within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, change the name of each Transferred Entity with the
relevant Governmental Authority in such Transferred Entitys jurisdiction of
formation to remove any of Sellers Marks from the name of such entity.

Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



   10.12 | _Deed Restriction_. 
---|--- 

Promptly after the Closing, Purchaser and/or its Affiliates, at Purchasers
or such Affiliates sole cost and expense, agree (to the extent allowed under
applicable Laws and/or customary practice) to record with the recorders
office or other appropriate office having jurisdiction over the real property
set forth on  _Schedule 10.12_ (the " _Restricted Property_ ") the Land Use
Restriction in form and substance as set forth on _Attachment D_ hereto with
respect to the Restricted Property, which Land Use Restriction shall run with
the land and bind Purchaser and all future owners of the Restricted Property.
Purchaser shall furnish evidence to Seller Parent of such recordation promptly

Agreements);

Purchaser in Articles 3 and 4, respectively, and any related indemnity
obligations hereunder which arise in respect of a breach of such

months after the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) the

Representations or a breach of the representations and warranties in Section
3.19

     | (i) | within the scope of Section 11.1(b), collectively exceed an
amount equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the Purchase Price (the " _General

"Aggregate Cap" and, together with the General Cap and the Environmental Cap,
the " _Seller Liability Caps_ "), other than claims within the scope of

prejudice, for the avoidance of doubt, to the recoverability of any such

arises out of or is exacerbated by (A) facts or circumstances relating solely
to the identity of Purchaser or its Affiliates; (B) any action or omission 

---|--- 
 



Page 87  carried out at the express written request of, or with the written consent

any Laws after Closing which results in or has the effect of imposing more
onerous requirements than those in effect at Closing.



   (f) | For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses in connection
with a claim for indemnification under Section 11.1 or Section 11.2 (but, for
the avoidance of doubt, not for purposes of determining whether a breach has
occurred), each of the representations and warranties that contains any
qualifications as to "materiality", "Material Adverse Effect" or similar shall
be deemed to have been given as though there were no such qualifications, and
any such qualifications shall be disregarded for such purpose. 
---|--- 



   (g) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event
shall any Indemnitor be liable to any Indemnitee hereunder for any Losses that
constitute consequential, indirect, special, exemplary or punitive damages
or Losses that constitute damages or Losses for lost business, income or
profits, loss of business reputation or opportunity or diminution of value,
except in each case, to the extent such damages are payable to a third party
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any holder of shares or other equity

pursuant to a final, non-appealable judgment or order in connection with the
final determination or settlement of a Third Party Claim. 
---|--- 



   (h) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event
shall Seller Parent be liable to any Purchaser Indemnified Party for any
Losses (or portion thereof) that constitute royalty or similar payments
arising out of a TMD Claim (including any settlement thereof) or, for the
avoidance of doubt, to the extent such Losses (or portion thereof) arise out
of or relate to the use of the technology patented in EP0654616B1 by Purchaser
or its Affiliates, except to the extent that such technology is used in the
same manner and products as it was used by the Business prior to Closing

connection with any other part, or product, of the friction material business
or any other business of Purchaser or its Affiliates). 
---|--- 



   (i) | Upon payment of any amount pursuant to any claim for
indemnification hereunder, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the extent
of such payment, to all of the Indemnitees rights of recovery against any
third party with respect to any matter to which such claim relates. 
---|--- 



   (j) | In calculating the amounts payable by Seller Parent pursuant to
Section 11.1 (and any amounts applied towards the Threshold): 
---|--- 



      | (i) |

the amount of any indemnifiable Losses shall be determined without duplication
or double counting of any Liabilities reflected in the final
Closing Statement (including the calculation of the Purchase Price) or 

---|---|--- 
 



Page 88 and recovered by a Purchaser Indemnified Party under any other representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement and shall be reduced by (i) amounts recovered
by the Purchaser Indemnified Party under indemnification agreements or
arrangements with third parties or under any insurance policy (including
workers compensation insurance) with respect to such Losses; and (ii)
recovery from third parties by the Purchaser Indemnified Party. If, subsequent
to receiving an indemnification payment hereunder, a Purchaser Indemnified
Party receives any amounts from any such third party under any such
applicable indemnity agreements, insurance policies or otherwise, then
Purchaser shall cause such Purchaser Indemnified Party to promptly reimburse
Seller Parent for any such payment made up to the amount received by such
Purchaser Indemnified Party, net of any expenses incurred by such Purchaser
Indemnified Party in collecting such amounts. Further, if the amount of Losses
determined under this subsection are reduced to reflect any amounts recovered
by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties from any such third party under any such
applicable indemnity agreements or otherwise and the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties are subsequently determined by a final and binding decision of a court
of competent jurisdiction to be required to disgorge all or any part of such
amounts, Seller Parent will be obligated to promptly make payment to the

---|--- 



     | (ii) | the amount of any indemnifiable Loss (or portion thereof)
arising out of or relating to any product recall or product warranty claim
shall be allocated to Seller Parent solely in such proportion (the "
_Product Recall Loss Allocation_ ") as is appropriate to reflect the relative
fault of Seller Parent and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, and Seller Parents liability and
obligation to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect of any
such Loss shall be limited to its Product Recall Loss Allocation of such Loss.
Determination of a Product Recall Loss Allocation will take into account,
without limitation, whether the Purchaser Indemnified Parties effected a
timely recall, failed to diligently satisfy customer requirements or otherwise
sought to prevent or mitigate the applicable Loss and such other actions or
omissions of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties which may have exacerbated or
contributed to such Loss.

use; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | consists of the costs of routine maintenance or repair or
the costs of replacement, improvement or upgrade of or to any building or
other structure; or 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) | arises out of or relates to (A) any Required Pre-Closing

Pre-Closing Soil/Groundwater Remediation or Required Pre-Closing Asbestos
Remediation, as applicable or (B) any other remedial or response action
whatsoever that is performed to standards that are higher than those which are
applicable to the industrial use of the relevant Owned Real Property or Leased

Parent shall have no liability or obligation to Purchaser Indemnified Party

Purchaser on behalf of each Purchaser Indemnified Party agrees that Seller

cost actions including (without limitation) risk-based remediation standards,
natural attenuation, institutional controls, and/or deed restrictions
provided they do not unreasonably interfere with the industrial use of the
relevant Indemnified Site or other relevant Owned Real Property or Leased Real
Property as carried out at Closing.  
---|--- 
 



Page 90 exclusive remedies of the Purchaser and/or any Purchaser Indemnified Party in
respect of any Losses relating to the exposure of any person to asbestos shall

claim subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1 or Section 11.2, or
of any obligation or facts which may reasonably be expected to give rise to
such claim for indemnification, describing the claim, the amount thereof (if
known and quantifiable), and the basis thereof (a " _Notice of Claim_ "),
provided that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the
Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent such failure
shall have prejudiced the Indemnitor. 
---|--- 



   (b) | With respect to any third party action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim or potential claim (in each case excluding any
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim or potential claim
of a shareholder or other holder of equity interests (or an Affiliate
thereof) in Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) which is the subject of a
Notice of Claim other than a TMD Claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), an
Indemnitor shall be entitled but not obliged to assume control and/or conduct
(with counsel of its choice) the defense of such Third Party Claim at the
Indemnitors expense and at its option by sending written notice of its
election to do so within fifteen (15) Business Days after receiving the
Notice of Claim from the Indemnitee as aforesaid; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that: 
---|--- 



     | (i) | The Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such
purpose (the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne
by Indemnitee); and to assert against any third party (other than the
Indemnitor or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates) any and all crossclaims
and counterclaims the Indemnitee may have, subject to Indemnitors prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | If the Indemnitor elects to assume the defense of any such
Third Party Claim the Indemnitor shall be entitled to compromise or settle
such claim in its sole discretion so long as either (x) such compromise
or settlement is purely monetary, does not impose injunctive or equitable
relief or sanction against the Indemnitee, does not include any other material
financial obligation on the part of the Indemnitee and provides an
unconditional release of the Indemnitee with respect to such claim or (y) the
Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld); and 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 91 of such Third Party Claim within the fifteen (15) Business Day period set
forth above, the Indemnitee may assume the defense of such claim with counsel
selected by it (and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor) and may make any
compromise or settlement thereof or otherwise protect against the same and be
entitled to all amounts paid as a result of such Third Party Claim or any
compromise or settlement thereof, _provided_ that, in the case of any such
compromise or settlement, (x) such compromise or settlement is purely monetary
and provides an unconditional release of the Indemnitor with respect to such
Third Party Claim, or (y) the Indemnitee shall obtain the prior written
consent of the Indemnitor (which shall not be unreasonably withheld). 
---|---|--- 



   (c) | The Indemnitee shall at all times cooperate, at its own expense,
in all reasonable ways with, make its relevant files and records available for
inspection and copying by, and make its employees available or
otherwise render reasonable assistance to, the Indemnitor. 
---|--- 



   (d) | With respect to any third party action, lawsuit, proceeding,
investigation or other claim or potential claim (in each case excluding any
action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim or potential claim
of a shareholder or other holder of equity interests (or an Affiliate
thereof) in Purchaser or any of its Affiliates) which is the subject of a
Notice of Claim and which relates to a TMD Claim, from and after the Closing,
the Purchaser shall not be entitled to assume control or conduct the defense
thereof. Seller Parent shall not, and shall cause the other Sellers not to,
settle any TMD Claim other than for monetary damages without the written
consent of Purchaser (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

the avoidance of doubt, any such claim in respect of any Excluded Assets),
the Indemnitor shall be entitled (but not obligated) at any time to assume and

records and information in a way that would not waive such privilege); and
provided, finally, that access to records or other information that are
confidential may be conditioned upon execution of customary non-disclosure
undertakings in respect of such records and information; 
---|---|--- 
 



Page 93 reasonably be requested by the Indemnitor to avoid unreasonable delay in the
performance of any Site Remediation and/or any assessment, settlement or
defense of any Third Party Claim; 
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | providing any necessary temporary, non-exclusive license or

Indemnitor, provided that such easement or access does not materially
interfere with the Business activities conducted at any facilities;

it may have against third party contributors to the underlying matter; and 
---|---|---

acceptable to Indemnitee, such access shall only occur at times and for
periods reasonably agreed to by Purchaser and such access shall not
unreasonably interfere with the Business activities conducted at any
facilities.

The Indemnitor shall be permitted (but not obligated), with the consent of
Indemnitee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or

(a) any interaction with, including, without limitation, any negotiation, of
an agreement or settlement with, Governmental Authorities; (b) any Site
Remediation; and (c) any claim, action proceeding, or investigation with
respect to Purchaser Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor
shall be obligated to reasonably consult with the Indemnitee concerning the
Indemnitors communications with any Governmental Authorities or third
parties on issues which may materially prejudice the Indemnitees interests
with respect to such matters. Furthermore, Purchaser agrees to promptly notify
Seller Parent of any notice concerning any Site Remediation or Environmental
Claim made by any party on or after the Closing Date.

or any of its Affiliates may have against Sellers and their Affiliates
