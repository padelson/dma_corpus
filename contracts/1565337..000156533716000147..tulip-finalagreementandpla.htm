ARTICLE 2 
THE OFFER

Section 2.01. Conduct of the Offer.

(a) Merger Subsidiary shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Exchange Act) the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date of this Agreement (but in no event later than twelve (12) Business Days
from the date of this Agreement); provided, however, that Merger Subsidiary
shall not be required to commence the Offer if: (i) any of the conditions set
forth in clauses (a), (b) (excluding clauses (b)(iii) and (b)(iv)), (c)(i),
(d), (e), (g), (h), (i) and (j) of Exhibit B shall not be satisfied; or (ii)
the Company shall not be prepared to file immediately with the SEC, and to
disseminate to holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the Schedule 14D-9.
(The date on which Merger Subsidiary commences the Offer, within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Offer Commencement Date").

(b) The obligation of Merger Subsidiary to accept for payment, and pay for,
shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant
to the Offer shall be subject to the satisfaction or (if permitted) waiver of:
(i) the condition (the "Minimum Condition") that there shall be validly
tendered (and not withdrawn) a number of shares of Company Common Stock
(excluding shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or
satisfaction of such guarantee) that, together with any shares of Company
Common Stock owned by Ultimate Parent, Parent or Merger Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Acceptance Time, represents no less than 66 2/3% of the Adjusted
Outstanding Share Number; and (ii) the other conditions set forth in Exhibit B
(the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth in Exhibit B are
referred to collectively as the "Offer Conditions"). For purposes of this
Agreement, the "Adjusted Outstanding Share Number" shall be the sum of: (A)
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time; plus (B) an additional number of
shares equal to the aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise, as applicable, of any
Company Compensatory Awards, and any other options, warrants or other rights
to acquire, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for, Company Common
Stock for which, as of immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, (x) a valid
election has been made or notice has been given to convert, exchange or
exercise, as applicable, such Company Compensatory Awards or such other
option, warrant or other right, as applicable, into Company Common Stock in
accordance with the terms thereof but (y) such Company Common Stock has not
yet been duly issued.

(c) Merger Subsidiary expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion,
to: (i) increase the Offer Price; and (ii) waive any Offer Condition or make
any other changes to the terms and conditions of the Offer;

 provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the Company: (A)
the Minimum Condition may not be amended or waived (other than a Permitted
Minimum Condition Modification); and (B) no change may be made to the Offer
that: (1) changes the form of consideration to be delivered by Merger
Subsidiary pursuant to the Offer; (2) decreases the Offer Price or the number
of shares of Company Common Stock sought to be purchased by Merger Subsidiary
in the Offer; (3) imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to the Offer
Conditions; or (4) except as provided in Section 2.01(d), extends the
expiration date of the Offer. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Offer
and this Agreement, Merger Subsidiary shall: (x) accept for payment all shares
of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the
Offer as soon as practicable after Merger Subsidiary is permitted to do so
under Applicable Law; and (y) pay the Offer Price in exchange for each share
of Company Common Stock accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer. For
purposes of this Agreement, a "Permitted Minimum Condition Modification" shall
mean a modification to the definition of Minimum Condition, which may be
effected at Parent's election and in Parent's sole discretion by delivering
written notice of such modification to the Company prior to the Acceptance
Time, to replace the reference to "66 2/3% of the Adjusted Outstanding Share
Number" in such definition with "66 2/3% of the aggregate number of
outstanding Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Acceptance Time"
(for the avoidance of doubt, effecting a Permitted Minimum Condition
Modification shall not constitute a waiver of the Minimum Condition for
purposes of this Agreement).

(d) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire 20 (twenty) Business Days
following the Offer Commencement Date (calculated as set forth in Rule
14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act) (the "Initial Expiration
Date," and such date or such subsequent date to which the expiration of the
Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the
"Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, but subject to the parties' respective termination rights under
Section 9.01: (i) if, as of the scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition
is not satisfied and has not been waived, Merger Subsidiary shall extend the
Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional period of up to 20 (twenty)
Business Days per extension, to permit such Offer Condition to be satisfied;
and (ii) Merger Subsidiary shall extend the Offer from time to time for any
period required by any rule or regulation of the SEC applicable to the Offer;
provided, however, that, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) of this Section
2.01(d), in no event shall Merger Subsidiary extend the Offer to a date later
than the End Date.

(e) On the Offer Commencement Date, Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall: (i)
cause to be filed with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (the
"Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer, which will contain or incorporate by
reference: (A) Merger Subsidiary's offer to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Offer (the "Offer to Purchase"); and (B) forms of the
related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement; and (ii) cause the
Offer to Purchase and related documents to be disseminated to holders of
shares of Company Common Stock as and to the extent required by the United
States securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall use reasonable efforts to cause
the Schedule TO, and all exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto
(collectively, the "Offer Documents"), to comply in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the Securities Act, as
applicable, and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company and its
legal counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Offer Documents (including all amendments and supplements thereto) prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC. Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
promptly provide the Company and its legal counsel with a copy or a
description of any comments received by Parent, Merger Subsidiary or their
legal counsel from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents.
Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary and the Company: (1) shall use reasonable
efforts to respond promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer; and (2) to the extent required by
the applicable requirements of United States securities laws and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, shall use reasonable efforts to
correct promptly any information provided by it for use in the

 Offer Documents to the extent such information shall be or shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect and Parent and Merger Subsidiary
shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents, as supplemented
or amended to correct such information, to be filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by the United States securities laws and the rules and
regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder, to be disseminated to holders
of shares of Company Common Stock. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Merger Subsidiary all information concerning the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries and the Company's stockholders that may be required or
reasonably requested in connection with any action contemplated by this
Section 2.01(e).

the Offer being referred to collectively as the "Board Recommendation"); and

modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, amend or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Board Recommendation.
Subject to Section 7.02, the Company consents to the inclusion of the Board
Recommendation in the Offer Documents.

(b) Contemporaneously with the filing by Parent and Merger Subsidiary of the
Schedule TO, the Company shall file with the SEC and (contemporaneously with

14D-9, and the Company shall not respond to the SEC prior to receiving the
approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or

the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the "Stockholder List Date"); and
(ii) such additional information (including updated lists of stockholders,
non-objecting beneficial owners, mailing labels and lists of securities
positions) and such other assistance as Parent may reasonably request in
connection with the Offer or the Merger. Prior to the filing with the SEC of
the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall set the Stockholder List Date as the
record date for the purpose of receiving the notice required by Section
262(d)(2) of Delaware Law.

(d) The parties to this Agreement expressly elect to have this Agreement and

beneficial owner of shares of Company Common Stock.

ARTICLE 3

soon as practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business Days) after
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions
to the Merger set forth in ARTICLE 8 (other than those conditions that by
their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such
conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms
or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.
The Closing

 shall be held at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and Manges LLP, 201 Redwood Shores
Parkway, Redwood Shores, California, unless another place is agreed to in
writing by the parties hereto.

Section 3.02. The Merger.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and pursuant
to Section 251(h) of Delaware Law, as soon as practicable after the Closing,
the Company shall file with the Delaware Secretary of State a certificate of
merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in connection with the Merger in
substantially the form attached as Exhibit C hereto (with such changes, if
any, as Parent may determine to be necessary to comply with Delaware Law).

(b) The Merger shall become effective on such date and at such time (the
"Effective Time") as the Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be agreed by the
parties that is specified in the Certificate of Merger).

(c) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). From and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and
franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions
and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under
Delaware Law.

(d) The Merger shall be governed by Section 251(h) of Delaware Law and
(without limiting any provision of Section 2.01 or the foregoing provisions of
this Section 3.02, except as required by Section 251(h) of Delaware Law) shall
be effected as soon as practicable following consummation of the Offer.

Section 3.03. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) except as otherwise provided in Section 3.03(b) or Section 3.05, each
share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash,
without interest and subject to any required Tax withholding (the "Merger
Consideration");

(b) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock
or owned by Ultimate Parent, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and no
payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

(c) each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one share of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 3.04. Surrender and Payment.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent (the
"Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
(i) certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") and (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Uncertificated Shares"). As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and

 Uncertificated Shares (the "Payment Fund"). Promptly after the Effective Time,
Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each record
holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock
represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and
validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents as may
reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an "agent's
message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as
the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry
transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, as the
case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent
after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive such
Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on the cash payable
upon the surrender or transfer of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such payment
to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates or
transfer of Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or
Uncertificated Shares and from and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration
provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in this ARTICLE
3.

(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock six (6) months after the Effective Time shall
be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged
shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with
this Section 3.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for
payment of the Merger Consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent
shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares
of Company Common Stock two (2) years after the Effective Time (or such
earlier date, immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority) shall become, to
the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear
of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to Section 3.05 in respect of any Dissenting Shares shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.

 Section 3.05. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 3.03, shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than shares of Company Common Stock canceled in accordance with
Section 3.03(b)) and held by a holder who has properly exercised appraisal
rights of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law (such
shares being referred to collectively as the "Dissenting Shares" until such
time as such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such
holder's appraisal rights under Delaware Law with respect to such shares)
shall not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but
instead shall be entitled to payment of the appraised value of such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law; provided that if, after the
Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holder's
right to appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of Delaware Law or if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of Delaware Law, such shares of Company Common
Stock shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section
3.03(a), without interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly
representing such share or transfer of such Uncertificated Share, as the case
may be. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, any
withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument
delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law
that relates to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right
to participate in all negotiations and Proceedings with respect to such
demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such
demands.

Section 3.06. Company Stock Options; Company RSUs; ESPP.

(a) At the Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holders thereof, the unvested portion of each Company
Compensatory Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that is held by a Person who is an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be assumed by
Ultimate Parent and converted automatically at the Effective Time into an
option or restricted stock unit, as the case may be, denominated in shares of
Ultimate Parent Stock and subject to terms and conditions substantially
identical to those in effect at the Effective Time (each such assumed unvested
portion of a Company Compensatory Award, an "Assumed Company Award"), except
that (i) the number of shares of Ultimate Parent Stock that will be subject to
each such Assumed Company Award shall be determined by multiplying the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Assumed Company Award by a
fraction (the "Award Exchange Ratio"), the numerator of which is the per share
Merger Consideration and the denominator of which is the average closing price
of Ultimate Parent Stock on the NYSE over the five (5) trading days
immediately preceding (but not including) the date on which the Effective Time
occurs (rounded down to the nearest whole share) and (ii) if applicable, the
exercise or purchase price per share of each such Assumed Company Award shall
equal (x) the per share exercise or purchase price of each such Assumed
Company Award divided by (y) the Award Exchange Ratio (rounded upwards to the
nearest whole cent); provided, however, that the assumption of the unvested
portion of a Company Stock Option shall be performed in a manner intended to
comply with the requirements of Sections 409A or 424(a) of the Code. At the
Effective Time, each Company Stock Plan pursuant to which any Assumed Company
Award has been granted shall be assumed by Ultimate Parent.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the vested portion (including any portion
that pursuant to its terms becomes vested solely as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) of each outstanding Company
Compensatory Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each such vested portion of a Company Compensatory Award, a "Cashed Out
Compensatory Award") shall not be assumed by the Ultimate Parent pursuant to
this Section 3.06 and shall, immediately prior to the Effective Time, be
cancelled and extinguished and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of
any such

 Cashed Out Compensatory Award shall have the right to receive an amount in
cash equal to the product of (x) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Cashed Out Compensatory Award immediately prior
to the Effective Time and (y) the Merger Consideration less any per share
exercise or purchase price of such Cashed Out Compensatory Award immediately
prior to such cancellation (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to
as the "Compensatory Award Payments"). From and after the Effective Time, any
such Cashed Out Compensatory Award shall no longer be exercisable by the
former holder thereof or settleable in shares, but shall entitle such holder
only to the payment of the Compensatory Award Payment; provided that any
Cashed Out Compensatory Award that has an exercise price or purchase price
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be cancelled without
any consideration therefor. The Compensatory Award Payments shall be paid as
soon as practicable following the Effective Time, without interest.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the unvested portion of each Company
Compensatory Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that is held by a Person who is not an employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each such unvested portion of a Company Compensatory Award,
a "Terminated Compensatory Award") shall not be assumed by the Ultimate Parent
pursuant to this Section 3.06 and shall, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, be cancelled and extinguished for no consideration. From and after the
Effective Time, any such Terminated Compensatory Award shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof or settleable in shares. The Company
shall take all action that may be necessary (under the Company Stock Plans,
applicable award agreements, Applicable Law or otherwise) to effect the
provisions of this Section 3.06(c) and to ensure that, from and after the
Effective Time, each holder of a Terminated Compensatory Award shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto.

(d) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the reservation,
issuance and listing of Ultimate Parent Stock as is necessary to effectuate
the transactions contemplated by Section 3.06(a). As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of
any Assumed Company Award or any Cashed Out Compensatory Award an appropriate
notice setting forth such holder's rights pursuant to such Assumed Company
Award or Cashed Out Compensatory Award, as applicable. Ultimate Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-8 with
respect to the shares of Ultimate Parent Stock issuable upon exercise of the
Assumed Company Awards promptly following the Effective Time (and in no event
later than 90 Business Days after the Effective Time) and Ultimate Parent
shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness
of such registration statement for so long as such Assumed Company Awards
remain outstanding. The Company and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate
with and assist Ultimate Parent in the preparation of such registration
statement. For the avoidance of doubt, the Form S-8 registration statement
shall not cover any Cashed Out Compensatory Awards.

(e) The Company shall take such action as may be necessary under the Company's
2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), to (i) terminate all purchase
periods under the ESPP as of the last day of the Company's first payroll
period ending after the date of this Agreement (the "Final Exercise Date");
(ii) provide that no further purchase periods shall commence under the ESPP on
or following the Final Exercise Date; and (iii) terminate the ESPP as of the
Final Exercise Date, subject to the Closing. Each outstanding right under the
ESPP on the Final Exercise Date shall be exercised on such date for the
purchase of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP and
any outstanding Company Common Stock obtained through the exercise of such
outstanding right shall be treated as set forth in Sections 3.03 and 3.04. The
Company shall provide timely notice of the setting of the Final Exercise Date
and termination of the ESPP in accordance with the terms of the ESPP.

 (f) Following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company Compensatory Award or
any participant in any Company Stock Plan, Company Employee Plan or employee
benefit arrangement of the Company or any individual party to an employment
agreement with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall have any right
hereunder or otherwise to acquire any Equity Interest (including any "phantom"
stock or stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
the Surviving Corporation.

(g) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all
such actions as are necessary (under the Company Stock Plan, applicable award
agreements, Applicable Law or otherwise) to effect the foregoing provisions of
this Section 3.06, including by amending the applicable Company Stock Plans or
the ESPP.

Section 3.07. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock split) or combination,
exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend, or any similar
transaction, or any record date for any such purpose shall be established, the
Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant
to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

Section 3.08. Withholding Rights. Each of Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the
Surviving Corporation and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of any applicable
Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent,
Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the
case may be, and are paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.

Section 3.09. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated under this ARTICLE
3.

ARTICLE 4 
THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

Section 4.01. Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of incorporation
of the Company shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in its entirety
as set forth in Exhibit C hereto and, as so amended, shall be the certificate
of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
Applicable Law.

Section 4.02. Bylaws. The bylaws of the Company shall be amended at the
Effective Time to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Merger Subsidiary in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and as so amended shall be the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
Applicable Law.

 Section 4.03. Directors and Officers. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
Applicable Law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and
(ii) the officers of Merger Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

ARTICLE 5 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Except (a) as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents (other than as set forth
in the forward-looking statements or as set forth in the risk factors
contained therein) filed or furnished on or after January 9, 2013 and prior to
the date of this Agreement or (b) as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule
delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Subsidiary prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Schedule"), which
identifies items of disclosure by reference to a particular Section or
subsection of this Agreement, the Company hereby represents and warrants to
Parent and Merger Subsidiary as follows:

Section 5.01. Corporate Existence and Power. The Company is a corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all corporate powers required to carry on its
business as now conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such
qualification is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be
so qualified would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore
delivered to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company as currently in effect. The Company
has heretofore made available to Parent complete and correct copies of the
minutes (or, in the case of draft minutes, the most recent drafts thereof) of
all meetings of the stockholders of the Company, the Company Board and each
committee of the Company Board and the Boards of Directors (or similar
governing bodies) and each committee thereof of each of the Company's
Subsidiaries held since January 1, 2013; provided that, with respect to
meetings for which draft or final minutes are not yet available, the Company
has provided to Parent a materially complete and correct summary thereof.

Section 5.02. Corporate Authorization.

(g) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of
this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company. No vote of the holders of
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock is required to approve and adopt
this Agreement and the Merger. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law affecting creditors'
rights generally and by general principles of equity.

(h) At a meeting duly called and held, prior to the execution of this
Agreement, at which all directors of the Company were present and voting in
favor, the Company Board (upon the unanimous recommendation of the Special
Committee) duly adopted resolutions (i) declaring that this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to, advisable
and in the best interests of the Company's stockholders, (ii) approving this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
taking all actions necessary so that the restrictions on business combinations
and stockholder vote requirements contained in Section 203 of the Delaware Law
will not apply with respect to or as a result of

 the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement, the Tender and Support Agreements and
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and (iv) making the Board
Recommendation; and such board resolutions have not been rescinded, modified
or withdrawn in any way.

(c) The Company Board has duly authorized and approved the entry into this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
Section 251(h) of Delaware Law. No provision of the Company's certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (i) requires a vote of the stockholders of the Company
to approve the Offer, this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) prohibits the
Company and Parent from completing the Merger pursuant to Section 251(h) of
Delaware Law. Absent Section 251(h) of Delaware Law, the affirmative vote of
the holders of not less than 66 2/3% of the voting power of the shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding would be the only vote of the holders of
Company Common Stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and approve the other
transactions contemplated hereby under Delaware Law, the Company's certificate
of incorporation and bylaws. Immediately prior to the Company's execution of
this Agreement, the shares of Company Common Stock are listed on a national
securities exchange or are held of record by more than 2,000 holders.

Section 5.03. Governmental Authorization. The execution, delivery and
performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than (i) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of other jurisdictions in
which the Company is qualified to do business, (ii) compliance with any
applicable requirements of (A) the HSR Act and (B) any Applicable Law
analogous to the HSR Act or otherwise regulating antitrust or merger control
matters and in each case existing in foreign jurisdictions (the "Foreign
Competition Laws"), (iii) compliance with any applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any other applicable U.S. state or federal
or foreign securities laws, or the NYSE, and (iv) any actions or filings the
absence of which would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.04. Non-contravention. The execution, delivery and performance by
the Company of this Agreement, the purchase of the shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer and the consummation by the Company of
the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby do not
and will not (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both): (i)
contravene, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company, (ii)
assuming compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03, contravene,
conflict with or result in a violation or breach of any provision of any
Applicable Law or Order, (iii) require any consent or approval under, violate,
conflict with, result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or
constitute a change of control or default under, or result in termination or
give to others any right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, any Contract to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties or
assets may be bound or affected or any Governmental Authorization affecting,
or relating in any way to, the property, assets or business of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, with such
exceptions, in the case of each of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, provided that in determining whether a Company
Material Adverse Effect would result, any adverse effect otherwise excluded by
clause (A) of the definition of Company Material Adverse Effect shall be taken
into account.

Section 5.05. Capitalization.

 (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) 90,000,000
shares of Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the
"Company Common Stock"), and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.001 per share (the "Company Preferred Stock"). The rights and
privileges of the Company Common Stock and the Company Preferred Stock are as
set forth in the Company's certificate of incorporation. At the close of
business on April 26, 2016, 26,253,884 shares of Company Common Stock were
issued and outstanding (none of which were in respect of shares of restricted
stock), 696,379 shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company as
treasury shares, and no shares of Company Preferred Stock were issued and
outstanding; warrants to purchase 1,214,366 shares of Common Stock of the
Company were issued and outstanding; Company Stock Options to purchase an
aggregate of 3,009,410 shares of Company Common Stock were issued and
outstanding (of which Company Stock Options to purchase an aggregate of
2,763,868 shares of Company Common Stock were exercisable), with a weighted
average exercise price of $19.10; an aggregate of 918,431 shares of Company
Common Stock were reserved for settlement of Company RSUs; and no shares of
Company Common Stock were reserved for settlement of Company Compensatory
Awards other than Company Stock Options and Company RSUs. No shares of Company
Common Stock are held by any Subsidiary of the Company. All outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company have been, and all shares that may be issued
pursuant to any Company Stock Plan will be, when issued in accordance with the
respective terms thereof, duly authorized and validly issued and are (or, in
the case of shares that have not yet been issued, will be) fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights.

(b) Section 5.05(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
close of business on April 26, 2016, a complete and correct list of all
outstanding Company Compensatory Awards under the Company Stock Plans,
including with respect to each such award, (i) the number of shares initially
subject to such award, (ii) the name of the holder, (iii) the grant date, (iv)
as to Company Stock Options, whether the award was intended as of its date of
grant to be an "incentive stock option" under Section 422 of the Code or a
non-qualified stock option, (v) the exercise or purchase price per share, (vi)
the vesting schedule and vesting conditions (including the extent to which it
will become accelerated as a result of the Offer or the Merger) and vested
status of each such award and (vii) the expiration date of each such award.
The Company Stock Plans set forth in Section 5.05(b) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule are the only plans or programs the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has maintained under which stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock
units, stock appreciation rights or other compensatory equity-based awards
have been or may be granted. Each form of award agreement and each agreement
that deviates from the forms is set forth in Section 5.05(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. With respect to the Company Compensatory Awards, (i) each
grant was duly authorized no later than the date on which the grant of such
award was by its terms to be effective (the "Grant Date") by all necessary
corporate action and (ii) each such grant was made in accordance with the
terms of the Company Stock Plan under which it was granted and all Applicable
Laws.

(c) Except as set forth in this Section 5.05 and for changes since April 26,
2016 resulting from the exercise of Company Compensatory Awards outstanding on
such date, there are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or voting
securities or other Equity Interests of the Company, (ii) securities of the
Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock or voting
securities or other Equity Interests of the Company, (iii) options, warrants
or other rights or arrangements to acquire from the Company, or other
obligations or commitments of the Company to issue, any capital stock or other
voting securities, ownership interests or Equity Interests in, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or other voting
securities, ownership interests or Equity Interests in, the Company, or (iv)
restricted shares, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, contingent
value rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or rights that are
derivative of, or provide economic benefits based, directly or indirectly, on
the value or price of, any capital stock of, or other voting securities,
ownership interests or Equity Interests in, the Company

 (the items in clauses (c)(i)-(c)(iv) being referred to collectively as the
"Company Securities"), (v) voting trusts, proxies or other similar agreements
or understandings to which Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound with respect to the
voting of any shares of capital stock of Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(vi) contractual obligations or commitments of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries of any character restricting the transfer of, or requiring the
registration for sale of, any shares of capital stock of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no outstanding obligations or commitments of any
character of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities. All Company Compensatory
Awards may, by their terms, be treated in accordance with Section 3.06. No
Subsidiary of the Company owns any Company Securities.

(d) Section 5.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, as of the
date hereof, a complete and correct list of all outstanding warrants to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock, including with respect to each such
warrant, (i) the number of shares subject to such warrant, (ii) the name of
the holder, (iii) the grant date, (iv) the exercise or purchase price per
share, and (v) the expiration date of each such warrant.

Section 5.06. Subsidiaries.

(a) Section 5.06(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete
and correct list of each Subsidiary of the Company, its place and form of
organization and each jurisdiction in which it is authorized to conduct or
actually conducts business.

(b) Each Subsidiary of the Company is a corporation or other business entity
duly incorporated or organized (as applicable), validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation or organization
and has all corporate or other organizational powers required to carry on its
business as now conducted. Each such Subsidiary is duly qualified to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such qualification
is necessary, except for those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified
or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Section 5.06(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, for each
Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable: (i) its authorized capital stock,
voting securities or ownership interests; (ii) the number and type of any
capital stock, voting securities or ownership interests, and any option,
warrant, right or security (including debt securities) convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable therefor, outstanding; and (iii) the record
owner(s) thereof. All of the outstanding capital stock of, or other voting
securities or ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company, is owned
by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of
any other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other voting
securities or ownership interests). There are no outstanding (x) securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in
any Subsidiary of the Company, (y) options, warrants or other rights or
arrangements to acquire from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or other
obligations or commitments of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
any capital stock or other voting securities or ownership interests in, or any

voting securities or ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company, or
(z) restricted shares, stock appreciation rights, performance shares,
contingent value rights, "phantom" stock or similar securities or rights that
are derivative of, or provide economic benefits based, directly or indirectly,
on the value or price of, any capital stock of, or other voting securities or
ownership interests in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items set forth in
Section 5.06(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule being referred

 to collectively as the "Company Subsidiary Securities"). There are no
outstanding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of the Company Subsidiary
Securities. All of the Company Subsidiary Securities are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(d) Except for the Company Subsidiary Securities, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly owns any capital stock of, or other
equity, ownership, profit, voting or similar interest in, or any interest
convertible, exchangeable or exercisable for any equity, ownership, profit,
voting or similar interest in, any Person.

Section 5.07. SEC Filings and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

(a) The Company has delivered, or otherwise made available through filings
with the SEC, to Parent complete and correct copies of (i) its Registration
Statement on Form S-1 filed with the SEC on April 5, 2013 and all amendments
thereto; (ii) the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K for its fiscal years
ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and September 30, 2013, (iii) its
proxy or information statements relating to meetings of the stockholders of
the Company since June 6, 2013, and (iv) all of its other reports, statements,

(the documents referred to in this Section 5.07(a) and Section 5.07(e),
together with all information incorporated by reference therein in accordance
with applicable SEC regulations, are collectively referred to in this
Agreement as the "Company SEC Documents").

(b) Since June 6, 2013, the Company has filed with or furnished to the SEC
each report, statement, schedule, form or other document or filing required by
Applicable Law to be filed or furnished by the Company at or prior to the time
so required. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file or furnish any
report, statement, schedule, form or other document with, or make any other
filing with, or furnish any other material to, the SEC.

(c) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document
complied, and each such Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date
hereof and prior to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger will comply,
as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may
be.

(d) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date hereof, on the date of such filing), each Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the Exchange Act did not, and each such Company SEC Document filed
subsequent to the date hereof and prior to the consummation of the Offer and
the Merger will not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. Each Company SEC Document that is a registration statement, as
amended or supplemented, if applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act,
as of the date such registration statement or amendment became effective, did
not, and each such Company SEC Document filed subsequent to the date hereof
and prior to the consummation of the Offer and the Merger will not, contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

(e) The Company has delivered, or otherwise made available through filings
with the SEC, to Parent copies of all comment letters received by the Company
from the SEC since April 5, 2013 relating to the Company SEC Documents,
together with all written responses of the Company thereto. There are no
outstanding or unresolved comments in any such comment letters received by the
Company from the SEC.

 To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Documents is the
subject of any ongoing review by the SEC.

(f) Each required form, report and document containing financial statements
that has been filed with or submitted to the SEC by the Company since June 6,
2013 was accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or submitted
by the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer,
as required, pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, at the time of filing or
submission of each such certification, such certification was true and
accurate and complied with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. None of the Company, any
current executive officer of the Company or, to the Knowledge of the Company,

Section 5.08. Financial Statements; Internal Controls.

(a) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited consolidated
interim financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC
Documents (i) complied as to form, as of their respective filing dates with
the SEC, in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements
and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii)
were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except, in the case of unaudited statements, for the absence
of footnotes), and (iii) fairly presented (except as may be indicated in the
notes thereto) in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and
their consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then
ended (subject to normal year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited
interim financial statements).

(b) The Company's system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is sufficient
in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures are executed in
accordance with the authorization of management, and (iii) that any
unauthorized use, acquisition or disposition of the Company's assets that
would materially affect the Company's financial statements would be detected
or prevented in a timely manner. There were no significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses identified in management's assessment of internal controls
as of and for the year-ended December 31, 2015 (nor has any such deficiency or
weakness been identified since such date).

(c) The Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that (i) all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to the
individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Company's management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

(d) Since June 6, 2013, neither the principal executive officer nor the
principal financial officer of the Company has become aware of any fact,
circumstance or change that is reasonably likely to result in a "significant
deficiency" or a "material weakness" in the Company's internal controls over
financial reporting.

 (e) The audit committee of the Company Board includes an Audit Committee
Financial Expert, as defined by Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K.

(f) The Company has adopted a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406(b) of
Regulation S-K, for senior financial officers, applicable to its principal
financial officer, comptroller or principal accounting officer, or persons
performing similar functions. The Company has promptly disclosed any change in
or waiver of the Company's code of ethics with respect to any such persons, as
required by Section 406(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the Knowledge of the
Company, there have been no violations of provisions of the Company's code of
ethics by any such persons.

the Code, and (iii) all other filings and material correspondence with any
Governmental Authority with respect to each Company Employee Plan.

 (b) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate nor any predecessor thereof
sponsors, maintains or contributes or is obligated to contribute to, or has in
the past sponsored, maintained or contributed or been obligated to contribute
to, any Company Employee Plan subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or
Section 412 of the Code, any defined benefit plan, any "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) or 3(37) of ERISA, or any "multiple

permitted to rely on a favorable opinion letter, in either case, that has not
been revoked, or has pending or has time remaining in which to file an
application for such determination from the Internal Revenue Service, and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, there is no reason why any such determination
letter would reasonably be expected to be revoked or not be issued. Each trust
established in connection with any Company Employee Plan which is intended to
be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code is so
exempt, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has occurred
that could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the exempt status of any
such trust. To the Knowledge of the Company, there has not been any prohibited
transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code) with respect to any Company Employee Plan.

(d) Each Company Employee Plan has been maintained and administered in
material compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any
and all Applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code, which are applicable to
such Company Employee Plan. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
performed all material obligations required to be performed by it under all
Company Employee Plans. No events have occurred with respect to any Company
Employee Plan that could result in a material payment or assessment by or
against the Company of any excise Taxes under Sections 4972, 4975, 4976, 4977,
4979, 4980B, 4980D, 4980E or 5000 of the Code.

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Company Employee Plan is under audit
or is subject of an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S.
Department of Labor, the SEC, the PBGC or any other Governmental Authority.

(f) The execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not (either alone or together with any
other event) (i) entitle any current or former employee, director or
independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any pay or
benefits under any Company Employee Plan; (ii) accelerate the time of payment
or vesting of any compensation or equity-based award; (iii) trigger any

under any Company Employee Plan; or (iv) trigger any payment, increase the
amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant to any
Company Employee Plan.

any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that, individually or collectively, (i) would entitle any employee or former
employee to any severance or other payment as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby (either alone or together with any other event), or (ii)
could give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible
pursuant to the terms of Sections 280G or 162(m) of the Code or result in
excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code. There is no employee plan,
arrangement or other Contract by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is bound to compensate any employee for excise Taxes paid pursuant to Section
4999 of the Code.

 (h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability in
respect of post-retirement health, medical or life insurance benefits for
retired, former or current employees or directors of the Company or its
Subsidiaries except as required to comply with Section 4980B of the Code or
any similar state law provision.

(i) There is no material action, suit, investigation, audit or other
Proceeding pending against or involving or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or involving any Company Employee Plan before any
arbitrator or any Governmental Authority.

(j) Each Company Employee Plan which is a "non-qualified deferred compensation
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code) has, at all
times, been administered and documented in compliance with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance issued thereunder, in all
cases so that the additional Tax described in Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the
Code will not be assessed against the individuals participating in any such
non-qualified deferred compensation plan with respect to benefits due or
accruing thereunder. No Company employee plan, arrangement or other Contract
provides a gross-up or other indemnification for any Taxes that may be imposed
for failure to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(k) Each Company Stock Option was granted with a per share exercise price that
is not less than the fair market value of a share of Company Common Stock on
the Grant Date as determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and
is exempt from the additional Tax and interest described in Section
409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code. Each Company RSU is exempt from Section 409A of the
Code. Each Company Stock Option characterized by the Company as an "incentive
stock option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code complies with all
of the applicable requirements of Section 422 of the Code.

(l) Each material International Plan is listed on Section 5.16(l) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule. With respect to each International Plan, (i) such
International Plan is in material compliance with the Applicable Law of each
jurisdiction in which such International Plan is maintained, (ii) all
contributions to, and material payments from, such International Plan which
may have been required to be made in accordance with the terms of such
International Plan, and, when applicable, the Applicable Law of the
jurisdiction in which such International Plan is maintained, have been timely
made or shall be made by the Closing Date, and all such contributions to such
International Plan, and all payments under such International Plan, for any
period ending before the Closing Date that are not yet, but will be, required
to be made, are reflected as an accrued liability on the Company Balance
Sheet, (iii) the Company, each Subsidiary and each ERISA Affiliate has
materially complied with all applicable reporting and notice requirements with
respect to such International Plan, and such International Plan has obtained
from the Governmental Authority having jurisdiction with respect to such
International Plan any required determinations that such International Plan is
in compliance in all material respects with the Applicable Law of the relevant
jurisdiction if such determinations are required in order to give effect to
such International Plan, (iv) such International Plan has been administered in
all material respects at all times in accordance with its terms and all
Applicable Law, (v) to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no pending
investigations by any Governmental Authority involving such International
Plan, and no pending claims (except for claims for benefits payable in the
normal operation of such International Plan), suits or other Proceedings
against such International Plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits
under such International Plan, (vi) the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will not by itself create or otherwise result
in any liability with respect to such International Plan, and (vii) except as
required by Applicable Law, no condition exists that would prevent the Company
from terminating or amending any International Plan at any time for any reason
in accordance with the terms of each such International Plan without the
payment of any fees, costs or expenses (other than the payment of benefits
accrued on the Company Balance Sheet and any normal and

 reasonable expenses typically incurred in a termination event). The benefits
available under all International Plans in the aggregate do not provide
materially greater benefits to employees of the Company participating in such
plans than the benefits available under the Company Employee Plans for
employees of the Company in the United States. No International Plan has
unfunded liabilities that will not be offset by insurance or that are not
fully accrued on the financial statements of the Company.

(m) There does not now exist, nor do any circumstances exist that would

be a liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates
at or following the Effective Time.

hours provided for informational purposes only to Parent), but in each case
under the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), only if the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel to the Company
Board, that the failure to take such action would be a breach of its fiduciary
duties to the stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law.

(c) The Company Board shall not take any of the actions referred to in clause
(i) or (ii) of Section 7.02(b) unless the Company shall have notified Parent
in writing at least twenty-four (24) hours before taking such action that it
intends to take such action (it being understood that (i) the Company shall
only be required to provide the notice required by this sentence to Parent on
one (1) occasion with respect to any particular Third Party and (ii) this
parenthetical shall have no impact on the notification and other obligations
of the Company contained in the remainder of this Section 7.02(c)). The
Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours)
after it obtains knowledge of the receipt by the Company (or any of its
Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry, offer or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for non-public information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or
records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any Third Party, in each
case in connection with any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, offer or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. In such
notice, the Company shall identify the Third Party making, and the material
terms and conditions of, any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, offer,
proposal or request. Commencing upon the provision of any notice referred to
above, the Company shall (A) on a reasonable and prompt basis at a mutually
agreeable time, advise Parent (or its counsel) of the progress of negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal, the material resolved and unresolved
issues related thereto and any other material matters identified with
reasonable specificity by Parent (or its counsel) and the material details
(including material amendments or proposed amendments as to price and other
material terms) of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry and (B)
promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent (or its outside
counsel) with copies of all material documents and material written or
electronic communications relating to any such Acquisition Proposal (including
the financing thereof), request or inquiry exchanged between the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making an Acquisition
Proposal or any of its Affiliates, or their respective officers, directors,
employees, or Representatives, on the other hand. The Company shall promptly
provide Parent with any non-public information concerning the business,
present or future performance, financial condition or results of operations of
the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries), provided to any Third Party that was
not previously provided to Parent. The Company shall provide Parent with at
least 48 hours' prior notice (or such lesser

 period of prior notice provided to the members of the Company Board) of any
meeting of the Company Board at which the Company Board is reasonably expected
to consider any Acquisition Proposal.

(d) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to
make, withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
amend or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Board
Recommendation, (ii) approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose
to approve, endorse, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal or Superior
Proposal, (iii) fail to recommend against acceptance of any tender offer or
exchange offer (other than the Offer or any other tender offer or exchange
offer by Parent or Merger Subsidiary) for the Company Common Stock within ten
(10) Business Days after the commencement of such offer, (iv) make any public
statement inconsistent with the Board Recommendation, (v) resolve or agree to
take any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, an "Adverse
Recommendation Change"), or (vi) resolve or agree to change or modify the
election that this Agreement and the Merger be governed pursuant to Section
251(h) of Delaware Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board,
following receipt of and on account of a Superior Proposal, may (i) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in accordance with
the terms of Section 9.01(d)(i), but only if, in either case, the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel
to the Company Board, that the failure to take such action would be a breach
of its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, however, that the
Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01(d)(i), unless (A) the Company
promptly notifies Parent (the "Adverse Recommendation Change Notice"), in
writing at least three (3) Business Days before making an Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement (the "Notice Period"), of
its intention to take such action or actions with respect to a Superior
Proposal, (B) the Company attaches to such notice the most current version of
the proposed agreement or a reasonably detailed summary of all material terms
of any such Superior Proposal (which version or summary shall be updated on a
prompt basis) and the identity of the Third Party making the Superior
Proposal, (C) the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal
advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal, if Parent,
in its discretion, proposes to make such adjustments (it being understood and
agreed (x) that in the event that, after commencement of the Notice Period,
there is any material revision to the terms of a Superior Proposal, including,
any revision in price, the Notice Period shall be extended, if applicable, to
ensure that at least three (3) Business Days remains in the Notice Period
subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent of any such material
revision and (y) that there may be multiple extensions of the Notice Period);
and (D) Parent does not make, within the Notice Period, an offer that is
determined by the Company Board in good faith, after consulting with its
outside counsel and financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, to
be at least as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior
Proposal.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company Board may, in response to a material fact, event, change, development
or set of circumstances (other than an Acquisition Proposal occurring or
arising after the date of this Agreement) that was not known to the Company
Board nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of or prior to the
date of this Agreement (and not relating in any way to any Acquisition
Proposal) (such material fact, event, change, development or set of
circumstances, an "Intervening Event"), withdraw or modify, or fail to make,
in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Board Recommendation
(which shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change) if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel
to the Company Board, that, in light of such Intervening Event, the failure of
the Company Board to effect such an Adverse Recommendation Change would be in
breach of its fiduciary duties under

 Applicable Law; provided that no fact, event, change, development or set of
circumstances shall constitute an Intervening Event if such fact, event,
change, development or set of circumstances resulted from or arose out of the
announcement, pendency or consummation of the Offer or the Merger; and
provided, further, that the Company Board shall not be entitled to exercise
its right to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this clause (e)
unless the Company Board has (A) provided to Parent at least four (4) Business
Days' prior written notice advising Parent that the Company Board intends to
take such action and specifying the facts underlying the Company Board's
determination that an Intervening Event has occurred, and the reasons for the
Adverse Recommendation Change, in reasonable detail, and (B) during such four
(4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, engaged in good faith
negotiations with Parent to amend this Agreement in such a manner that
obviates the need for an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of the
Intervening Event.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 7.02 shall prevent the Company Board
from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act with
regard to an Acquisition Proposal; provided that any such disclosure (other
than a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Section 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed
to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly
publicly reaffirms the Board Recommendation (i) in such communication or (ii)
within two (2) Business Days after requested to do so by Parent.

Section 7.03. Access to Information. From the date hereof until the Effective
Time, the Company shall (i) give to Parent and its Representatives reasonable
access to the offices, properties, books, records, Contracts, Governmental
Authorizations, documents, directors, officers and employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries during normal business hours,(ii) furnish to Parent and
its Representatives such financial, Tax and operating data and other
information as such Persons may reasonably request (including the work papers
of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP upon receipt of any required consent from
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP), and (iii) instruct its Representatives to
cooperate with Parent and its Representatives in its investigation; provided,
however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that
(A) any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or prohibit access to
any such properties or information, (B) such disclosure would, based on the
advice of such party's counsel, result in a waiver of attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or any other applicable privilege applicable
to such information or (C) the disclosure of such information would violate
confidentiality obligations owed to a third party and such confidentiality
obligations were in effect prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement; provided, however, that with respect to clauses (B) and (C) of this
Section 7.03, the Company shall use its best efforts to develop an alternative
method for providing such information to Parent. Any investigation pursuant to
this Section 7.03 shall be conducted in such manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the Company.

Section 7.04. Notice of Certain Events.

(a) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company
and its Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, subject to Applicable Law, the Executive Officers of the Company,
including but not limited to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, shall
consult in good faith on a reasonable and prompt basis with Parent to report
material (individually or in the aggregate)

 operational developments, the status of relationships with customers,
resellers, partners, suppliers, licensors, licensees, distributors and others
having material business relationships with the Company, the status of ongoing
operations and other matters reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to
procedures reasonably requested by Parent; provided that no such consultation
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or
obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of:

(i) any written notice or other written communication (or, to the Knowledge of
the Company, any other notice or communication) from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iii) any Proceeding commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that, if pending on the date of this
Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed pursuant to
Sections 5.12, 5.13, 5.15 or Section 5.16, as the case may be, or that relate
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(iv) any written notice or other written communication (or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, any other notice or communication) from any Major Customer or
Major Supplier that such Major Customer or Major Supplier is terminating its
relationship with Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(v) any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty or breach of covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement at any time during the term hereof that
would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth in Exhibit B
not to be satisfied.

Section 7.05. 401(k) Plans. Effective as of the Business Day immediately
preceding the Acceptance Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent
at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company and
each Subsidiary thereof shall take all actions necessary to effect the
termination of any and all Company Employee Plans intended to qualify as a
qualified cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code, and
effective as of the Business Day immediately preceding the Acceptance Time, no
Company employee shall have any right thereafter to contribute any amounts to
any Company Employee Plan intended to qualify as a qualified cash or deferred
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code. The Company shall provide Parent
with evidence that each such Company Employee Plan has been terminated
pursuant to an action by the Company Board or the board of directors of a
Subsidiary, as applicable.

Section 7.06. State Takeover Laws. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover Applicable Law becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary, the Offer,
the Merger, the Tender and Support Agreements or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger
Subsidiary, and their respective Board of Directors shall grant such approvals
and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated
hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated
hereby and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law
inapplicable to the foregoing.

 Section 7.07. Obligations of Merger Subsidiary. Parent shall cause Merger
Subsidiary to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

Section 7.08. Director and Officer Liability.

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers' and directors' liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time covering each such person currently covered by the Company's officers'
and directors' liability insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage
and amount no less favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date
hereof; provided that in satisfying its obligation under this Section 7.08(a),
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the Company paid with
respect to the twelve-month period ending June 20, 2016 (the "Current
Premium"), which amount is set forth in Section 7.08(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed 200% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause
to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving Corporation's
judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to
200% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid "tail" or "runoff"
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time (and which the Company
may obtain prior to the Effective Time notwithstanding any restrictions
otherwise set forth in this Agreement other than the restrictions set forth in
the proviso at the end of this sentence), which policies provide such
directors and officers with coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before
the Effective Time, including, in respect of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
of the Company shall pay more than 200% of the Current Premium for such
prepaid policies without the prior written consent of Parent. If such prepaid
policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect for their
full term, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

(b) From and after the Effective Time through the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to: (i)
each indemnification agreement set forth on Section 7.08(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any
person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties"); and (ii) any
indemnification provision and any exculpation provision set forth in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date
of this Agreement; provided that such obligations shall be subject to any
limitation imposed by the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company as in effect on the date of this Agreement and any limitations imposed
from time to time under Applicable Law. If, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party delivers to the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable, a written notice
asserting a claim for indemnification under any of the provisions set forth in
clause (i) or (ii) above, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time until such claim is fully and
finally resolved.

(c) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i)consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the

 successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.08.

(d) The obligations under this Section 7.08 shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without
the written consent of such Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that
the Indemnified Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Section
7.08 and shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

Section 7.09. Reasonable Best Efforts.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with
the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Applicable Law, Contracts and otherwise to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings
(including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of
all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from,
or to avoid an action or other Proceeding by, any Governmental Authorities,
(ii) the delivery of required notices to, and the obtaining of required
consents or waivers from, Third Parties and (iii) the execution and delivery
of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger
and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 7.09, each of Parent and the Company shall (i) provide or cause to be
provided as promptly as practicable to Governmental Authorities with
regulatory jurisdiction over enforcement of any Antitrust Laws (each such
Governmental Authority, a "Governmental Antitrust Authority") information and
documents requested by any Governmental Antitrust Authority or necessary,
proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including preparing and filing any notification and report
form and related material required under the HSR Act and any additional
consents and filings under any Antitrust Laws as promptly as practicable
following the date of this Agreement (but in no event more than twelve (12)
Business Days from the date hereof except by mutual consent confirmed in
writing) and thereafter to respond as promptly as practicable to any request
for additional information or documentary material that may be made under the
HSR Act and any additional consents and filings under any Antitrust Laws; and
(ii) use their reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary
or advisable to obtain prompt approval of consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by any Governmental Authority.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in connection with the
receipt of any necessary governmental approvals or clearances (including under
any Antitrust Law), nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent or any of
its Affiliates to, nor shall the Company or any of its Affiliates without the
prior written consent of Parent agree or proffer to, divest, hold separate, or
enter into any license or similar agreement with respect to, or agree to
restrict the ownership or operation of, or agree to conduct or operate in a
specified manner, any portion of the business or assets of Parent, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, in no event shall Parent or any of its Affiliates be
obligated to litigate or participate in the litigation of any Proceeding,
whether judicial or administrative, brought by any Governmental Authority or
appeal any Order (i) challenging or seeking to make illegal, delay materially
or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or prohibit the Offer or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or seeking to obtain from Parent or any of its Affiliates any
damages in connection therewith, or (ii) seeking to prohibit or limit in any
respect, or place any conditions on, the ownership or operation by the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates

 of all or any portion of the business, assets or any product of the Company or
any of its Affiliates or Parent or any of its Affiliates or to require any
such Person to dispose of, license (whether pursuant to an exclusive or
nonexclusive license) or enter into a consent decree or hold separate all or
any portion of the business, assets or any product of the Company or any of
its Affiliates or Parent or any of its Affiliates, in each case as a result of
or in connection with the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense of any Proceeding against the Company and/or its directors relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will obtain the prior
written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying any such Proceeding.

(d) Subject to Applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, the
Company and Parent and their respective counsel shall (i) have the right to
review in advance, and to the extent practicable each shall consult the other
on, any filing made with, or written materials to be submitted to, any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) promptly inform each other of any communication (or other
correspondence or memoranda) received from, or given to, the U.S. Department
of Justice, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or any other Governmental
Antitrust Authority and (iii) promptly furnish each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings and written communications between them or their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
its respective staff, on the other hand, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent shall, to the extent
practicable, provide the other party and its counsel with advance notice of
and the opportunity to participate in any discussion, telephone call or
meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation or other inquiry in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to participate in the preparation for such
discussion, telephone call or meeting. Neither Parent nor the Company shall
commit to or agree with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or applicable Foreign Competition
Laws, without the prior written consent of the other. The Company and Parent
may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this Section
7.09(d) as "Antitrust Counsel Only Material." Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 7.09(d), materials provided to the other party or its
counsel may be redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(e) Each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary agrees that, between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, each of Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall
not, and shall ensure that none of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates shall,
take any action or propose, announce an intention or agree, in writing or
otherwise, to take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially
delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) The Company has provided Parent with all information requested by Parent
to evaluate which Governmental Authorities shall require Antitrust Filings.
Set forth on Section 7.09(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule is (i) a list
of each country in which the Company and any of its Subsidiaries generated
revenue in the last completed fiscal year and the most recent twelve (12)
month period, and the total revenue the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
generated in each such country in the last completed fiscal year and the most
recent twelve (12) month period; and (ii) a schedule of each country in which
the Company maintains one or more Subsidiaries, offices, or personnel.

Section 7.10. Certain Filings. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one
another (i) in determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing
with, any Governmental Authority is required, or any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Material
Contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and

 (ii) in taking such reasonable actions or making any such filings, furnishing
information required in connection therewith or with the Offer Documents and
seeking timely to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

Section 7.11. Public Announcements. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing any press release or making any other public
statement, or scheduling a press conference or conference call with investors
or analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any such other
public statement without the consent of the other party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, except (a) as such release or announcement may be
required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any
national securities exchange or association upon which the securities of the
Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, or (b) as such release or
announcement may be made with respect to an Adverse Recommendation Change
effected in accordance with Section 7.02, in which case the party required to
make the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and
allow the other party reasonable time (taking into account the circumstances)
to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance, and
the party will consider such comments in good faith.

Section 7.12. Further Assurances. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take
and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and
under any of the rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Offer and the Merger.

Section 7.13. Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company may
approve, in accordance with the procedures set forth in Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act and in accordance with the Interpretative Letter dated
January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC relating to Rule 16b-3, any dispositions of
equity securities of the Company (including derivative securities with respect
to equity securities of the Company) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each officer or director of the Company who
is subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act with respect to equity securities
of the Company.

Section 7.14. Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
(acting through the Company Board and its compensation committee) shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d−10(d)
promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment compensation, severance or
other employee benefit arrangement entered into on or after the date hereof by
the Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates with current or
future directors, officers or employees of the Company and its Affiliates and
to ensure that any such arrangements fall within the safe harbor provisions of
such Rule.

Section 7.15. Delisting. The Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its
part under Applicable Law (including the rules and regulations of the NYSE to
enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock
from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Common Stock under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

 Section 7.16. Confidentiality. Parent and the Company hereby acknowledge and
agree to continue to be bound by the Confidential Disclosure Agreement dated
as of December 21, 2015 by and between Ultimate Parent and the Company (the
"Confidentiality Agreement").

Section 7.17. Employee Matters.

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who continue
employment with the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation following the Effective Time ("Continuing Employees"), Parent
shall use reasonable efforts to cause the service of each such Continuing
Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date to be
recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but
not for benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan) and vesting
under each compensation, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan,
program or arrangement of Parent, Ultimate Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Affiliates as if such service were with Parent,
Ultimate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates to the same extent for participants generally under the applicable
plan of Parent, Ultimate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates, but not including any sabbatical or equity compensation
plans, programs, agreements or arrangements (collectively, the "Parent Benefit
Plans") in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to
participate, but solely to the extent service was credited to such employee
for such purposes under a comparable Company Employee Plan immediately prior
to the Closing Date and to the extent such credit would not result in a
duplication of benefits.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit Plan
that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA) in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate,
Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent Benefit Plan to
(i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods,
required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to participation
and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit Plan for such
Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same extent that
such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical examinations
and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived under the
corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a
participant immediately prior to such Continuing Employee's commencement of
participation in such Parent Benefit Plan but, with respect to long-term
disability and life insurance benefits and coverage, solely to the extent
permitted under the terms and conditions of Parent's applicable insurance
contracts in effect as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that for
purposes of clarity, to the extent such benefit coverage includes eligibility
conditions based on periods of employment, Section 7.17(a) shall control; and
(ii) provide each Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents with
credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid in the calendar year that, and
prior to the date that, such Continuing Employee commences participation in
such Parent Benefit Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment or deductible
requirements under such Parent Benefit Plan for the same calendar year, to the
extent that such expenses were recognized for such purposes under the
comparable Company Employee Plan.

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 7.17 are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties to
this Agreement and shall not create any right in any other Person, including
any employees, former employees, any participant in any Company Employee Plan
or any beneficiary thereof, of any right to continued employment with Parent,
Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates. Nothing in this
Section 7.17 shall be deemed to amend any Parent Benefit Plan or to require

prior written consent of Parent, the Company may

 enter into an agreement with such holder pursuant to which each warrant held
by such holder shall be cancelled and terminated in connection with the Merger
in exchange for the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest,
equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to each warrant held by such holder immediately prior to the

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

(i) the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or before October 27, 2016
(subject to possible extension as provided below, the "End Date"), provided,
that if the condition to the Offer set forth in clause (f) of Exhibit B shall
not have been satisfied by the End Date (as it may be extended as set forth
below), then (unless (A) there shall have been a material uncured breach of,
or a material uncured inaccuracy in, a covenant or representation or warranty
of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement, and (B) as a
result of such material uncured breach or inaccuracy, the Company has the
immediately exercisable right to validly terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(d) immediately prior to the scheduled End Date) Parent shall be
entitled to extend the End Date by a three (3) month period by written notice
to the Company (the End Date may be so extended not more than twice at the

this Agreement; provided, further, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose
material breach of any provisions of this Agreement results in the failure of

Order, decree, injunction or ruling or taken any other action permanently
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting the Offer or the consummation
of the Merger as contemplated by this Agreement and such Order, decree, ruling

(iii) the Offer shall have expired (without having been extended) or shall
have been terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including
Exhibit B) without Merger Subsidiary having accepted shares of Company Common
Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer; provided, however, that: (A) a party
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.01(b)(iii) if: (1) the failure of Merger Subsidiary to accept shares of
Company Common Stock for payment pursuant to the Offer is attributable to the
failure of an Offer Condition to be satisfied; and (2) the failure of such
Offer Condition to be satisfied is attributable to a failure, on the part of
the party seeking to terminate this Agreement, to perform any covenant in this
Agreement required to be performed by such party at or prior to the Acceptance
Time; and (B) the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 9.01(b)(iii) unless the Company shall have made any

materially breached any of its obligations under Section 7.02;

any Acquisition Proposal within ten (10) Business Days of the making public
thereof (including, for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to
the acceptance by the stockholders of the Company of a tender offer or
exchange offer, which shall constitute a failure to reject such Acquisition
Proposal) or (B) shall have failed, pursuant to Rule 14e-2 promulgated under
the Exchange Act or otherwise, to publicly reconfirm the Board Recommendation
within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a written request from Parent
that it do so if such request is made following the making by any Person of an
Acquisition Proposal (any of Section 9.01(c)(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), a
"Triggering Event"); or

(x) in the event (A) of a material breach of any covenant or agreement on the
part of the Company set forth in this Agreement such that the condition set
forth in clause (c) of Exhibit B would not be satisfied as of the time of such
breach or (B) that any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in
this Agreement shall have been inaccurate when made or shall have become
inaccurate, such that the condition set forth in clause (b) of Exhibit B would
not be satisfied as of the time of such breach or as of the time such
representation and warranty became inaccurate; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such breach by the Company or
such inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Company are
curable by the Company through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts
prior to the End Date and within thirty (30) calendar days, then Parent shall
not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
9.01(c)(v) until the earlier to occur of (1) the expiration of a thirty (30)
calendar day period after delivery of written notice from Parent to the
Company of such breach or inaccuracy, as applicable, or (2) the ceasing by the
Company to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such breach or
inaccuracy, provided that the Company continues to exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy (it being understood that
Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(c)(v) if
such breach or inaccuracy by the Company is cured within such thirty (30)
calendar day period); or

(d) by the Company:

(i) if prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board authorizes the Company,
in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 7.02(d), to
enter into a binding definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal
with a Third Party; provided that the Company shall have paid any amounts due
pursuant to Section 10.04 in accordance with the terms, and at the times,
specified therein; and provided further that in the event of such termination,
the Company substantially concurrently enters into such binding definitive
agreement; or

(ii) in the event (A) of a material breach of any covenant or agreement on the
part of Parent or Merger Subsidiary set forth in this Agreement and such
failure has a material adverse effect on Merger Subsidiary's ability to
purchase and pay for the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered (and
not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer or to consummate the Merger or (B) that
any of the representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Subsidiary set
forth in this Agreement shall have been inaccurate in any material respect and
such inaccuracy has a material adverse effect on Merger Subsidiary's ability
to purchase and pay for the shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered
(and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer or to consummate the Merger;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such
breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary or such inaccuracy in the
representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Subsidiary are curable by
Parent or Merger Subsidiary through the exercise of commercially reasonable
efforts prior to the End Date and within thirty (30) calendar days, then the
Company shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.01(d)(ii) until the earlier to occur of (1) the expiration of a
thirty (30) calendar day period after delivery of written notice from the
Company to Parent of such breach or inaccuracy, as applicable, or (2) Parent
or Merger Subsidiary ceasing to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
cure such breach or inaccuracy, provided that Parent or Merger

 Subsidiary continues to exercise commercially reasonable efforts to cure such
breach or inaccuracy (it being understood that the Company may not terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(d)(ii) if such breach or
inaccuracy by Parent or Merger Subsidiary is cured within such thirty (30)
calendar day period).

agent, consultant or other Representative of such party) to each other party
hereto; provided that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of
any liability for damages resulting from any willful or intentional breach of
this Agreement. The provisions of this Section 9.02 and Sections 10.04,
10.05(b), 10.06, 10.07 and 10.08 shall survive any termination hereof pursuant

and warranties contained herein and in any certificate or other writing
delivered pursuant hereto shall not survive the Effective Time.

Section 10.03. Amendments and Waivers.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the
Effective Time if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is
signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in
the case of a waiver, by each party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 10.04. Expenses.

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such cost
or expense; provided that the Company and Parent shall share equally all
filing fees payable pursuant to the HSR Act or any Foreign Competition Law.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(c)(i), Section
9.01(c)(ii), Section 9.01(c)(iii) or Section 9.01(c)(iv) (or if this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to any other provision of Section 9.01 at any time
after the occurrence of an event contemplated by any of Section 9.01(c)(i),
Section 9.01(c)(ii), Section 9.01(c)(iii) or Section 9.01(c)(iv)), then the
Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately available funds),
within two (2) Business Days after such termination, a fee in an amount equal
to $24,000,000 (the "Termination Fee"). If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.01(d)(i), then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire
transfer of immediately available funds), prior to and as a condition of such
termination, the Termination Fee.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(i) or Section
9.01(b)(iii) and, (i) prior to such termination, an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been publicly announced and not publicly withdrawn, and (ii) within
twelve (12) months following the date of such termination the Company shall
have (A) entered into a definitive agreement with respect to, (B) recommended
to its stockholders or (C) consummated, a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal (with all references to 15% in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal being treated as 50% for purposes of this clause (ii)),
then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of immediately
available funds), within two (2) Business Days after entering into such
definitive agreement, making such recommendation or consummating such
transaction, the Termination Fee.

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
9.01(b)(i) or Section 9.01(b)(iii), the Company shall as promptly as possible
(but in any event within three (3) Business Days) following receipt of an
invoice therefor pay all of the documented reasonable out-of-pocket fees and
expenses (including reasonable legal and other third party advisors fees and
expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the
termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, but in no event more than $5,000,000 (the "Parent
Expenses") as directed by Parent in writing; provided that the amount of any
payment of Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 10.04(d) shall be credited
against any obligation of the Company to pay the Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 10.04(c).

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
10.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that without these agreements, Parent and Merger Subsidiary would not
enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay any amount
due to Parent pursuant to this Section 10.04, when due, the Company shall pay
the costs and expenses

(including legal fees and expenses) in connection with any action taken to
collect payment (including the prosecution of any lawsuit or other legal
action), together with interest on the unpaid amount at the publicly announced
prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in New York City from the date such amount was
first payable to the date it is paid.

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Termination Fee contemplated by
this Section 10.04 shall be payable by the Company on only one occasion,
whether or not the facts or circumstances giving rise to the Company's
obligation to pay the Termination Fee may otherwise trigger an obligation to
pay the Termination Fee under more than one subsection of this Section 10.04
or on more than one occasion pursuant to the same subsection of this Section
10.04 (it being understood, however, that this Section 10.04(f) shall not be
interpreted to limit or restrict Parent's ability to seek or obtain any other
remedy it may have with respect to this Agreement).

Section 10.05. Binding Effect; No Third Party Beneficiaries; No Assignment.

(e) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and, except as
provided in Section 7.08, (which shall be to the benefit of the parties
referred to in such section), shall inure only to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Except as provided in
Section 7.08, no provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to create any third party beneficiaries.

(f) No party hereto may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its
rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the consent of each other party hereto, except that Parent
or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under
this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of their

its obligations hereunder. Any assignment, delegation or transfer in violation

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard

New Castle County, Delaware. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such court in respect of any Proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding,

Proceeding is improper or that this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party hereto agrees that
notice or the service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be properly

ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY.

Section 10.09. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until
and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by each other
party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any
right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written
agreement or other communication). Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in PDF form, or by any other
electronic means designed to preserve the original graphic and pictorial
appearance of a document, will be deemed to have the same effect as physical

Section 10.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the

Section 10.11. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties hereto agree to modify
this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner, in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

Section 10.12. Specific Performance. In the event of any breach or threatened
breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, on the one hand, or the Company, on the
other hand, of any covenant or obligation of such party contained in this
Agreement, the other party shall be entitled to seek, in addition to any
monetary remedy or damages: (a) a decree or order of specific performance to
enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation; and (b)
an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach.

the Company Disclosure Schedule shall only be deemed to be an exception to
(or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) (a) the representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained in
the corresponding Section of this Agreement and (b) any other representations
and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are contained
in this Agreement, but only if the relevance of that reference as an exception
to (or a disclosure for purposes of) would be reasonably apparent from such
item.

Section 10.14. Rules of Construction. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges
that it has been represented by counsel of its choice throughout all
negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement, and that it
has executed the same with the advice of said independent counsel. Each party
and its counsel cooperated and participated in the drafting and preparation of

relating thereto exchanged among the parties shall be deemed the work product

its drafting or preparation. Accordingly, any rule of law or any legal
decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this
Agreement against any party that drafted or prepared it is of no application
and is hereby expressly waived by each of the parties hereto, and any
controversy over interpretations of this Agreement shall be decided without
regards to events of drafting or preparation.
