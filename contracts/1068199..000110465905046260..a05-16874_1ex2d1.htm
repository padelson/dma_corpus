under any Personal Property Lease, and to the Knowledge of Seller no event
has occurred and no circumstance exists which, if not remedied, and whether
with or without notice or the passage of time or both, would result in such a
breach or default. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received or
given any written notice of any breach or default or event that with

  



  

8   

     
   

  



  

### notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by
the Company or any Subsidiary under any of the Personal Property Leases and,
to the Knowledge of Seller, none of the lessors under such Personal Property
Leases is in material breach or default thereof.  No lessor with respect to
a Personal Property Lease has notified the Company or any Subsidiary in
writing of the exercise of any termination rights with respect thereto.

#### (xvi) Contracts with Seller or any Affiliate thereof or any current or

#### 

  

### (b) Each of the Material Contracts is in full force and effect and is the

party thereto, and, to the Knowledge of Seller, of the other parties thereto,
enforceable against the Company and such Subsidiary and, to the Knowledge of
Seller, each of such other parties in accordance with its terms and, upon
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall,
except to the extent that any consents set forth in Schedule 3.4(a) are not
obtained or except as otherwise stated in Schedule 3.13(b), continue in full
force and effect without penalty or other adverse consequence, except as may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors rights in general and subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered
in a proceeding in equity or at law). Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is in material breach of or default under any Material Contract, nor, to the
Knowledge of Seller, is any other party to any Material Contract in material
breach of or material default thereunder, and no event has occurred that with

breach or material default by the Company, any Subsidiary or, to the
Knowledge of Seller, any other party thereunder. No party to any of the
Material Contracts has notified the Company or any Subsidiary in writing that
it intends to, or to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened to, amend any
Material Contract in any material respect or exercise any termination rights
with respect thereto. To the Knowledge of Seller (but without making any
inquiry of MBIA Insurance Corporation or BH Credit, LLC with respect to the
foregoing), there are no facts or circumstances that exist with regard to
CMS relationship with MBIA Insurance Corporation or BH Credit, LLC
which would form the basis for such clients to seek termination of their
servicing agreements with CMS disclosed on Schedule 3.4(a) by withholding
their consent (if required) with respect to the change of control
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. No party has given written
notice to the Company or any Subsidiary of any material dispute with respect
to any Material Contract.  The Company has made available to Buyer true,
correct and complete copies of all of the Material Contracts, together with
all amendments, modifications or supplements thereto.  (For clarity, it is
agreed that a breach or default by the Company or a Subsidiary of a Material
Contract that would entitle a counter-party to terminate such contract, or to
materially alter the economic benefits thereof to the detriment of the
Company or a Subsidiary, constitutes a material breach or default of such
Material Contract.)

Subsidiaries to, disclose to Buyer all opportunities any one of them wishes
to pursue for the purchase of a portfolio of credit card receivables or
credit card accounts at a price in excess of Ten Million
Dollars ($10,000,000). If Buyer declines to consent to waive any of the

Subsidiaries the option to participate (on the same terms as Buyer or its

  



  

30

earliest practicable date all consents, waivers and approvals from, and
provide all notices to, all Persons that are not a Governmental Body, which
consents, waivers, approvals and notices are required to consummate, or are
in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consents, waivers, approvals and notices under the
agreements required to be scheduled in Sections 3.4 and 4.3 hereof (except
for such matters covered by Section 5.1).  All such consents, waivers,
approvals and notices shall be in writing and in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and executed counterparts of such consents,
waivers and approvals shall be delivered to Buyer promptly after receipt
thereof, and copies of such notices shall be delivered to Buyer promptly
after the making thereof. Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause the Company
and the Subsidiaries to, consult and cooperate with each other and in good
faith to use commercially reasonable efforts in obtaining such
consents, waivers and approvals, and providing such notices.

  

## 

  

## 5.5 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, each of Seller and Buyer shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and in
connection with all obligations required to be performed under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, all amounts payable by the Company
under its Management Equity Return Bonus Plan shall be borne by the Company
and not by Seller, but all other out of pocket expenses of the Company and
its Subsidiaries incurred prior to the Closing attendant to the transaction
contemplated herein will be paid by Seller..

  

## 

  

## 5.6 _Access to Information_.  Prior to the Closing, Buyer and its

businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries as it may desire, and Seller
shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to give to Buyer and to its
counsel, accountants and other representatives, upon reasonable notice,
access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the
Closing to all of the assets, books, commitments, agreements, records and
files of the Company and the Subsidiaries, and Seller promptly shall furnish
to Buyer during that period all documents and copies of documents and
information concerning the business and affairs of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as Buyer reasonably may request. Without limiting the foregoing,
Seller shall provide to Buyer all material information that Seller, the
Company or the Subsidiaries receive or develop with respect to the
CardSystems Data Breach and the claims and liabilities resulting therefrom.
 The parties hereto acknowledge that the provisions of the
Nondisclosure Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the termination of this Agreement and shall cover all
information provided by the Seller, the Company, the Subsidiaries or their
representatives to Buyer or any of its representatives in connection with or
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Without limiting the provisions of
the Nondisclosure Agreement, which shall terminate upon the Closing of the
transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement, if, for any reason,
such

  



  

31   

     
   

  



  

## transactions are not consummated. Buyer agrees that it will not disclose
to any third party or use for its own benefit any confidential information
relating to the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their
businesses, which it may have acquired in the course of such examination and
investigation and that it will promptly return and cause its representatives
to return to the Company any property, books, records or papers relating to
the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses, and
any copies thereof which Buyer or its representatives may then have in their
possession. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement or the Nondisclosure Agreement, under no circumstances shall Buyer
directly or indirectly contact, prior to the closing, or, if this Agreement
terminates, for a period of two years after termination, any employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or any customer of, or supplier to, the Company
or its Subsidiaries with respect to any matter relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of Seller.

  

## 

  

## 5.7 _Employees; ERISA_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Buyer shall retain the right to cause the Company or any Subsidiary
to terminate or otherwise change the terms of the employment of any employee
of the Company or any Subsidiary at any time after the Closing. Buyer shall
cause the Company to pay to the senior management employees of the Company or
the Subsidiaries identified on Schedule 5.7(a) whose employment
is terminated by the Company or any Subsidiary without cause, or by the
employee with good reason, within eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date
severance in an amount equal to the base salary plus bonus (but excluding
payments made pursuant to the Management Equity Return Bonus Plan or any
other payments made as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein) paid to such employee for services performed during the
calendar year immediately preceding the date of termination subject to such
employee timely executing a general release of claims against the Company.

  

### 

  

### (b) For the eighteen (18) month period commencing on the Closing Date
Buyer shall provide all employees of the Company and the Subsidiaries
("Covered Employees") employee benefits that in the aggregate
are substantially comparable to the benefits provided by Buyer to
similarly situated employees, and Buyer shall give each of those Covered
Employees past service credit for purposes of eligibility and vesting under
all employee benefit plans for employees of Buyer at or after the Closing
(and past service credit for all purposes, including the amount of benefits,
under the severance, vacation, sick pay and similar policies of Buyer)
provided that crediting such service does not result in the duplication of
any benefits. Buyer may, however, make adjustments to such benefits as
reasonably necessary to comply with changes in the law.

  

### 

  

### (c) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide all Covered Employees
(and their dependents) with medical and dental benefit coverage under plan(s)
maintained or established by Buyer. Buyer shall cause its plan(s) to waive
any pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods (except to the
extent that such exclusions would have then applied or waiting periods were
not satisfied under the employees current company provided medical plan) and
to credit or otherwise consider any monies paid (or accrued) under the
Companys or a Subsidiarys medical plan by Covered Employees (or their
dependents) prior to the Closing Date toward any deductibles, co-pays or
other maximums under its plan(s) during the plan year which includes the
Closing Date. Buyer shall be responsible for satisfying its

  



  

32   

     
   

  



  

### obligations under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the
Code to provide continuation coverage (COBRA) to any Covered Employee in
accordance with law. Buyer shall provide COBRA coverage to any employees of
the Company and the Subsidiaries not employed by Buyer on the Closing Date
(and to any former employees of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries being
provided COBRA coverage by the Company and the Subsidiaries on the Closing
Date) to the extent required by COBRA.

  

### 

  

### (d) At the Closing, the Buyer shall cause the Company to adopt a
management incentive plan for the benefit of executive employees of the
Company and the Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (e) From and after the Closing, the Company shall comply with the terms
of the Companys Management Equity Return Bonus Plan resulting from the
consummation of the transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement.
Following the payment of all amounts to be paid thereunder, the Companys
Management Equity Return Bonus Plan shall be terminated.

  

### 

  

## 5.8 _Other Action_. No party to this Agreement shall take any action that
would result in any of its representations and warranties not being true as
of the Closing Date. Each of the parties to this Agreement shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the fulfillment at the earliest
practicable date of all of the conditions to the obligations of the parties
to consummate the transactions under this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 5.9 _Further Assurances_. At any time and from time to time after the
Closing, each of the parties shall, without further consideration, execute
and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered to the other parties such
additional instruments, and shall take such other action as the other parties
may request to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For
a period of three years (seven years in connection with any Tax matters)
after the Closing, each party shall grant the other parties reasonable access
during normal business hours upon reasonable prior notice to the books and
records of the parties for the purpose of complying with any applicable law
or governmental rule or request relating to the period during which the
other party owned the Company.

  

## 

  

## 5.10 _Directors and Officers Indemnification_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Buyer and Seller agree that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation now existing in favor of any employee, agent, director, officer,
shareholder, partner of a shareholder, member or partner of the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries (the "DandO Indemnified Parties"), as provided in their
respective organizational agreements and their respective indemnification
agreements, if any, shall survive the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
**** years after the Closing Date; provided that in the event any claim or
claims are asserted or made within such six **** year period, all rights
to indemnification in respect of any such claim shall continue until
final disposition of such claim. Buyer hereby agrees, effective as of the
Closing Date, to guarantee the Companys and its Subsidiaries
indemnification and exculpation obligations existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties, as provided in the Companys and its
Subsidiaries respective applicable organizational documents and their
respective indemnification agreements, if any, for the period of time set
forth under this Section 5.10(a).

  



  

33   

     
   

  



  

### (b) Buyer agrees from and after the Closing Date to cause the Company to
maintain the policies of director and officer liability insurance maintained
by the Company on the date hereof and listed in Schedule 5.10(b) to be
maintained in effect for the period of time directors and officers
are entitled to indemnification under Section 5.10(a) above; provided that
the Company may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous in
any material respect to the DandO Indemnified Parties, provided that such
substitution shall not result in any gaps or lapses in coverage with respect
to matters occurring prior to the Closing Date. On the Closing Date, Buyer
shall obtain, at Buyers or the Companys expense (and not the expense of the
Seller), a run-off policy of directors and officers liability insurance,
providing coverage for each individual who served as a director or officer of
the Company or its Subsidiaries at any time prior to the Closing, for a
period of six (6) years after the Closing; provided, however, that Buyer
shall not be obligated to pay in excess of $600,000 for such coverage but
will obtain a policy with as much coverage as is available for a cost not
exceeding such amount.  Each current officer and director of the Company and
the Subsidiaries shall have rights as a third party beneficiary under this
Section 5.10 as separate contractual rights for his or her benefit.

  

### 

  

### (c) In the event the Company or any of its Subsidiaries merges or is
acquired in a transaction in which it is not the surviving corporation, or if
Buyer sells substantially all of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, Buyer shall cause proper provision to be made in such
transaction so that the Companys or any Subsidiarys successor or acquirer
will assume the obligations set forth in Sections 5.10(a) and (b) above.
Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the parties agree that
the DandO Indemnified Parties are third party beneficiaries of, and entitled to
enforce, the provisions of this Section 5.10.

  

### 

  

## 5.11 _Tax Matters_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) Seller shall cause the Company and Subsidiaries to timely file
(including extensions) all Tax Returns required to be filed by them on or
prior to the Closing Date and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown
due thereon. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with prior practice unless otherwise required by law; provided that the
income Tax Return of Merrick Bank for the taxable year ended December 31,
2004, may modify past practice regarding determination of the Utah receipts
factor if such modification is not reasonably anticipated to increase the Tax
liability of Merrick Bank for taxable periods after the Closing Date. Seller
shall provide Buyer with copies of such completed Tax Returns on the due date
for filing thereof (including extensions).

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Following the closing, Buyer shall cause to be timely filed all Tax
Returns required to be filed by the Company and the Subsidiaries after the
Closing Date for taxable periods (or portions thereof) ending on the Closing
Date and pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon; _provided_ ,
that (A) such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner that is consistent
with the past practices and positions of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
(B) such Tax Returns shall be provided to Seller in draft form for review no
later than 15 Business Days before filing, (C) within 5 Business Days

  



  

34   

     
   

  



  

#### of receiving such Tax Returns Seller shall have an opportunity to object
to any positions taken on such Tax Returns that could reasonably be likely to
impact in any material respect Sellers indemnification obligation, (D)
if Seller so objects then the parties shall reasonably consult as to
such positions, and (E) if Seller and Buyer cannot agree on the proper
manner for reporting with respect to such positions, then Sellers position
shall be reflected on such Tax Returns as filed unless prior to filing Buyer
provides Seller with a written opinion of its tax counsel or accountants
confirming that there is no reasonable basis under then current law for such
Tax positions on such Tax Returns.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Buyer shall not file, or cause to be filed, any amended Tax Return
for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period or
portion thereof ending on or before the Closing Date without the written
consent of Seller, which consent Seller shall not unreasonably withhold or
delay, if the likely effect of such amended Tax Return would be to increase
the Sellers indemnification obligation. Without limiting Sellers right to
withhold its consent reasonably, Seller will be deemed to have reasonably
withheld its consent to the filing of any amended Tax Return if it provides
Buyer a written opinion that there was substantial authority for the
positions taken on the Tax Return that Buyer is seeking to amend.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) To the extent that the Seller has an indemnification obligation
under Section 8.2(a) with respect to taxes reflected on Tax Returns which
Buyer shall cause to be filed, Buyer shall not grant an extension of any
applicable statute of limitations for assessment or collection of Taxes,
without the Sellers consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

  

#### 

  

### (b) _Transfer Taxes_. The Seller shall be liable for 50 percent and the
Buyer shall be liable for 50 percent and they together shall pay, and Seller
shall file all necessary Tax Returns with respect to, all sales, use, stamp,
documentary, filing, recording, transfer or similar fees or Taxes or
governmental charges as levied by any Governmental Body, including any
interest and penalties in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Timing Differences_. In the event of any increase in Taxes for
any reason in any taxable period of the Company or any Subsidiary resulting
from a Timing Adjustment, which increase is subject to indemnification by
Seller under Section 8.2(a), such indemnification obligation of Seller shall
be reduced by the amount of any Tax savings realized by Buyer, the Company or
any Subsidiary as a result of such Timing Adjustment. For purposes of this
Section 5.11(c), a Timing Adjustment shall mean any shift of income,
deduction or credit between one taxable period and another taxable period
which causes an increase in Taxes in the one taxable period and a decrease in
Taxes in the other taxable period or results in a Tax benefit in such other
taxable period that may be carried to a different taxable period or periods.
 For this purpose, a Tax Return of the Company or any Subsidiary filed
by Buyer for a taxable period beginning after December 31, 2004 and ending
on or before the Closing Date which is not consistent with the past practices
and positions of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be considered to
result in a Timing Adjustment to the extent that (i) income or deductions
that would have been reported on such Tax Return in accordance with the past
practices and positions of the Company and its Subsidiaries are shifted to a
different taxable period, or (ii) income or deductions that would have been
reported in a different taxable period in accordance with the past practices
and positions of

  



  

35   

     
   

  



  

### the Company and its Subsidiaries are shifted to the taxable period
reported on such Tax Return.  The amount of Tax savings realized shall be
equal to the excess of (x) the amount of Taxes that would have been payable
in the absence of the Timing Adjustment in the taxable period to which the
adjustment is made or any other taxable periods in which a Tax benefit
resulting from such adjustment may be recognized over (y) the amount of Taxes
actually paid in such taxable period or periods. This Section 5.11(c)
shall not be interpreted, in conjunction with Section 8, to allow an
indemnified party to be indemnified more than once for the same loss, cost or
expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be indemnified for any
time value of money loss for a taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date associated with income acceleration or deduction deferral Timing
Adjustments based on the large corporation IRS underpayment rate of interest
in effect on the Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Tax Audits_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) If notice of any Legal Proceeding with respect to Taxes of the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries (a "Tax Claim") shall be received by any
party for which any other party may reasonably be expected to be liable
pursuant to Section 8.2, the notified party shall notify such other party in
writing of such Tax Claim; provided, however, that the failure of the
notified party to give such other party notice as provided herein shall not
relieve such other party of its obligations under Section 8.2 except to the
extent that such other party is actually and materially prejudiced thereby.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Seller shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution
of any Tax Claim that is subject to indemnification by Seller pursuant to
Section 8.2, unless such resolution would likely have a material increase in
liabilities for Taxes of, or attributable to, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in a taxable period ending after the Closing Date and Seller
would not be required to indemnify Buyer fully for such increase. Seller
shall afford Buyer the opportunity to control jointly the conduct and
resolution of the portion of such Tax Claim that would likely have a material
increase in the liabilities for Taxes of, or attributable to, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in taxable periods ending after the Closing Date
without indemnification for such increase by Seller. If Buyer shall decline
in writing to participate in the joint control of the conduct of such Tax
Claim, or shall fail to actively participate in such audit in a
manner reasonably satisfactory to Seller, Seller shall have the right to
control the conduct of such Tax Claim, provided that Seller shall not resolve
such Tax Claim without Buyers written consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

  

#### 

  

If Seller shall elect in writing not to control or participate in the control
of the conduct of a Tax Claim described in Section 5.11(d)(ii), or shall
fail to actively participate in such audit in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, Buyer shall have the right to control the conduct of
such Tax Claim, provided that Buyer shall keep Seller informed of all
developments and Buyer shall not resolve such Tax Claim without Sellers
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  



  

36   

     
   

  



  

### (e) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) On or before the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the Company to
provide to Buyer a schedule which sets forth the following information with
respect to each of the Company and the Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2004:
(A) the basis of the Company and its Subsidiaries in its assets; (B)the
amount of any net operating loss, net capital loss, unused investment or

request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Company
and the Subsidiaries and Seller agree (A) to retain all books and records

and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing
authority, and (B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the

case may be, shall allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records.

other party with all information that either party may be required to report
pursuant to Section 6043 of the Code and all Treasury Regulations
promulgated thereunder.

### (f) _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_.  Seller and Buyer agree to
treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to Section 8.2 as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for all income tax purposes. If, notwithstanding the
treatment required by the preceding sentence, any indemnification payment
under Section 8.2 is determined to be taxable to the party receiving such
payment by any Taxing Authority, the paying party shall also indemnify the
party receiving such payment for any Taxes incurred by reason of the receipt
of such payment and any losses incurred by the party receiving such payment
in connection with such Taxes (or any asserted deficiency, claim, demand,
action, suit, proceeding, judgment or assessment, including the defense or
settlement thereof, relating to such Taxes). Notwithstanding the foregoing,

as a result of its failure

Company or any of the Subsidiaries or for access to the properties, books or
records of the Company or any Subsidiary by any Person other than Buyer. Such

cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or negotiations
with any Persons (other than Buyer) conducted heretofore with respect to any

## 5.13 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality_.

  

## 

  

### (a) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
own, manage, engage in, operate, control, work for, consult with, render
services for, do business with, maintain any interest in (proprietary,

contained in this Section 5.13 shall not restrict the acquisition by Seller
or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, of less than 5% of the
outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded company engaged in a
Restricted Business **;** and, provided, further, that the restrictions
contained in this Section 5.13 shall not restrict any Affiliate of Seller
engaged in a Restricted Business as of the date of this Agreement and listed
on Schedule 5.13(a) from continuing to engage in such Restricted Business.

  

### 

  

### (b) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly: (i)
cause, solicit, induce or encourage any employees of the Company or the
Subsidiaries to leave such employment or hire, employ or otherwise engage any
such individual or (ii) cause, induce or encourage any client, customer,
supplier, or licensor of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries (including
any existing or former customer of the Company or the Subsidiaries or any
other Person who has a material business relationship with the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries), to terminate or modify any such actual relationship;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall limit the right of Seller or its
Affiliates to (A) solicit services of Persons through general advertisements
in public or other media that are not specifically directed to or targeted at
the Company or the Subsidiaries or (B) retain the services of a search firm
to solicit services of employees, provided that such search firm shall have
been instructed not to contact any employees of the Company or the
Subsidiaries.

  

### 

  

### (c) For a period of two (2) years from and after the Closing Date, Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,

Affiliates, investors and potential investors. Seller shall not have any
obligation to keep confidential (or cause its Affiliates to keep

requirement prior to making any disclosure so that Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order.

  

###

to matters which are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a
violation of any of the

  



  

39   

     
   

  



  

### terms of this Section 5.13 will cause irreparable injury to Buyer, the
amount of which will be impossible to estimate or determine and which cannot
be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for any breach of
this Section 5.13 will be inadequate. Therefore, Buyer will be entitled to
obtain a temporary and permanent injunction, restraining order or other
equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in the event of any
breach of this Section 5.13 without the necessity of proving actual damage or
posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies provided by this
Section 5.13 are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies
which Buyer may have hereunder or at law or in equity. In the event that Buyer
were to seek damages for any breach of this Section 5.13, the portion of the
consideration delivered to Seller hereunder which is allocated by the parties
to the foregoing covenant shall not be considered a measure of or limit on
such damages.

6.1 or Section 8.2, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has made its
own inquiry of and investigation into, and has completed its own analysis and
evaluation of, the Company and the Subsidiaries, and based thereon has formed
an independent judgment concerning the Company and the Subsidiaries, and (ii)
has made all such reviews and inspections of the financial condition,
business, results of operations, properties, assets and prospects of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as it deemed necessary or appropriate.

  

### 

  

### (c) Without limiting the representations and warranties contained in
Section 4 hereof or in any way limiting Sellers rights set forth in Section
6.2 and Section 8.2, Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyers parent,
CompuCredit Corporation, is a publicly traded company and that Seller has had
access to all information available to the public concerning CompuCredit
Corporation and made such investigations as it has deemed necessary.

agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing Date, but no party shall be liable to the other for
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty, covenant or other agreement except
to the extent that notice of a claim is asserted in writing and delivered to
it at any time prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the day of the 18th

Date, except with respect to (i) a misrepresentation or breach of warranty

## 

  

## 8.2 _Indemnification_.

  

## 

  

### (a) Subject to the provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5, Seller

(collectively, the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against all claims,
loss, liability, damage, penalty, cost and expense (including reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel)

  



  

43   

     
   

  



  

### (collectively, "Losses") that such Buyer Indemnified Party may suffer,
sustain or become subject to, arising from or as a result of any
misrepresentation by Seller in this Agreement or any breach by Seller of any
warranty or covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement
(unless expressly waived in writing by Buyer); provided, however, that with
respect to any misrepresentation or breach of any warranty, covenant or other
agreement in this Agreement by Seller, **** in each case solely with respect
to the indemnification obligations in this Section 8.2(a) determined without
regard to any qualification contained in any such representation, warranty or
covenant as to materiality or Material Adverse Effect; and further provided,
that Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party
for Taxes arising in the Ordinary Course of Business during the period after
June 30, 2005 as a result of the operation of the business after June 30,
2005 and ending on the Closing Date and, except as provided in the last
sentence of Section 5.11(c), Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any
Buyer Indemnified Party for Losses resulting from the failure of any
representation or warranty contained in Section 3.12 to be true and correct
for taxable periods or portions thereof beginning after the Closing Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that (i) any Taxes resulting from
Merrick Banks Section 481 adjustment in accordance with Section 585 of the
Code with respect to taxable periods beginning after December 31, 2004 shall
be regarded as Taxes arising in the Ordinary Course of Business for the
period after June 30, 2005 as a result of the operation of the business after
June 30, 2005, and (ii) the assessment of interest and penalties would not
constitute Ordinary Course of Business.

  

### 

  

### (b) Subject to the provisions of Section 8.1, 8.3, 8.4, and 8.5, Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and
against 50% of all CSSI Losses in excess of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000)

indemnification obligations shall apply equally to CSSI Losses whether
incurred before or after the Closing.

  

### 

  

### (c) Subject to the provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.3, 8.4 and 8.5, Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its officers, directors and
Affiliates (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified Parties") from and against
all Losses that such Seller Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain or become
subject to arising from or as a result of any misrepresentation by Buyer in
this Agreement or any breach by Buyer of any warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement (unless expressly waived in writing by
Seller), provided, however that with respect to any misrepresentation or
breach of any warranty, covenant or other agreement in this Agreement by
Buyer, in each case solely with respect to the indemnification obligations in
this Section 8.2(c) determined without regard to any qualification contained
in any such representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement as to
materiality or material adverse effect.

  

### 

  

## 8.3 _Defense of Claims_.

  

## 

  

### (a) If any third party claim or investigation is made against either
party that, if sustained, would give rise to a liability of the other party
for indemnification under this Agreement (the "Indemnifying Party"), the
party against whom the claim is made (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly
cause notice of the claim to be delivered to the Indemnifying Party;
provided, however, that, subject to Section 8.1, the failure to so notify the

  



  

44   

     
   

  



  

### Indemnifying Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability
hereunder with respect to such claim only if, and only to the extent that,
such failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party results in the forfeiture by
the Indemnifying Party of rights and defenses otherwise available to it with
respect to such claim.  The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon
written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) days
thereafter, to acknowledge that any Losses or CSSI Losses resulting from such
claim or investigation are indemnifiable Losses or CSSI Losses, as
applicable, of the Indemnified Party under Section 8.2, subject to the other
provision of this Article 8, and to assume the defense of such claim,
including the employment of counsel and the payment of the fees and
disbursements of such counsel. In the event, however, that the Indemnifying
Party declines or fails to assume the defense of the claim or investigation
within such twenty (20) day period on the terms provided above, or
subsequently ceases to actually provide such defense, then the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel
for the Indemnified Party as incurred. In any claim or investigation for
which indemnification is being sought the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, whichever is not assuming the defense of such action,
shall have **** the right to participate in such matter and to retain its own
counsel at such partys own expense. The Indemnifying Party or
the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, shall at all times use
reasonable efforts to keep the other party reasonably apprised of the status
of the defense of any matter and shall cooperate in good faith with each
other with respect to the defense of any such matter **.**

  

### 

  

### (b) No Indemnifying Party may, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought hereunder
unless (i) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party and its officers, directors, employees and
Affiliates from all liability arising out of such claim, (ii) does not
contain any admission or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on
behalf of the Indemnified Party and (iii) does not contain any equitable
order, judgment or term that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes
with the business of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified Partys
Affiliates. An Indemnified Party may not, without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party, settle or compromise any claim or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to which indemnification is being sought
hereunder unless (x) such settlement, compromise or consent is paid by the
Indemnified Party and includes an unconditional release of the Indemnifying
Party and its officers, directors, employees and affiliates from all
liability arising out of such claim, (y) does not contain any admission or
statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf of the
Indemnifying Party and (z) does not contain any equitable order, judgment or
term that in any manner affects, restrains or interferes with the business of
the Indemnifying Party or any of the Indemnifying Partys Affiliates.

in this Agreement:

  

## 

  

### (a)

  

### 

  

#### (i) Seller shall not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified Party for any
indemnification obligation under Section 8.2(a) unless and until the sum of

45   

     
   

  



  

#### Parties that are subject to indemnification under Section 8.2(a), plus

#### 

  

#### (ii) Buyer shall not be liable to any Seller Indemnified Party for any
indemnification obligation under Section 8.2(c) unless and until the sum of

by all Seller Indemnified Parties that are subject to indemnification under
Section 8.2(c), plus (y) 50% of CSSI Losses in excess of Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000), exceeds $2.7 million, and then only to the extent of such
excess.

  

#### 

  

### (b) In calculating the amount of Losses and CSSI Losses for which an
Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify any Indemnified Party hereunder:

  

### 

  

#### (i) the Indemnifying Party shall receive credit for any reduction in the
Indemnified Partys Tax liability, any recovery by the Indemnified Party from
any third party (other than insurance proceeds), any insurance proceeds with
respect to CSSI Losses, and, to the extent that Buyer in its sole discretion
determines to assert a claim therefor, other insurance proceeds as a result
of the facts or circumstances giving rise to the Losses (in the case of
insurance proceeds, net of collection costs), and

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) no amount shall be included except for actual and incidental
damages (e.g., actual out-of-pocket expenses) and shall expressly not include
any lost profits or consequential damages; provided however, that such
Indemnified Party shall have the right to recover the diminution in value of
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  

#### 

  

### (c) Each party hereto claiming indemnification under this Section 8 shall
be responsible for taking or causing to be taken all reasonable steps to
mitigate its Losses and CSSI Losses, as applicable, upon and after becoming
aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses
and CSSI Losses that may be indemnifiable under this Section 8, subject to
the limitations contained in Section 8.4(b) with respect to the filing of
insurance claims.

  

### 

  

### (d) Any indemnification payment made hereunder shall be treated by Seller
and Buyer, to the greatest extent allowed by applicable law, as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price.

  

### 

  

### (e) No breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein shall give rise to any right on the part
of either Buyer or Seller, after the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

  

### 

  

(f) Expected recoveries from third parties and insurance proceeds shall not
be taken into account until actually received at which time they shall be
distributed to Seller and Buyer in order to yield the same results as if they
had been received immediately prior to the indemnification payment.

Exhibits, contains a complete statement of all the arrangements among the
parties with respect to its subject matter, supersedes any previous
agreements between them relating to that subject matter (other than the

in full force and effect except as expressly modified by this Agreement) and
cannot be changed or terminated orally but only by an instrument in writing
signed by the parties hereto. Except as specifically set forth in
this Agreement, there are no representations or warranties by any party
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 10.3 _Headings; Construction_. The Section headings of this Agreement are
for reference purposes only and are to be given no effect in the construction
or interpretation of this Agreement. All references to "Section" or
"Sections" refer to the corresponding Section or Sections of this Agreement.
All words used in this Agreement shall be construed to be of such gender or
number as the circumstances require. Unless otherwise expressly provided, the
word "including" does not limit the preceding words or terms. The Exhibits
attached hereto and Schedules referred to herein and attached hereto are
hereby incorporated herein and made a part hereof as if fully set forth
herein.  Disclosure of any fact or item in any Schedule shall, should
the existence of the fact or item be relevant to any other Schedule, be
deemed to be disclosed with respect to that other Schedule if the
applicability thereof is reasonably apparent. The parties hereto acknowledge
that certain matters set forth in each Schedule are included for
informational purposes only, notwithstanding the fact that, because they do
not rise above applicable materiality thresholds or otherwise, they would not
be required to be set forth therein by the terms of this Agreement and that
disclosure of such matters shall not be taken as an admission by the party
delivering such Schedule that such disclosure is required to be made under
the terms of any provision of this Agreement and in no event shall any such
disclosure be deemed or

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

## interpreted to broaden or otherwise amplify the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 10.4 _Governing Law_.  This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the law of the State of New York applicable to agreements
made and to be performed in New York without reference to its choice of law
rules.

## 10.5 _Separability_.  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or
unenforceable, the balance of this Agreement shall remain in effect.

  

## 

  

## 10.6 _Waiver_. Any party may waive compliance by any other party with any
provision of this Agreement. No waiver of any provision shall be construed

York, the State Court of the State of Georgia, and the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Georgia shall have exclusive jurisdiction
over the parties with respect to any dispute or controversy among them
arising under or in connection with this Agreement and, by execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement submits to

on the grounds of venue or forum non conveniens, the absence of in personam
or subject matter jurisdiction and any similar grounds, consents to service
of process by mail (in accordance with Section 10.1) or any other manner
permitted by law, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered
thereby in connection with this Agreement. These consents to jurisdiction
shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties to
this Agreement. SELLER AND BUYER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
ACTIONS OF SELLER OR BUYER OR THEIR RESPECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE
NEGOTIATION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF.

## 10.10 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as set forth in Section
5.10, this Agreement does not create, and shall not be construed as creating,
any rights in favor of any Person not a party to this Agreement.

  

## 

  

## 10.11 _Severability_.  Any provision hereof that is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the
extent permitted by law, each party hereby waives any provision of law that
renders any such provision prohibited or unenforceable in any respect.
