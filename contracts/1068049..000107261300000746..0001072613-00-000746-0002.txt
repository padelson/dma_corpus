one share of  common stock of the Sub Two Surviving Corporation with the same
rights,  powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute  the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Sub Two
Surviving  Corporation (the "SUB TWO SURVIVING SHARES"); and   (iii) each
Insilco Sub Two Share outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time
shall be converted into the right to receive an  amount of cash to be
determined on or prior to the Closing Date  (subject to adjustment as set
forth in Section 4.09), without interest  (the "SUB TWO MERGER
CONSIDERATION").   (c) Pursuant to the Sub Three Merger:   (i) each Merger
Sub Three Share held by Merger Sub Three as  treasury stock or owned by Buyer
or any subsidiary of Buyer immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be  made with respect thereto;   (ii) each
Insilco Sub Three Share outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one share of  common stock of the Sub
Three Surviving Corporation with the same  rights, powers and privileges and
shall constitute the only outstanding  shares of capital stock of the Sub
Three Surviving Corporation; and   12    (iii) on the Closing Dates, each
Sub Three Surviving Share  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be exchanged  for an amount of cash to be determined on the
Closing Date (subject to  adjustment as set forth in Section 4.09), without
interest, (the "SUB  THREE MERGER CONSIDERATION" and, together with the Sub
One Merger  Consideration and the Sub Two Merger Consideration, the "MERGER 
CONSIDERATION"). The Merger Consideration shall be subject to  adjustment as
provided in Section 4.09.   SECTION 2.04. DELIVERY AND PAYMENT. (a) On the
Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall mutually agree on the Merger
Consideration. Each holder of Sub One Surviving Shares and Sub Three
Surviving Shares who delivers such shares to the holder of the Merger Sub One
Shares and Merger Sub Three Shares will be entitled to receive the applicable
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Sub One Surviving Shares and
Sub Three Surviving Shares. Each holder of Insilco Sub Two Shares that have
been converted into a right to receive the Sub Two Merger Consideration, upon
surrender to the Sub Two Surviving Corporation of a certificate or
certificates representing such Sub Two Surviving Corporation Shares, will be
entitled to receive the Sub Two Merger Consideration payable in respect of
such Insilco Sub Two Shares. Until so surrendered, each such certificate
shall, after the Effective Time, represent for all purposes, only the right
to receive such Merger Consideration. The Insilco Sub One Shares, the Insilco
Sub Two Shares and the Insilco Sub Three Shares are hereafter referred to as
the Pre-Merger Shares.   (b) No portion of the Merger Consideration will be
paid to a Person other than Seller or the registered holder of the Pre-Merger
Shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor.   (c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Pre-Merger Shares. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates representing Pre-Merger Shares are presented to the Sub One
Surviving Corporation, the Sub Two Surviving Corporation or ThermaSys, as the
case may be, such Pre-Merger Shares shall be canceled and exchanged for the
consideration provided for in this Article 2.   SECTION 2.05. ASSET SALE
TREATMENT OF MERGER FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. The parties agree to
treat Sub Two Merger as (i) an acquisition of the assets of Insilco Sub Two
by Merger Sub Two, (ii) followed by a liquidation of Insilco Sub Two into
Insilco. The parties also agree that for federal income tax purposes and any
corresponding or analogous provisions of state and local tax law, any gain or
loss with respect to such asset acquisition will be taken into account as of
the last day that Insilco Sub Two is a member of Seller\'s group and will be
included in any consolidated or combined tax returns of Seller for the tax
period that includes the Closing Date.   13   ARTICLE 3  THE SURVIVING

certificates of incorporation of Insilco Sub One, Merger Sub Two and Insilco
Sub Three in effect at the Effective Time shall be the certificates of
incorporation of the Sub One Surviving Corporation, the Sub Two Surviving
Corporation and the Sub Three Surviving Corporation, respectively, until
amended in accordance with applicable law.   SECTION 3.02. BYLAWS. The
bylaws of Insilco Sub One, Merger Sub Two and Insilco Sub Three in effect at
the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Sub One Surviving Corporation,
the Sub Two Surviving Corporation and the Sub Three Surviving Corporation,
respectively, until amended in accordance with applicable law.   SECTION
3.03. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. From and after the Effective Time, until
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with

shall be the directors of the Sub One Surviving Corporation, and the officers
of the Insilco Sub One at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Sub
One Surviving Corporation;   (b) the directors of Insilco Sub Two at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Sub Two Surviving Corporation,

Insilco Sub Three at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Sub
Three Surviving Corporation and the officers of Insilco Sub Three at the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Sub Three

subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Buyer agrees, effective at the
time of the Closing, to assume (and thereafter to pay, perform and discharge,
as and when the same shall become due and payable) the following obligations
and liabilities (the "ASSUMED LIABILITIES"):   17    (a) all obligations
and liabilities set forth on the Balance  Sheet relating to the Thermal
Divisions;   (b) all liabilities and obligations of Insilco arising under
the  Contracts; and   (c) all Losses and obligations arising primarily out
of the  conduct of the Business (including, for purposes of the definition
of  Assumed Liabilities only, the previously divested business units known 
as "Romac" and "McKenica" or any one or more subsidiaries through which  such
business units may have operated) or the ownership, operation or  possession
of the Purchased Assets, including, without limitation, (i)  all Losses and
obligations arising under any Environmental Law in each  case arising
primarily out of the conduct of the Business, including,  but not limited to,
any liability for the treatment, transportation,  disposal or release of any
hazardous substances, as each of those terms  is defined under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation  and Liability Act, and
specifically including, without limitation, all  Losses and obligations
associated with the environmental matters  described on Schedule 4.03(c)(i)
attached hereto, (ii) all Losses and  obligations associated with both
asserted and unasserted claims and  causes of action arising out of the
conduct of the Business, including,  without limitation, those claims, causes
of action and similar matters  described on Schedule 4.03(c)(ii) attached
hereto, (iii) all Losses and  obligations arising primarily from product
liability and product  warranty claims in respect of sales of products by the
Business or any  predecessor thereto and (iv) all Losses arising on or after
the Closing  Date from the operation, maintenance, or termination of the
pension  plan assumed by the Buyer pursuant to Section 10.03(c) and all 
liabilities assumed by Buyer pursuant to Sections 10.03 and 10.04.   SECTION
4.04. EXCLUDED LIABILITIES. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
or any other writing to the contrary, Buyer is assuming only the Assumed
Liabilities and is not assuming any other liability or obligation of Insilco
(or any predecessor of Insilco or any prior owner of all or part of
its businesses and assets) of whatever nature, whether presently in existence
or arising hereafter. All such other liabilities and obligations shall be
retained by and remain obligations and liabilities of Insilco (all such
liabilities and obligations not being assumed being herein referred to as the
"EXCLUDED LIABILITIES"), and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 4.04, none of the following shall be Assumed Liabilities for the
purposes of this Agreement:   18    (a) any liability or obligation of
Insilco, or any member of any  consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary
group of which Insilco is  or has been a member, for Taxes (other than (i)
Taxes of Insilco Sub  One, Insilco Sub Three, TCI, Arup and Dalian for any
Post-Closing Tax  Period (ii) any Tax liability to the extent reflected in
the Final  Working Capital or (iii) for which Seller is not liable under
Section  9.06(b) or as otherwise expressly set forth herein); PROVIDED that 
Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement and Apportioned Obligations shall be  paid in the manner set
forth in Section 9.06(c) hereof;   (b) except to the extent provided in
Sections 10.02, 10.03 and  10.04, any liability or obligation relating to
employee benefits or  compensation arrangements existing on or prior to the
Closing Date,  including, without limitation, any liability or obligation
under any of  Seller\'s employee benefit agreements, plans or other
arrangements; and   (c) any liability or obligation relating primarily to an
Excluded  Asset.  Notwithstanding the foregoing clause (c), the fact that a
Purchased Asset is sold between the date hereof, and the Closing Date (and
therefore becomes an Excluded Asset pursuant to Section 4.02(d)), shall not
cause any product liability or warranty claim described in Section
4.03(c)(iii) arising from such sale to become an Excluded Liability.  
SECTION 4.05. ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACTS AND RIGHTS. Anything in this Agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement shall not constitute an
agreement to assign any Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any
benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom if such assignment, without
the consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach or
other contravention of such Purchased Asset or in any way materially
adversely affect the rights of ThermaSys or Insilco thereunder. Insilco and
ThermaSys will use their reasonable best efforts (but without any payment of
money by Insilco or ThermaSys) to obtain the consent of the other parties to
any such Purchased Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising
thereunder for the assignment thereof to ThermaSys as ThermaSys may
reasonably request. If such consent is not obtained, or if an attempted
assignment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights
of Insilco thereunder so that ThermaSys would not in fact receive all such
rights, Insilco and ThermaSys will cooperate in a mutually agreeable
arrangement under which ThermaSys would obtain the benefits and assume the
obligations thereunder in accordance with this Agreement, including sub-
contracting, sub-licensing, or sub-leasing to ThermaSys, or under
which Insilco would enforce   19   for the benefit of ThermaSys, with
ThermaSys assuming Insilco\'s obligations, any and all rights of Insilco
against a third party thereto. Insilco will promptly pay to ThermaSys when
received all monies received by Insilco under any Purchased Asset or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder, except to the extent the
same represents an Excluded Asset. In such event, Insilco and ThermaSys
shall, to the extent the benefits therefrom and obligations thereunder have
not been provided by alternate arrangements reasonably satisfactory
to ThermaSys and Insilco, negotiate in good faith an adjustment in
the consideration paid by ThermaSys for the Purchased Assets, to the extent
not otherwise adjusted pursuant to Section 4.09.   SECTION 4.06. ASSET
PURCHASE CONSIDERATION; ALLOCATION OF TRANSACTION CONSIDERATION. (a) On the
Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall agree on an allocation statement (the
"TRANSACTION CONSIDERATION ALLOCATION STATEMENT") allocating the Transaction
Consideration among Insilco Sub One, Insilco Sub Two, Insilco Sub Three, the
stock of each of Arup, Dalian and TCI and the portion of aggregate Purchased
Assets held by the Thermal Divisions (each an "ALLOCATION TARGET"). As soon
as practicable after the Closing, Buyer shall provide Seller with an
allocation statement (the "ASSET ALLOCATION STATEMENT"), allocating (i) the
portion of the Transaction Consideration allocated to the Purchased
Assets (the "ASSET PURCHASE CONSIDERATION") (plus Assumed Liabilities, to the
extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of the Code) among the
Purchased Assets held by the Thermal Divisions and (ii) the Sub Two Merger
Consideration (plus liabilities of Insilco Sub Two assumed by operation of
law, to the extent properly taken into account under Section 1060 of the
Code) among the assets of Insilco Sub Two. Seller shall accept the Asset
Allocation Statement unless the allocation therein is unreasonable in which
case, Seller shall notify Buyer within 30 days of its receipt of the Asset
Allocation Statement and the manner in which Seller would modify the
allocation to make it reasonable. If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on
the allocation within 15 days, the matter shall be referred to an Independent
Accountant. The Independent Accountant\'s determination of which party\'s
allocation is more reasonable shall be conclusive.   (b) Seller and Buyer
agree to be bound by the Asset Allocation Statement and the Transaction
Consideration Allocation Statement, and act in accordance with such
allocation statements in the preparation, filing and audit of any Tax return
(including, without limitation, filing Form 8594 with its federal income Tax
return for the taxable year that includes the date of the Closing).   (c)
If an adjustment is made with respect to the Transaction Consideration
pursuant to Section 4.09, the Transaction Consideration Allocation Statement
and Asset Allocation Statement shall be adjusted in accordance with  
20   Section 1060 of the Code and as mutually agreed by the Buyer and
Seller. Buyer and Seller agree to file any additional information return
required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code and to treat the
Transaction Consideration Allocation Statement and Asset Allocation Statement
as adjusted in the manner described in Section 4.06(c).   (d) Not later
than 30 days prior to the filing of their respective Forms 8594 relating to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each party shall deliver to
the other party a copy of its Form 8594.   SECTION 4.07. CLOSING. The
closing (the "CLOSING") of the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets and
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities hereunder and the Mergers shall
take place at the offices of Davis Polk and Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New
York, New York, as soon as possible, but in no event later than 10 business
days, after satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article 11, or at
such other time or place as Buyer and Seller may agree. At the Closing:  
(a) The Mergers shall have occurred and the Buyer shall have  delivered to
Seller the Merger Consideration in immediately available  funds by wire
transfer to an account of Seller with a bank designated  by Seller, by notice
to Buyer, on the Closing Date (or if not so  designated, then by certified or
official bank check payable in  immediately available funds to the order of
Seller in such amount).   (b) Buyer shall deliver to Seller the Transaction
Consideration  (less the Merger Consideration) in immediately available funds
by wire  transfer to an account of Seller with a bank designated by Seller,
by  notice to Buyer, on the Closing Date (or if not so designated, then by 
certified or official bank check payable in immediately available funds  to
the order of Seller in such amount).   (c) Insilco and Buyer shall enter
into an Assignment and  Assumption Agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as  Exhibit C (the "ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT"),
and Insilco  shall deliver to Buyer such special warranty deeds, bills of
sale,  endorsements, consents, assignments and other good and sufficient 
instruments of conveyance and assignment as the parties and their  respective
counsel shall deem reasonably necessary or appropriate to  vest in Buyer all
right, title and interest in, to and under the  Purchased Assets.  
21    (d) Seller and Buyer shall enter into a Management Services 
Agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D (the  "MANAGEMENT
SERVICES AGREEMENT").   (e) ThermaSys, Insilco and, in the case of Arup,
Insilco  Deutschland, shall execute agreements with respect to the purchase
of  the stock of Arup, Dalian and TCI in the form attached as Exhibit B-1 
hereto, and with respect to the shares of Arup and Dalian, as the Buyer  and
Seller may agree, and shall deliver stock certificates or other  evidence of
ownership in accordance with local law.   SECTION 4.08. CLOSING BALANCE
SHEET. (a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than 60 days, after the
Closing Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller a
closing balance sheet (the "CLOSING BALANCE SHEET"), together with a report
of KPMG Peat Marwick thereon, and a certificate based on such Closing Balance
Sheet setting forth Buyer\'s calculation of Closing Operating Working
Capital. The Closing Balance Sheet shall (x) fairly present the consolidated
financial position of the Business as at the close of business on the Closing
Date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
basis consistent with those used in the preparation of the Balance Sheet, (y)
include line items substantially consistent with those in the Balance Sheet,
and (z) be prepared in accordance with accounting policies and
practices consistent with those used in the preparation of the Balance Sheet
except that in preparing the Closing Balance Sheet, Buyer shall assume that
none of the Mergers has occurred. "CLOSING OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL" means
the Operating Working Capital of the Business as shown on the Closing Balance
Sheet.   (b) If Seller disagrees with Buyer\'s calculation of Closing
Operating Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 4.08(a), Seller may,
within 20 days after delivery of the documents referred to in Section
4.08(a), deliver a notice to Buyer disagreeing with such calculation and
setting forth Seller\'s calculation of such amount. Any such notice of
disagreement shall specify those items or amounts as to which Seller
disagrees, and Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts contained in the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of Closing
Operating Working Capital delivered pursuant to Section 4.08(a).   (c) If a
notice of disagreement shall be duly delivered pursuant to Section 4.08(b),
Buyer and Seller shall, during the 15 days following such delivery, use their
best efforts to reach agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to
determine, as may be required, the amount of Closing Operating Working
Capital, which amount shall not be less than the amount thereof shown in
Buyer\'s calculations delivered pursuant to Section 4.08(a) nor  
22   more than the amount thereof shown in Seller\'s calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 4.08(b). If during such period, Buyer and Seller are
unable to reach such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter cause a
mutually acceptable nationally recognized accounting firm (the "ACCOUNTING
REFEREE") promptly to review this Agreement and the disputed items or amounts
for the purpose of calculating Closing Operating Working Capital. In making
such calculation, the Accounting Referee shall consider only those items or
amounts in the Closing Balance Sheet or Buyer\'s calculation of Closing
Operating Working Capital as to which Seller has disagreed. The Accounting
Referee shall deliver to Buyer and Seller, as promptly as practicable, a
report setting forth such calculation. Such report shall be final and binding
upon Buyer and Seller. The cost of such review and report shall be borne (i)
by Buyer if the aggregate difference between Final Operating Working Capital
and Closing Operating Working Capital, as set forth in Buyer\'s calculation
of Closing Operating Working Capital, as the case may be, delivered pursuant
to Section 4.08(a) is greater than the difference between Final Operating
Working Capital and Closing Operating Working Capital, as set forth in
Seller\'s calculation of Closing Operating Working Capital, as the case may
be, delivered pursuant to Section 4.08(b), (ii) by Seller if the first such
aggregate difference is less than the second such aggregate difference and
(iii) otherwise equally by Buyer and Seller.   (d) Buyer and Seller agree
that they will, and agree to cause their respective independent accountants
to, cooperate and assist in the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and
the calculation of Closing Operating Working Capital and in the conduct of
the audits and reviews referred to in this Section 4.08, including without
limitation, the making available to the extent necessary of books, records,
work papers and personnel.   SECTION 4.09. ADJUSTMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE. (a)
If Estimated Operating Working Capital exceeds Final Operating Working
Capital, Seller shall pay to Buyer, as an adjustment to the Transaction
Consideration, in the manner and with interest as provided in Section
4.09(b), the amount of such excess. If Final Operating Working Capital
exceeds Estimated Operating Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to Seller, as an
adjustment to the Transaction Consideration, in the manner and with interest
as provided in Section 4.09(b), the amount of such excess. "FINAL OPERATING
WORKING CAPITAL" means Closing Operating Working Capital (i) as shown in
Buyer\'s calculation delivered pursuant to Section 4.08(a) if no notice of
disagreement with respect thereto is duly delivered pursuant to Section
4.08(b); or (ii) if such a notice of disagreement is delivered, (A) as agreed
by Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section 4.08(c) or (B) in the absence of such
agreement, as shown in the Accounting Referee\'s calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 4.08(c).   23    (b) Any payment pursuant to Section
4.09(a) shall be made at a mutually convenient time and place within 10 days
after Final Operating Working Capital has been determined by delivery by
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, of a certified or official bank check
payable in immediately available funds to the other party or by causing such
payments to be credited to such account of such other party as may be
designated by such other party. The amount of any payment to be made pursuant
to this Section 4.09 shall bear interest from and including the Closing Date
to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Prime
Rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect from
time to time during the period from the Closing Date to the date of payment.
Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the payment to which it
relates and shall be calculated daily on the basis of a year of 365 days
and the actual number of days elapsed.    ARTICLE 5  REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF SELLER   Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of the
date hereof and as of the Closing Date that:   SECTION 5.01. CORPORATE

incorporation and has all corporate powers and all material governmental
licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required to carry
on its business as now conducted, except for those licenses, authorizations,
permits, consents and approvals the absence of which would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Seller is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for
those jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not, individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Seller has heretofore
delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of Seller as currently in effect.   SECTION 5.02.
CORPORATE AUTHORIZATION. The execution, delivery and performance by Seller,
Insilco, Insilco Sub One, Insilco Sub Two and Insilco Sub Three of the

Insilco Sub One, Insilco Sub Two and Insilco Sub Three and have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller,
Insilco Sub One,   24   Insilco Sub Two and Insilco Sub Three. To the
extent each of them is a party thereto, the Transaction Documents constitute
valid and binding agreements of Seller, Insilco Sub One, Insilco Sub Two and
Insilco Sub Three.   SECTION 5.03. GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATION. The
execution, delivery and performance by Seller, Insilco, Insilco Sub One,
Insilco Sub Two and Insilco Sub Three of the Transaction Documents to which
it is a party and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby
require no action by or in respect of, or material filing with, any
governmental body, agency or official other than compliance with any
applicable requirements of the HSR Act.   SECTION 5.04. NONCONTRAVENTION.
The execution, delivery and performance by Seller, Insilco, Insilco Sub One,
Insilco Sub Two and Insilco Sub Three of the Transaction Documents to which

do not and will not (i) violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
Insilco, Insilco Sub One, Insilco Sub Two or Insilco Sub Three, (ii) assuming
compliance with the matters referred to in Section 5.03, violate any
applicable law, rule, regulation, judgment, injunction, order or decree,
except for any such violation which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) assuming the obtaining of
all Required Consents and Other Consents, constitute a default under or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any
material right or obligation of Buyer or to a loss of any benefit relating to
the Business to which Seller, Insilco, Insilco Sub One, Insilco Sub Two

Closing Date.   SECTION 10.05. W-2 REPORTING. Buyer shall be responsible for
issuing W-2 reports to all Transferred Employees for the entire calendar year

such information as may be necessary to permit Buyer to fulfill its

PARTY BENEFICIARIES. No provision of this Article shall create any third
party beneficiary or other rights in any employee or former employee
(including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of Seller or of any of its
subsidiaries in respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) with
either Buyer or the Businesses or any of their Affiliates and no provision of
this Article 10 shall create any such rights in any such Persons in respect
of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any

breach of any  covenant or agreement made or to be performed by Seller
pursuant to  this Agreement; PROVIDED that (A) Seller shall not be liable in
respect  of any Warranty Breach under Section 12.02(a)(i) unless the
aggregate  amount of Damages with respect to all Warranty Breaches referred
to in  Section 12.02(a)(i)   44    (determined without regard to any
materiality qualification contained  in any representation or warranty giving
rise to the claim for  indemnity hereunder) exceeds $500,000 and then only to

breach, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to  receive an amount equal
to the greater of (A) the prior award amount or  (B) the amount awarded by
the German Court, but in no event will the  Indemnifying Party (or its
affiliates) be required to pay both awards;   (ii) if such award results in
the payment of an amount, in the  aggregate, by the Indemnifying Party in
excess of the limitations set  forth in Section 12.02(a)(i)(B) and

CLAIMS. The following procedures shall be applicable with respect to
indemnification for indemnity claims arising in connection with any provision
of this Agreement.   (a) Promptly after receipt by the party seeking
indemnification, hereunder (an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") of notice of the
assertion or the commencement of any claim, liability or obligation, whether
by legal process or otherwise (a "CLAIM"), with respect to any matter within
the scope of Section 12.02, the Indemnified Party shall give written notice
thereof (the "NOTICE") to the Person from whom indemnification is sought
pursuant hereto (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") and shall thereafter keep the
Indemnifying Party reasonably informed with respect thereto; PROVIDED that
the failure of the Indemnified Party to give the Indemnifying Party prompt
notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
obligations hereunder unless such failure results in (i) a default judgment,
(ii) the expiration of the time to answer a complaint or (iii) material
prejudice to the Indemnifying Party\'s defense of such Claim. In case any
such Claim is brought against any Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof, by written notice of its
intention to the Indemnified Party within 30 days after receipt of the
Notice, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at the
Indemnifying Party\'s own expense. If the Indemnifying Party shall assume the
defense of such Claim, it shall not settle such Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the assumption by the Indemnifying
Party of the defense of any Claim as provided in this Section 12.03, the
Indemnified Party shall be permitted to join in the defense of such Claim and
to employ counsel at its own expense.   (b) If the Indemnifying Party shall
fail to notify the Indemnified Party of its desire to assume the defense of
any such Claim within the prescribed period of time, or shall notify the
Indemnified Party that it will not assume the defense of any such Claim, then
the Indemnified Party shall assume the defense of any such Claim, in which
event it may do so in such manner as it may deem appropriate. The
Indemnifying Party shall at the expense of the Indemnifying Party be
permitted to join in the defense of such Claim and to employ counsel at its
own expense.   46    SECTION 12.04. EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES. Seller and Buyer
acknowledge and agree that the remedies set forth in Section 12.01, Section
12.02, and Section 12.03, including the deductibles, liability limits,
survival periods, disclaimers and limitations, are, absent fraud, intended to
be, and shall be, the parties\' exclusive remedies with respect to any of the
matters covered therein. Without in any way limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, Seller and Buyer hereby expressly release, waive and
discharge, and covenant not to sue with respect to, any cause of action or
claim not expressly provided for in this Agreement.   ARTICLE 13 
TERMINATION   SECTION 13.01. GROUNDS FOR TERMINATION. This Agreement may

agreement of Seller and Buyer;   (b) by either Seller or Buyer if the
Closing shall not have been consummated on or before September 30, 2000;

obtained firmly committed financing for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and waived the condition to Closing set forth in Section 11.02(f);
or   (d) by either Seller or Buyer if there shall be any law or
regulation that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
illegal or otherwise prohibited or if consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or
judgment of any court or governmental body having competent jurisdiction.  
The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to clauses 13.01(b),
13.01(c) or 13.01(d) shall give notice of such termination to the other
party.   SECTION 13.02. EFFECT OF TERMINATION. If this Agreement is
terminated as permitted by Section 13.01, such termination shall be without
liability of either party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party to this
Agreement; provided that if such termination shall result from the (i)
willful failure of either party to fulfill a condition to the performance of
the obligations of the other party, (ii) failure to   47   perform a
covenant of this Agreement or (iii) breach by either party hereto of any
representation or warranty or agreement contained herein, such party shall be
fully liable for any and all Damages incurred or suffered by the other
party as a result of such failure or breach. The provisions of Sections 8.01,
12.01, 12.02, 12.03, 12.04, 14.03, 14.05, 14.06 and 14.07 shall survive any
