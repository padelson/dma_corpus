 THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of November 22, 2004, by and among First Reserve Fund IX, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership ("Fund IX"), Robertson Investment Trust LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("RIT"), Donald E. Vandenberg ("Vandenberg"), Richard M. Brillhart ("Brillhart"), Jeremy H. Grantham ("Grantham"), Charles Ian Landon ("Landon" and together with Fund IX, RIT, Vandenberg, Brillhart and Grantham, "Sellers") and Range Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer").   

RECITALS:    

 WHEREAS, Sellers own, in the aggregate, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Shares"), of PMOG Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PMOG");   

 WHEREAS, PMOG owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Pine Mountain Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PMAI") and PMAI owns all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Pine Mountain Oil and Gas Inc., a Virginia corporation (the "Asset Company");   

 WHEREAS, each Seller desires to sell the Shares held by such Seller to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase the same, all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and   

 WHEREAS, capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined shall have the meaning given such terms in _Article XII_;   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the legal sufficiency of which are herby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:   

ARTICLE I 
 PURCHASE AND SALE    

 1.1 _Agreement to Sell and to Purchase_.   

 (a) On the Closing Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein, each Seller shall transfer, sell, assign and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from each Seller, the Shares held by such Seller, free and clear of any and all Encumbrances.   

 (b) Subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the closing of such sale and purchase ("Closing") shall take place at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., 1001 Fannin, Suite 2300, Houston, Texas 77002-6760 on December 10, 2004; provided that (i) Buyer shall have the right to extend (one or more times) the date for Closing to a date not later than December 17, 2004 by giving Sellers written notice at least one (1) day prior to the date then    ##### 

  

 

scheduled for Closing; and (ii) if requested by Buyer by written notice to
Sellers prior to December 17, 2004, then Sellers, at their sole discretion,
may extend the date for Closing to a date not later than December 23, 2004 by
delivering written notice to Buyer on or prior to the then scheduled date for
Closing. Title to, ownership of and control over the Shares shall pass to
Buyer at Closing. At the Closing Sellers and Buyer shall deliver the items
set forth in _Section 7.2 _and _Section 8.2_, respectively.    

 1.2 _Purchase Price and Earnest Money_.   

 (a) In consideration of the transfer to Buyer of the Shares, and in accordance with this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to Sellers TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED FORTY FOUR DOLLARS ($224,877,244.00), in the aggregate (the "Purchase Price"), as adjusted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including without limitation _Sections 1.3_ and _1.4_ hereof.   

 (b) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Buyer shall make a deposit with JPMorgan Chase Bank ("Escrow Agent") in the amount of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), to be held by Escrow Agent as the "Earnest Money" pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and this Agreement. All fees payable to the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement shall be borne and paid one-half by Buyer and one-half by Sellers.   

 (c) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, then the Earnest Money and any interest earned thereon shall be distributed to Sellers (to accounts as shall be directed in writing by Fund IX, on behalf of Sellers, and in the amounts set forth in a schedule delivered by Fund IX, on behalf of Sellers, at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing) and shall be considered as payment of a portion of the Purchase Price, and the Purchase Price payable by Buyer at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of the Earnest Money and any interest earned thereon. In such event, at Closing Fund IX (on behalf of Sellers) and Buyer shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to accomplish the foregoing.   

 (d) If (i) all conditions precedent to the obligations of Buyer set forth in _Article VII_ have been met and neither Sellers nor any of their Affiliates are in material breach of any provisions of this Agreement; (ii) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated solely because the conditions to Sellers obligation to close set forth in _Sections 8.1_ or _8.2_ of this Agreement are not satisfied as of the Closing Date, and (iii) Sellers have exercised their right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(c)_ of this Agreement, then the Sellers shall be paid the Earnest Money and any interest earned thereon as liquidated damages. In the event that the Earnest Money and interest earned thereon is payable to Sellers as liquidated damages under this _Section 1.2(d)_, such payment to Sellers (i) shall be paid to Sellers in accordance with the _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase Price that would have been payable to each Seller, and (ii) shall constitute full and complete satisfaction of any and all damages Sellers may have as a result of the transactions not being consummated in accordance with this Agreement. Fund IX (on behalf of Sellers) and Buyer shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to accomplish the foregoing.   

 (e) If this Agreement is terminated under any circumstance other than as described in  _Section 1.2(d)_, then Buyer shall be entitled to the delivery of the Earnest Money and    ##### 

  

 

any interest earned thereon, free of any claims by Sellers with respect
thereto. In such event, Fund IX (on behalf of Sellers) and Buyer shall
execute and deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to
accomplish the foregoing. Buyer and Sellers shall thereupon have the rights
and obligations set forth in _Section 11.2_.    

 (f) At Closing, Buyer shall pay (a) the Purchase Price, adjusted as set forth in _Section 1.3_ , less the Earnest Money (and any interest earned thereon) and the Warranties Escrow to Sellers in cash in immediately available funds by wire transfer (to accounts as shall be directed in writing by Fund IX, on behalf of Sellers at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing) and in the amounts set forth in a schedule delivered by Fund IX, on behalf of Sellers at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing (containing an allocation of the Purchase Price among Sellers), and (b) the Warranties Escrow to the Escrow Agent to hold pursuant to this Agreement and the Post-Closing Escrow Agreement.   

 1.3 _Agreed Adjustments to Purchase Price at Closing_. On or before five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, Sellers will prepare and deliver to Buyer, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and GAAP, a proposed statement (the "Closing Statement") setting forth each adjustment to the Purchase Price required under this Agreement and showing the calculation of such adjustments. In preparing the Closing Statement, the Sellers shall communicate with Buyer and provide underlying data to Buyer relating to the Closing Statement. Within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Closing Statement, Buyer will deliver to Sellers a written report containing any proposed changes, together with an explanation of each change, that Buyer proposes to be made to the Closing Statement. The Closing Statement, as mutually agreed upon by the parties, will be used to adjust the Purchase Price at Closing. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted at the Closing Date as follows:   

 (a) the Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by the following:   

 (i) to the extent not included or accrued in the Net Working Capital, the value of all merchantable allowable oil or other liquid hydrocarbons in storage owned by the Asset Company above the pipeline connection at October 1, 2004, at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (the "Effective Time") (regardless of the date of execution of this Agreement), and not previously sold by the Asset Company or any of its Subsidiaries, that is credited to the Pine Mountain Assets, such value to be the contract price, or if no contract is in effect, the actual sales price, less severance and production taxes or gravity adjustments deducted by the purchaser of such oil or other liquids;   

 (ii) the Net Working Capital, if a positive figure;   

 (iii) all amounts that would be payable (if any) to any Purchased Company or its Subsidiaries if the Hedges were to be settled and terminated as of the Closing Date; and   

 (iv) any other amount agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers.   

 (b) The Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by the following:   

 (i) the total amount of Outstanding Indebtedness;    ##### 

  

  

 (ii) the Net Working Capital, if a negative figure;   

 (iii) all amounts that would be payable (if any) by any Purchased Company or its Subsidiaries if the Hedges were to be settled and terminated as of the Closing Date;   

 (iv) all change of control or other similar payments due and payable within 10 Business Days of the Closing under the Incentive Payment Agreements (including, without limitation, the employer share of any employment related Taxes with respect to such payments), to the extent not accrued or included in the Net Working Capital;   

 (v) all out-of-pocket expenditures incurred by any Purchased Company (including legal fees and brokers fees) in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, to the extent not accrued or included in the Net Working Capital;   

 (vi) any adjustment agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer, or determined by the Consultant, pursuant to _Section 7.1_;   

 (vii) an amount equal to all amounts paid by any Purchased Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the settlement and/or termination of any Hedge during the period from Effective Time up to the Closing Date;   

 (viii) any adjustments agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer, or determined pursuant to the Title Expert, pursuant to _Section 2.5_; and   

 (ix) any other amounts agreed upon by Buyer and Sellers.   

 1.4 _Adjustments to Purchase Price_. Except with respect to adjustments to the Purchase Price (a) for indemnification payments pursuant to _Article IX_ or _Section 6.14_, (b) pursuant to _Section 6.17_ and (c) for payment of any Target Bonus (including, without limitation, the employer share of any employment related Taxes with respect to such Target Bonus), within one hundred twenty (120) days after the Closing Date (the "Final Settlement Date"), Buyer will prepare and deliver to Sellers, in accordance with this Agreement and GAAP, a proposed statement (the "Final Settlement Statement") setting forth each adjustment to the Purchase Price required under this Agreement and showing the calculation of such adjustments and the resulting final Purchase Price (as set forth in the Final Settlement Statement, the "Final Price"). As soon as practicable, and in any event within thirty (30) days, after receipt of the preliminary Final Settlement Statement, Sellers shall return a written report containing any proposed changes to the preliminary Final Settlement Statement and an explanation of any such changes and the reasons therefor (the "Dispute Notice"). If the Final Price set forth in the Final Settlement Statement is mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer, the Final Settlement Statement and the Final Price, as mutually agreed upon by Sellers and Buyer, shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. Any difference in the Purchase Price as paid at Closing pursuant to the Closing Statement and the Final Price shall be paid by the owing party within ten (10) days to the owed party by wire transfer or other immediately available funds with such payments to be made, whether to or by Sellers, in accordance with the _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase Price received by Sellers.    ##### 

  

  

 1.5 _Disputes_. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve the matters addressed in the Dispute Notice, each of Buyer and Sellers shall within fourteen (14) Business Days after the delivery of such Dispute Notice, summarize its position with regard to such dispute in a written document of twenty-five pages or less and submit such summaries to the Houston, Texas office of Deloitte and Touche, LLP, or such other party as the parties may mutually select (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), together with the Dispute Notice, the Final Settlement Statement and any other documentation such party may desire to submit. Within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving the parties respective submissions, the Accounting Arbitrator shall render a decision choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to each matter addressed in any Dispute Notice, based on the materials described above and based upon the books and records of the Purchased Companies. Any decision rendered by the Accounting Arbitrator pursuant hereto shall be final, conclusive and binding on Sellers and Buyer and will be enforceable against any of the parties in any court of competent jurisdiction.

 (a) From and after the date hereof and up to and including the Closing Date (or earlier termination of this Agreement) but subject to the other provisions of this _Section 2.1_ and obtaining any required consents of Third-Parties, including Third-Party operators of the Pine Mountain Assets (with respect to which consents Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain), Sellers shall afford to Buyer and its officers, employees, agents, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers and other authorized representatives ("Buyers Representatives") full access, during normal business hours, to the Pine Mountain Assets and all Records and other documents in the Purchased Companies, Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates possession relating to the Purchased Companies and their businesses. Sellers shall also make available to Buyer and Buyers Representatives, upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, Sellers and the Asset Companys personnel knowledgeable with respect to the Pine Mountain Assets in order that Buyer may make such diligence investigation as Buyer considers necessary or appropriate. All investigations and due diligence conducted by Buyer or any Buyers Representative shall be conducted at Buyers sole cost and expense and any conclusions made from any examination done by Buyer or any Buyers Representative shall result from Buyers own independent review and judgment.   

 (b) Buyer shall be entitled to conduct a Phase I environmental property assessment with respect to the Pine Mountain Assets that satisfies the basic assessment requirements set forth under the current American Society for Testing and Material Standard Practice for Phase I environmental property assessments (Designation E1527-00) but, except as set forth below in this  _Section 2.1(b)_, such Phase I environmental property assessment shall not include on-site testing of any non-scope issues as such issues are described in Article 12 of such Standard Practice.

Pine Mountain Assets where the Asset Company does not have the authority to
grant access for such due diligence (provided, however, the Sellers shall
cause the Asset Company to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
permission from any Third Party to allow Buyer and Buyers Representatives
such access). In the event that Buyers Phase I environmental property
assessments identify actual or potential "recognized environmental concerns",
then Buyer may request Sellers permission to conduct additional Phase II
environmental property assessments. The additional Phase II environmental
property assessment procedures relating to any additional investigation shall
be submitted to Sellers in a Phase II environmental property assessment plan.
Thereafter, Sellers may, in their sole discretion, approve said Phase II
environmental property assessment plan, in whole or in part and Buyer shall
not have the right to conduct any activities set forth in such plan until

Phase II environmental property assessment plan shall be performed in

 (d) Buyer agrees to promptly provide Sellers, but in no less than five (5) days after receipt or creation, copies of all final reports and test results, prepared by Buyer and/or any of Buyers Representatives and which contain data collected or generated from Buyers due diligence with respect to the Pine Mountain Assets. Sellers shall not be deemed by their receipt of said documents or otherwise to have made representation or warranty, expressed, implied or statutory, as to the condition to the Pine Mountain Assets or to the accuracy of said documents or the information contained therein.   

 (e) Upon completion of Buyers due diligence, Buyer shall at its sole cost and expense and without any cost or expense to Sellers or their Affiliates, (i) close all bore holes from its Phase I environmental property assessment and any approved work with respect to a Phase II environmental property assessment in accordance with recognized industry standards, (ii) repair all damage done to the Pine Mountain Assets in connection with Buyers due diligence, (iii) restore the Pine Mountain Assets to the approximate same or better condition than it was prior to commencement of Buyers due diligence and (iv) remove all equipment, tools or other property brought onto the Pine Mountain Assets in connection with Buyers due diligence.    #####

the real property associated with such Pine Mountain Assets) resulting from
Buyers due diligence will be promptly corrected by Buyer.    

 (f) During all periods that Buyer, and/or any of Buyers Representatives are on the Pine Mountain Assets, Buyer shall maintain, at its sole expense and with insurers reasonably satisfactory to Sellers, policies of insurance of the types and in the amounts reasonably requested by Sellers. Coverage under all insurance required to be carried by Buyer hereunder will (i) be primary insurance, (ii) list the Seller Group as additional insureds, (iii) waive subrogation against the Seller Group and (iv) provide for five (5) days prior notice to Sellers in the event of cancellation or modification of the policy or reduction in coverage. Upon request by Sellers, Buyer shall provide evidence of such insurance to the Asset Company prior to entering the Pine Mountain Assets.   

 2.2 _Produced Materials and Wastes_. Buyer acknowledges that the Pine Mountain Assets have been utilized for the purposes of exploration, development and production of oil and gas. Waste materials therefrom, including, without limitation, asbestos, crude oil, and gases with associate wastes and chemicals, produced water and injected waters with associated chemicals, compounds and by-products and drilling fluids and associated chemicals, compounds and drill cuttings, may have been spilled or disposed of on-site or off-site through methods such as, but not limited to, pit closures, burial, line or well failures, land farming, land spreading, surface pits and underground injection. Buyer acknowledges that such activities may have produced conditions regarded as environmentally adverse. In addition, some production equipment may contain asbestos or naturally occurring radioactive material (hereinafter referred to as "NORM"). In this regard, Buyer expressly understands and agrees that NORM may affix or attach itself to the inside of wells, materials and equipment as scale or in other forms, and that said wells, materials and equipment located on the properties may contain NORM and that NORM-containing material may be buried or otherwise disposed of on the properties. Further, Buyer acknowledges that, as a result of the historic operations of these Pine Mountain Assets, NORM may be present in air, water or soil on or near the sites and that Sellers may be unaware of the presence of some or all of such NORM. Buyer hereby releases each member of the Seller Group from any liability with respect to any such adverse environmental condition.

 (b) Except to the extent (and only to the extent) that Sellers are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Group pursuant to _Section 6.14_ and/or _Section 9.2_, Buyer expressly acknowledges that the Purchased Companies are responsible, and none of the Purchased Companies, Buyer or their respective Affiliates shall have recourse against any member of the Seller Group, for the debts, liabilities, commitments, duties and obligations of the Purchased Companies, including those arising under, related to, or in connection with the ownership, operation or use of the Pine Mountain Assets or the business of the Asset Company or its Subsidiaries and whether or not such debts, liabilities, commitments, duties or obligation arise or relate to periods of time prior to or after the Effective Time.   

 2.4 _Disclaimers_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise expressly set forth in _Article III_ or _IV_ of this Agreement, none of Sellers or any Affiliate of a Seller makes any representation or warranty, express, statutory, implied or otherwise with respect to the Pine Mountain Assets, the Purchased Companies or the Shares. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in _Article III_ or _IV_ of this Agreement, each Seller, for itself and its/his Affiliates, hereby expressly disclaims any and all representations and warranties associated with the Pine Mountain Assets, the Purchased Companies and the Shares, express, statutory, implied or otherwise, including any representation or warranty regarding: (a) title, (b) any costs, expenses, revenues, receipts, accounts receivable, or accounts payable, (c) any contractual, economic or financial information and data associated with the Pine Mountain Assets, the Purchased Companies or the Shares, (d) the continued financial viability or productivity of the Pine Mountain Assets or transportability of product, (e) the environmental or physical condition of the Pine Mountain Assets, (f) any federal, state, local or tribal income or other Tax consequences associated with the Pine Mountain Assets, the Purchased Companies or the Shares, (g) the absence of patent or latent defects, (h) the state of repair of the Pine Mountain Assets, (i) merchantability or conformity to models, (j) fitness for a particular purpose and (k) production rates, recompletion opportunities, decline rates or the quality, quantity or volume of the reserves of hydrocarbons, if any, attributable to the Pine Mountain Assets. Each Seller, for itself and its/his Affiliates, expressly disclaims any and all representations and warranties, except as otherwise expressly set forth in _Articles III_ or _IV_ associated with the quality, accuracy, completeness or materiality of the information, data and materials furnished (whether electronically, orally, by video, in writing or any other medium, by compact disk, in any data room, or otherwise) at any time to Buyer Group associated with transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including, information, data or materials regarding: (a) title to the Pine Mountain Assets, (b) costs, expenses, revenues, receipts, accounts receivable or accounts payable associated with the Pine Mountain Assets, (c) contractual, economic or financial information associated with the Pine Mountain Assets, the Purchased Companies or the Shares, (d) the continued financial viability or productivity of the Pine Mountain Assets, or transportability of product, (e) the environmental or physical condition of the Pine Mountain Assets, (f) federal, state, local or tribal income or other Tax consequences associated with the Pine Mountain Assets, the Purchased Companies or the Shares, (g) the absence of patent or latent defects, (h) the state of repair of the Pine Mountain Assets, (i) any warranty regarding merchantability or conformity to models, (j) any rights of any member of Buyer Group under appropriate Laws to claim diminution of consideration or return of the purchase price, (k) any warranty of freedom from patent, copyright or trademark infringement, (l) warranties    #####

 2.5 _Title Matters_. (a) After the execution hereof, Buyer shall have the right to conduct such title examination of the Pine Mountain Assets as Buyer deems necessary or appropriate. If Buyer determines in good faith that any Title Defect exists, then Buyer may give Sellers written notice on or prior to the Defect Notice Date of any claimed Title Defect (each such Title Defect is referred to as a "Pre-Closing Title Defect"). To be effective, each such notice shall set forth (a) a description of the matter constituting the claimed Pre-Closing Title Defect, and (b) the proposed Purchase Price reduction for the cost of curing the Pre-Closing Title Defect in question. Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any claimed Pre-Closing Title Defect on or before Closing. The parties shall reduce the Purchase Price to reflect the mutually agreed upon estimated cost of curing all Pre-Closing Title Defects not cured by Sellers prior to Closing; provided, however, that if the estimated costs to cure such Pre-Closing Title Defects in the aggregate exceed the Materiality Threshold, either Buyer or Sellers may terminate this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no adjustment to the Purchase Price for any Pre-Closing Title Defects will be made unless the aggregate adjustments for all Pre-Closing Title Defects exceed $2,000,000 (the "Title Threshold"), but if such Title Threshold is met, the adjustment to the Purchase Price for such Pre-Closing Title Defects shall be from the first dollar of such defects.   

 (b) If Sellers and Buyer cannot agree on the existence of a Pre-Closing Title Defect or the adjustment, if any, therefor on or before December 10, 2004, then the dispute will be submitted by December 10, 2004 to a title attorney selected by Sellers and Buyer (such title attorney hereinafter, "Title Expert"). The Title Expert will have expertise in title matters in the State in which the Pine Mountain Asset affected by the Title Defect in dispute is located and the costs of the Title Expert will be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Buyer. Sellers and Buyer will each present the Title Expert a written statement of its position on the defect and/or adjustment in question not later than the third (3rd) day after the dispute has been submitted to the Title Expert. By the third (3rd) day following the submission of a matter to a Title Expert, the Title Expert shall make a determination of the dispute, choosing either Sellers position or Buyers position with respect to such dispute. The decision of the Title Expert will be final, conclusive and binding on Sellers and Buyer and will be enforceable against any of the parties in any court of competent jurisdiction.   

 (c) Except for Buyers remedies under this Agreement for a breach of Sellers representation contained in _Section 4.22_, (i) the Purchase Price adjustment mechanism set forth in this  _Section 2.5_ shall be the exclusive remedy for Buyer and its Affiliates with respect to any Title Defects, and (ii) any Title Defect for which Buyer does not notify Sellers on or prior to the Defect Notice Date, shall be deemed and is hereby waived by Buyer on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates (including, post-Closing, the Purchased Companies). Nothing contained in this  _Section 2.5(c)_ shall be construed to be a waiver or release by Buyer or its Affiliates of Buyers remedies for a breach by Sellers of the representation contained in _Section 4.22_.    #####

Prior to the Closing but subject to the provisions of the Incentive Payment Agreements, neither the Purchased Companies nor Sellers shall cause the provision of material increases in compensation or benefits, or pay additional bonuses, or enter into new employment, severance or change of control agreements respecting the employees of the Asset Company, other than in the ordinary course of business. Contemporaneously with the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Asset Company to make all payments due and owing by the Asset Company under the Incentive Payment Agreements to the counterparties thereto.    ##### 

  

  

 6.8 _COBRA_. Buyer shall assume, or cause the Asset Company to retain, the obligations to satisfy the health benefit continuation requirements of Section 6.01, _et seq._ of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code with respect to the Asset Company and all of its employees, whether terminated prior to or after the Closing.   

 6.9 _Intentionally Omitted_.   

 6.10 _Payment of Indebtedness by Affiliates and Subsidiaries_. To the extent not accounted for in any adjustment to the Purchase Price, Sellers will have caused all indebtedness owed to a Purchased Company by any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller to be paid in full at or prior to Closing.   

 6.11 _No Negotiation_. Until such time, if any, as this Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Article XI_, Sellers will not, and will cause each Purchased Company and each of their representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit or initiate any inquiries or proposals from, or discuss or negotiate with, any Person (other than Buyer) relating to any transaction involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Asset Company or any of the capital stock of any Purchased Company, or any merger, consolidation, business combination, or similar transaction involving any Purchased Company.   

 6.12 _Retention of Hedges_. Sellers shall cooperate, and shall cause the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries to cooperate, with Buyer in connection with retaining the Hedges when Closing occurs as obligations of the Purchased Companies and/or their Subsidiaries who are currently parties thereto; provided that neither Sellers nor any Purchased Company or its Subsidiaries shall be required to spend any monies to comply with the foregoing covenant.   

 6.13 _Termination of Stockholder Agreement_. Contemporaneously with the Closing, Sellers and PMOG shall terminate the Stockholder Agreement.   

 6.14 _Tax Matters_.   

 (a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_. The Buyer and the Purchased Companies shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, in a manner consistent with the Purchased Companies or the Cenestia Partnerships prior Tax Returns (except as otherwise required by law), all Tax Returns that (i) are required to be filed by, or with respect to, the Purchased Companies or the Cenestia Partnerships for Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and for Tax periods that begin before and end after September 30, 2004 (the "Straddle Period") and (ii) are not filed as of the Closing Date. The Buyer shall provide each such Tax Return to the Sellers, not later than twenty (20) days before the due date for such Tax Return (taking into account any extensions of such due date), for the Sellers review and approval. The Sellers approval of each such Tax Return shall not be unreasonably withheld. Subject to resolving any dispute with the Sellers, the Buyer shall cause the Purchased Companies and the Cenestia Partnerships to timely file each such Tax Return. Buyer shall cause the Purchased Companies to pay all Taxes due with respect to the period covered by each such Tax Return. The Sellers shall pay to the Buyer (or the Buyer shall pay to the Sellers), as an adjustment to the Purchase Price, the amount by which the Tax attributable to the Pre-Effective Time Tax Period (calculated, in the    ##### 

  

 

case of Straddle Periods, in accordance with  _Section 6.14(c)_ below)
exceeds (or is less than) the accrued liability for Taxes included in
determining the Net Working Capital. Any payment by the Sellers to the Buyer
(or by the Buyer to the Sellers) under this _Section 6.14(a)_ shall be made
no later than the later of (i) the due date (excluding extensions) for filing
the original Tax Return, or, in the case of real estate Taxes, the due date
(excluding extensions) for payment to the Governmental Entity and (ii)
ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (or if such date is not a business
day, the first business day thereafter). In the event that an extension is
obtained for the filing of any such Tax Return, (i) the payment obligation of
the Sellers to the Buyer (or by the Buyer to the Sellers) under this 
_Section 6.14(a)_ with respect to such Tax Return shall be based upon the
amount of the estimated payment (if any) due as of the original due date of
such Tax Return and (ii) a payment shall be made by the Sellers to the Buyer
(or by the Buyer to the Sellers) in an amount necessary to reflect the
difference between the Tax liability attributable to the Pre-Effective Time
Tax Period (calculated, in the case of Straddle Periods, in accordance with
_Section 6.14(c)_ below) shown as due and payable on the final form of
such Tax Return and the amount of the estimated payment previously made with
respect to such Tax Return. The Buyer shall provide the Sellers with notice
of the amount of any payment required to be made by the Sellers to the Buyer
(or by the Buyer to the Sellers) pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of
the preceding sentence, no later than the date that such estimated payment is
made or such Tax Return is filed in final form, and any such payment shall be
made within five (5) days of such notice. The Buyer and the Purchased
Companies shall not file or cause the Cenestia Partnerships to file
any amended Tax Returns or make any Tax election with respect to Taxes of or
relating to any Purchased Company or any Cenestia Partnership for any taxable
year that ends on or before or includes September 30, 2004 which would
reasonably be likely to result in an indemnity payment pursuant to  _Section
6.14(b)_, without the prior written consent of the Sellers.    

 (b) _Liability for Taxes_. Except as provided in _Section 6.15_, the Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of and shall indemnify and hold the Seller Group harmless from and against (i) all Taxes of the Purchased Companies for all Pre-Effective Time Tax Periods, but with respect to Pre-Effective Time Tax Periods or portions thereof commencing after August 13, 2003 only to the extent that the liability for such Taxes does not exceed the accrued liability for such Taxes included in determining the Net Working Capital, and (ii) all Taxes of the Purchased Companies for Post-Effective Time Tax Periods, as well as, in either case, any Losses arising out of, resulting from or attributable to such Taxes. Except as provided in _Section 6.15_ and subject to the limitations provided in _Sections 9.2(b)_ and _9.3(c)_ as if such Taxes were Losses, the Sellers shall indemnify and hold the Buyer Group harmless from and against (A) all Taxes of the Purchased Companies for Pre-Effective Time Tax Periods or portions thereof commencing after August 13, 2003 to the extent that the liability for such Taxes exceeds the accrued liability for such Taxes included in determining the Net Working Capital and (B) any Taxes of the Purchased Companies resulting from the sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition by any Purchased Company of an interest in any Cenestia Partnership during the period beginning on (and including) the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, and ending on (and including) the Closing Date, as well as, in each case, any Losses arising out of, resulting from or attributable to such Taxes.   

 (c) _Division of the Straddle Period_. In order to apportion appropriately any Taxes relating to a Straddle Period, the parties hereto shall, to the extent permitted under applicable law, elect with the relevant Governmental Entity to treat for all purposes September 30, 2004 as the last day of the Tax year or period of each Purchased Company. In any case    ##### 

  

 

where applicable law does not permit any Purchased Company to treat September
30, 2004 as the last day of the Tax year or period with respect to Taxes that
are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Tax
that is allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on September
30, 2004 will be:    

 (i) in the case of Taxes that are either (A) income Taxes or (B) imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property (other than any Taxes imposed on any sales conveyance made pursuant to this Agreement or contemplated by transactions described herein, the payment of which is governed by _Section 6.15_), deemed equal to the amount that would have been payable had the relevant Tax year or period ended on September 30, 2004 (except that, solely for purposes of determining the marginal tax rate applicable to the income or receipts during such period in a jurisdiction in which such tax rate depends upon the level of income or receipts, annualized income or receipts may be taken into account, if appropriate for an equitable sharing of such Taxes); and   

 (ii) in the case of Taxes not included in clause (i) of this _Section 6.14(c)_ that are imposed on a periodic basis and measured by the level of any item (including real estate tax regardless of whether such tax is payable to a taxing authority, a landlord or other third party), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on September 30, 2004 and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period.   

 In determining the Straddle Period for real estate Taxes, the Tax period as reflected on the statement of Taxes due, property Tax bill, property "tax ticket," or any other request for payment from a Governmental Entity will determine the taxable period ( _e.g._ , a West Virginia Statement of Taxes Due that indicates the tax year as 2002 is for a Tax for the taxable period January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002). In determining the Straddle Period for franchise, doing business and capital Taxes, the period for which the payment of any such Tax provides the right to do business will determine the taxable period ( _e.g._ , a state franchise tax payable for the right to do business for the calendar year 2002 is a Tax for the taxable period January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002).   

 (d) _Tax Refunds_.   

 (i) Except as provided in _Section 6.14(d)(ii)_, the Sellers will be entitled to any credits and refunds (including interest received thereon) in respect of any Taxes for which the Sellers have agreed to indemnify Buyer pursuant to _Section 6.14(b)_. Nothing in this  _Section 6.14(d)_ will preclude any Purchased Company from making an election under Section 172(b) of the Code or any comparable provision of law or regulations for any taxable year beginning after September 30, 2004.   

 (ii) If Buyer notifies the Sellers in writing that any Purchased Company has become entitled to a refund or credit of Taxes described in _Section 6.14(d)(i)_, and such refund or credit is attributable solely to the carryback of losses, credits or similar items of such Purchased Company from a taxable period beginning after September 30, 2004, such    ##### 

  

 

Purchased Company will file a claim for a refund or credit with respect to
such losses, credits or similar items and such Purchased Company will be
entitled to retain the amount of any such refund or credit received (together
with interest thereon).    

 (iii) Except as provided in _Sections 6.14(d)(i)_ and _(ii)_ , the Purchased Companies will be entitled to any refunds (including any interest received thereon) in respect of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax liability of the Purchased Companies.   

 (e) _Tax Proceedings; Cooperation_.   

 (i) In the event that the Sellers would be liable for the payment of any Taxes under  _Section 6.14(b)_, if assessed or imposed, and such Taxes are assessed against or imposed on a Purchased Company or the Buyer by any Governmental Entity, the Sellers, in their sole and absolute discretion, will have the right to participate at their own expense in any audit involving any such Taxes and/or to contest any assertion that any such Taxes are payable in any proceedings available to the Purchased Company or the Buyer. The Sellers, on the one hand, and such Purchased Company and the Buyer, on the other hand, shall fully cooperate in good faith in connection with any such audit or other proceeding.   

 (ii) In respect of a contest or audit related to Taxes for which the Sellers would be solely liable under _Section 6.14(b)_, the Sellers will have the right to control all proceedings in connection with such contest or audit; provided, however, that, as a precondition to the Sellers right to control such proceedings, (A) the Sellers shall deliver to the Buyer a written statement in which the Sellers agree to pay to the relevant Purchased Company and the Buyer all costs and expenses that the relevant Purchased Company and the Buyer incur in connection with such contest or audit and (B) the Sellers shall conduct the defense actively and diligently; and provided further, however, that the Sellers shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement without the prior written consent of such Purchased Company and/or the Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, if (x) such judgment or settlement is likely to establish a precedential custom or practice materially adverse to the continuing business of such Purchased Company and/or the Buyer for periods beginning after September 30, 2004 or (y) the Taxes at issue in the proceeding relate to a Straddle Period.   

 (iii) So long as the Sellers are conducting the defense in accordance with _Section 6.14(e)(ii)_ , and subject to the Buyers rights in _Section 6.14(e)(ii)_, the relevant Purchased Company and/or the Buyer may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and may participate in, but not control, such defense.   

 (iv) In the event that any of the conditions in _Section 6.14(e)(ii)_ is or becomes unsatisfied, (A) the relevant Purchased Company and/or the Buyer may control the defense, and consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement, in any manner that it reasonably may deem appropriate, with the consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, (B) the Sellers shall reimburse such Purchased Company and/or the Buyer promptly and periodically for the costs of defense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) not theretofore paid by the Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.14(e)(ii)_ and (C) the Sellers shall remain jointly and severally responsible for any Taxes and other Losses in accordance with and to the extent provided in _Section 6.14(b)_.    ##### 

  

  

 (v) In respect of a contest or audit related to both Taxes for which the Buyer is indemnified under _Section 6.14(b)_, and for which Buyer is not indemnified under _Section 6.14(b)_ , Buyer shall control the conduct of such contest or audit, but the Sellers shall have the right to participate in such contest or audit at their own expense, and Buyer shall not settle, compromise and/or concede such contest or audit without the consent of the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.   

 (vi) The Sellers and Buyer agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information (including access to books and records) and assistance relating to the Purchased Companies as is reasonably requested for the filing of any Tax Returns and the preparation, prosecution, defense or conduct of any contest or other Tax proceeding. The Sellers and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the conduct of any contest or other proceeding involving or otherwise relating to the Purchased Companies (or their income or assets) with respect to any Tax and each shall execute and deliver such powers of attorney and other documents as are necessary to carry out the intent of this _Section 6.14(e)_ or _Section 6.16_. Any information obtained under this _Section 6.14(e)(vi)_ shall be kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or in the conduct of a contest or other Tax proceeding.   

 (f) The indemnities provided in this _Section 6.14_ are in addition to, but not in duplication of, the indemnities provided in _Article IX_. The provisions of _Article IX_ , including the limitations of _Section 9.2(b)_ and _9.3(c)_ , shall apply to claims for indemnification and breaches of covenants and other payments under this _Section 6.14_ ; provided that to the extent any procedural provisions of _Section 9.4_ are inconsistent with the procedural provisions of _Section 6.14(e)_, such provisions of  _Section 6.14(e)_ shall apply.   

 6.15 _Payment of Transfer Taxes and Other Charges_. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, each shall be responsible for and shall pay one half of all stock transfer taxes, real property transfer taxes, sales taxes, documentary stamp taxes, recording charges and other similar Taxes, if any, arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that such Taxes shall not include any income taxes payable by the Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall prepare and file, and shall fully cooperate with each other party with respect to the preparation and filing of, any Tax Returns and other filings relating to any such Taxes or charges as may be required and shall take such other reasonable actions as may be necessary to minimize the amount of any such Taxes.   

 6.16 _Certain Tax Issues_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including, without limitation, _Section 6.14_), on or prior to the date that is eleven months after the Closing Date, Sellers shall, at Sellers sole cost and expense (less any net Tax overpayment made collectively by the Purchased Companies and their Subsidiaries for time periods commencing after August 13, 2003 and prior to the Effective Time, but without duplication under  _Section 6.14(d)_), cause the Tax issues set forth in _Schedule 6.16_ to be cured as further described in such Schedule.   

 6.17 _Certain Pre-Effective Time Revenues_. (a) The parties acknowledge that the Asset Company is entitled to payments from Third Persons for transporting Gas through the    ##### 

  

 

Widen Pipeline for the period from April 2004 through September 2004 (the
"Widen Transportation Revenues"). From and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to
cause the Asset Company to use its reasonable efforts to pursue the
collection of the Widen Transportation Revenues. Promptly upon the Asset
Companys receipt of any Widen Transportation Revenues, Buyer shall pay such
Widen Transportation Revenues, less (i) all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by the Asset Company to Third Parties in order to obtain such Widen
Transportation Revenues and (ii) the amount of any Tax payable by the Asset
Company by reason of its receipt of such Widen Transportation Revenues, to
Sellers ( _pro rata_ in proportion to the _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase
Price received by Sellers).    

 (b) The parties acknowledge that the Asset Company may be entitled to royalty payments attributable to wells not shown on Exhibit B in the State of Wyoming with respect to which royalty payments the operator thereof has not sent division orders to the Asset Company and which royalty payments are not accrued for or included in determining Net Working Capital. To the extent that any such royalty payments are attributable to the period of time during the Ownership Period (the "Wyoming Pre-Effective Time Royalties"), then upon the Asset Companys receipt of any Wyoming Pre-Effective Time Royalties, Buyer shall pay such Wyoming Pre-Effective Time Royalties, less (i) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Asset Company to Third Parties in order to obtain such Wyoming Pre-Effective Time Royalties and (ii) the amount of any Tax payable by the Asset Company by reason of its receipt of such Wyoming Pre-Effective Time Royalties, to Sellers ( _pro rata_  in proportion to the _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase Price received by Sellers).   

 (c) The parties acknowledge that the Asset Company may be entitled to additional revenues on account of payouts under an Equitable Agreement that may have occurred for wells (other than the wells that are the subject of the Equitable Dispute) subject to an Equitable Agreement. To the extent that such additional revenues are attributable to periods of time during the Ownership Period (the "Payout Revenues"), then from and after the Closing, Buyer agrees to cause the Asset Company to use its reasonable efforts to pursue the collection of the Payout Revenues. Promptly upon the Asset Companys receipt of any Payout Revenues, Buyer shall pay such Payout Revenues, less (iii) all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Asset Company to Third Parties in order to obtain such Payout Revenues and (iv) the amount of any Tax payable by the Asset Company by reason of its receipt of such Payout Revenues, to Sellers ( _pro rata_ in proportion to the _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase Price received by Sellers).   

 (d) All payments received by Sellers pursuant to this _Section 6.17_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price.   

 6.18 _Cooperation with Financial Statements_. Sellers and Buyer agree to use their reasonable efforts to cooperate with KPMG, LLP in its preparation of audited consolidated financial statements of PMOG and its Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2003 to be completed as soon as is reasonably possible. Sellers agree to use their reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in Buyers preparation of unaudited consolidated financial statements of PMOG and its Subsidiaries, prepared in accordance with GAAP, as of, and for the nine month period ended, September 30, 2004, to be completed as soon as is reasonably possible; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers will not be required to represent or certify the unaudited financial statements conformity with GAAP, and Buyer will rely on its judgment    ##### 

  

 

as to whether the resulting unaudited financial statements are, in fact,
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Sellers shall not be deemed to be in breach
of this _Section 6.18_ if KPMG, LLP is unable to timely prepare such
financial statements. Sellers further agree to use their reasonable efforts
to cause KPMG, LLP to deliver to Buyer upon its reasonable request such
consents as may be required under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder in connection with the use of financial statements
audited by KPMG, LLP covering periods during the Ownership Period. The costs
to prepare the audited financial statements by KPMG, LLP, the unaudited
financial statements of PMOG and its Subsidiaries and obtaining the consents
of KPMG, LLP shall be shared one-half by Sellers and one-half by
Buyer.    

ARTICLE VII 
 BUYERS CONDITIONS    

 The obligation of Buyer to purchase the Shares as contemplated hereby is, at the option of Buyer, subject to the satisfaction on or before the Closing Date of the conditions set forth below, any of which may be waived by Buyer in writing.   

 7.1 _Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The representations and warranties of Sellers contained in _Article III_ and _IV_ of this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects (or, to the extent such representations and warranties are qualified by materiality, in all respects) on and as of the Closing Date, in each case with the same force and effect as though such representations and warranties had been made or given on and as of the Closing Date; and each and all of the agreements and covenants of Sellers to be performed or complied with by Sellers on or before the Closing Date pursuant to this Agreement shall have been performed or complied with in all material respects. For purposes of the foregoing, it shall not be deemed to be a failure of a representation or warranty of Sellers contained in _Article III_ or _IV_ this Agreement to be true and correct in all material respects (or, to the extent such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality, in all respects) on and as of the Closing Date if (a) such failure, together with all other failures of any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in _Article III_ or _IV_ of this Agreement to be true and correct in all material respects (or, to the extent such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality, in all respects) on and as of the Closing Date, would not result in a loss in excess of the Materiality Threshold, or (b) such failure would otherwise result in an adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 1.3_ of this Agreement (excluding _Section 1.3(b)(vi)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement but subject to the preceding sentence, in the event that Buyer discovers and/or Sellers or the Purchased Companies disclose at or prior to Closing that any representation or warranty of Sellers contained in _Article III_ or _IV_ of this Agreement will fail to be true and correct in all material respects (or, to the extent such representation or warranty is qualified by materiality, in all respects) on and as of the Closing Date and such failure (together with all other such failures) would not result in a loss in excess of the Materiality Threshold, then Buyer will notify Sellers of Buyers estimate of the loss in value due to such failure. Sellers and Buyer shall use their reasonable efforts to agree upon the amount of any such loss in value and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the agreed upon amount and Buyer and Sellers shall proceed with Closing. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to agree upon whether there is any failure of a representation or warranty made by Sellers contained in _Article_     ##### 

  

  

 _III_ or _IV_ of this Agreement to be true and correct in all material
respects (or, to the extent such representation or warranty is qualified by
materiality, in all respects) on and as of the Closing Date or any adjustment
therefor, then Sellers or Buyer may submit the dispute to an
attorney selected by Sellers and Buyer who is a Person familiar with mergers
and acquisitions law in the State of Texas (the "Consultant") and the costs
of such Consultant will be borne and paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by
Buyer. Sellers and Buyer will each present the Consultant a written statement
of its position on the dispute in question not later than two (2) days after
the dispute has been submitted to the Consultant. Within two (2) days
following the submission of a matter to an attorney, the Consultant shall
make a determination of the dispute, choosing either Sellers position or
Buyers position with respect to such dispute. The decision of the Consultant
will be final, conclusive and binding on Sellers and Buyer and will be
enforceable against any of the parties in any court of competent

 7.3 _No Litigation_. No preliminary or permanent injunction or other order of any Governmental Entity shall be in effect or threatened that prevents the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No suit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation before any Governmental Entity shall have been commenced or threatened by any Person (other than Buyer or its Affiliates) seeking to prevent the sale of the Shares or asserting that the sale of all or a portion of the Shares would be unlawful.   

 7.4 _No Claim Regarding Share Ownership_.

 (b) Except as otherwise limited by this _Article IX_, effective upon Closing, each Seller, severally and not jointly, based on the _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase Price received by such Seller, indemnifies and holds harmless each member of the Buyer Group from and against any and all Losses arising out of, resulting from or attributable to any of the following (except to the extent Buyer has received a Purchase Price adjustment for such items under _Article I_,  _Section 2.5_ or _Section 7.1_ hereof): (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers in _Article IV_ or the corresponding representation or warranty in the certificate delivered by such Seller pursuant to _Section 7.2(h)_ and (ii) any breach of any covenant made by Sellers set forth in this Agreement other than under _Section 9.2(a)_.   

 9.3 _Limits on Indemnification; Payment_.   

 (a) Except as set forth in clause (b) below and except with respect to a breach of Sellers representations, warranties or covenants set forth in _Section 3.5_, _4.8_ ,  _6.14_ or _6.16_ , Sellers shall have no obligation or liability under _Section 9.2_ unless and until the aggregate amount of the Losses suffered by the Buyer Group exceeds the Threshold Amount; provided, however, that once the amount of such Losses suffered exceeds the Threshold Amount with respect to the Buyer Group Sellers shall be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Group only to the extent that such Losses exceed, and only in amounts that exceed, the Threshold Amount.   

 (b) For purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of Losses claimed against Sellers, the amount of each Loss shall be reduced by (i) any third-party insurance benefits    ##### 

  

 

that the Buyer Group received or reasonably expected to be received in
respect of or as a result of such Losses, less the reasonable costs incurred
by the Buyer Group to recover those insurance benefits to the extent such
costs are not otherwise recovered and (ii) any net Tax benefit realized by the
Buyer Group in respect of or as a result of such Losses. For this purpose,
the amount of any "net Tax benefit" shall be computed assuming the Buyer
Group has recognized all other items for the relevant year of income, gain,
loss, deduction and credit before recognizing any item with respect to the
incurrence of any Loss. Any indemnification payment hereunder shall first be
computed without regard to any net Tax benefit that the Buyer Group is
entitled to claim with respect to the incurrence of the Loss and Sellers
shall be obligated to pay under Section 9.2 an amount computed as if no net
Tax benefit will be realized. Buyer then shall be obligated to remit to
Sellers the amount of any net Tax benefit it actually realizes within ten
(10) Business Days of the date for which a Tax Return for the Buyer Group is
filed claiming the net Tax benefit; provided, that the aggregate amount
of net Tax benefits paid with respect to any Loss shall not exceed the
indemnification payments made to Buyer with respect to such Loss. To the
extent that a net Tax benefit actually realized on a Tax Return and paid by
Buyer to Sellers is eventually disallowed by any Tax authority or
is otherwise permanently lost, such amount shall be treated as a Tax for
which Sellers are obligated to indemnify the Buyer under the terms of this
Agreement.    

 (c) Except with respect to a breach of Sellers representations, warranties or covenants set forth in _Section 3.5_, _Section 6.16_ or the last sentence in _Section 9.3(b)_, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (i) Sellers shall have no obligation or liability under _Section 9.2_, _Section 6.14_ or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, with respect to any Losses suffered by the Buyer Group, in the aggregate, in excess of the Warranties Escrow and (ii) the Warranties Escrow shall be the sole source of funds available to members of the Buyer Group from Sellers or their respective Affiliates with respect to any claim of indemnification or otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby following the Closing.   

 (d) At any time prior to the date which is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (the "Claim Period"), Buyer will have the right to notify Sellers in writing that Buyer is making a indemnification claim on behalf of the Buyer Group with respect to the Warranties Escrow covering the alleged breach of any surviving representation, warranty or covenant of a Seller. Such notice will specify the nature of the claim and the amount by which Buyer proposes to be paid out of the Warranties Escrow with respect to such claim. In the event Sellers dispute Buyers claim, Sellers will notify Buyer in writing thereof within ten (10) days after receipt of such notice. In the event Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days after receipt by Sellers of the notice of dispute, either Buyer or Sellers may submit such dispute to arbitration as provided in _Section 13.9_. In the event Sellers do not dispute such claim or upon resolution of any such disputes, Fund IX, on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer shall provide joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer the amount thereof, if any. Upon the expiration of the Claim Period without any pending claims, then, pursuant to joint written instructions by Fund IX, on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer, (a) the aggregate amount of all Target Bonus amounts (including, without limitation, the employer share of any employment related Taxes in respect thereof) under the Incentive Payment Agreements shall be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to Buyer and (b) the remaining balance of the Warranties Escrow will be disbursed by the Escrow Agent to Sellers, _pro rata_ , in accordance with the _pro_     ##### 

  

 

 _rata_ portion of the Purchase Price received by Sellers; provided, however,
that in the event that there are any pending claims (including any disputed
items with respect to the Final Settlement Statement pursuant to _Section
1.4_) at the time of such expiration: (1) the sum of (a) the claimed amounts
and (b) the aggregate amount of all Target Bonus amounts (including, without
limitation, the employer share of any employment related Taxes in respect
thereof) that would be payable under the Incentive Payment Agreements if all
of the outstanding claims were determined in favor of Sellers, shall remain
in escrow; (2) the remaining balance of the Warranties Escrow after
such retention will be so disbursed by Escrow Agent (pursuant to joint
written instructions by Fund IX, on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer) to Sellers,
_pro rata_ , in accordance with the _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase Price
received by Sellers; (3) as each such claim is resolved, any amount
retained with respect thereto that remains in escrow after such resolution
will be disbursed by Escrow Agent (pursuant to joint written instructions by
Fund IX, on behalf of Sellers, and Buyer) to Sellers,  _pro rata_ , in
accordance with the _pro rata_ portion of the Purchase Price received by
Sellers or to the Buyer in accordance with the determination of such claim
and (4) after all such claims are determined, then, pursuant to joint written
instructions by Fund IX, on behalf of the Sellers, and Buyer, (a) the
aggregate amount of all Target Bonus amounts (including, without limitation,
the employer share of any employment related Taxes in respect thereof) under
the Incentive Payment Agreements shall be disbursed by Escrow Agent to Buyer
and (b) the remaining balance of the Warranties Escrow will be disbursed by
the Escrow Agent to Sellers, _pro rata_ , in accordance with the _pro rata_
portion of the Purchase Price received by Sellers.    

 (e) In determining whether there has occurred a breach of the representations or warranties by Sellers contained in _Article III_ or _IV_ , as well as Sellers liability under  _Section 9.2_ for any Losses resulting therefrom, any materiality qualifiers in Sellers representations or warranties, including without limitation, a Material Adverse Effect, shall be disregarded for all purposes.   

 (f) In the event of any conflict between _Section 9.3_ and _Section 9.4_, with respect to Sellers indemnification obligations, this _Section 9.3_ shall control.    ##### 

  

  

 9.4 _Indemnification Procedure_.   

 (a) If a claim arises (an "Indemnity Claim") for which a party may have an obligation of indemnity under this _Article IX_ or elsewhere under this Agreement (such party, the "Indemnitor"), the Person entitled to such indemnity (the "Indemnitee") shall give the Indemnitor written notice of such claim setting forth the particulars associated with the claim (including a copy of the written underlying claim of a Third Party, if any) as then known by the Indemnitee ("Indemnity Claim Notice"). Where the underlying claim involves a claim by a Third Party (a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnitee shall, to the extent practicable, deliver an Indemnity Claim Notice to the Indemnitor within such time as will allow the Indemnitor a reasonable period in which to evaluate and timely respond to the underlying claim; provided, however, that (i) failure to do so shall not affect an Indemnitees rights hereunder except for, and only to the extent of, any incremental increase in the cost of the Indemnity Claim resulting from the failure to give notice. The delivery of an Indemnity Claim Notice shall not extend the time period set forth in _Section 9.3_ or _Article X _(as applicable to the claim), but if an Indemnity Claim Notice is given to an Indemnitor within the applicable time period (if any) with respect to such claim set forth in _Section 9.3_ or _Article X_, such Indemnity Claim Notice shall be effective, subject to the other limitations in _Section 9.3_ (if applicable), as to costs and expenses incurred or suffered after the expiration of any such time period, with respect to the matter described in such Indemnity Claim Notice.   

 (b) Upon receipt of an Indemnity Claim Notice involving a Third Party Claim for which an Indemnitor believes it may have an obligation of indemnity under this Agreement, the Indemnitor shall, if it so elects in accordance with this _Section 9.4_ (without prejudice to its right to contest its obligation of indemnity under this Agreement), assume the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnitor, and the Indemnitee shall cooperate in all reasonable respects; provided, however, that the Indemnitor will not have the authority to subject the Indemnitee to any obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense. If any Third Party Claim involves a fact pattern wherein each Party may have an obligation to indemnify the other Party, each Party may assume the defense of and hire counsel for that portion of the Third Party Claim for which it may have an obligation of indemnity. In all instances, the Indemnitee may employ separate counsel and participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim; provided, however, if the Indemnitor has assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ and has agreed to indemnify the Indemnitee, the fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee shall be borne solely by the Indemnitee. If (a) the underlying Third Party Claim plus all previously asserted Indemnity Claims have exceeded the Threshold Amount, if applicable in the circumstances, and (b) the Indemnitor elects by written notice to undertake the defense of the Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Indemnity Claim Notice, then (i) the Indemnitor shall defend the Indemnitee against such Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnitor shall pay any judgment entered or settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim, (iii) the Indemnitor shall not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim that (A) does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Indemnitee from all liability with respect to such Third Party Claim, and (B) would restrict such Indemnitees ability to conduct its business in the ordinary    ##### 

  

 

course and (iv) the Indemnitee shall not consent to the entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party Claim without
the Indemnitors prior written consent. If the Indemnitor has not elected to
undertake the defense of a Third Party Claim, or if the Indemnitor assumes
the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section 9.4_ but fails
to diligently defend against the Third Party Claim within thirty (30) days
following any written notice from such Indemnitee asserting such failure,
then the Indemnitee shall have the right to defend, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnitor (to the extent the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification hereunder), the Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings. In such instances, the Indemnitee shall have full control of
such defense and proceedings. The Indemnitor may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement controlled by an Indemnitee pursuant to
this _Section 9.4_, and the Indemnitor shall bear its own costs and expenses
with respect to such participation. Notwithstanding the other provisions of
this  _Section 9.4_, if the Indemnitor disputes its potential liability to
the Indemnitee under this _Section 9.4_ and if such dispute is resolved in
favor of the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor shall not be required to bear the
costs and expenses of the Indemnitees defense pursuant to this  _Section
9.4_. The party controlling the defense of the proceedings agrees to afford
the other relevant party and its counsel the opportunity to be present at
conferences with all Persons, including Governmental Entities, asserting any
Indemnity Claim or conferences with representatives of or counsel for such
Persons. The Indemnitor shall pay to the Indemnitee in immediately available
funds any amounts to which the Indemnitee is entitled under this _Article IX_
as agreed to by the parties or as decided by arbitration pursuant to _Section
13.9_, such payment to be made within fifteen (15) days after any such
amounts are determined in accordance with this Agreement.    

 9.5 _Waiver of Certain Damages_. Each of the parties expressly waives and agrees not to, and to cause its Affiliates not to seek indirect, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages or damages for lost profits of any kind with respect to any dispute arising under, related to, or in connection with this Agreement, the breach hereof or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent any party or its/his Affiliate suffers such damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending against such damages) to a Third Party in connection with a claim by a Third Party, which damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorneys fees incurred in connection with defending against such damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to the recovery hereunder.   

 9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. If Closing occurs, the express indemnities set forth in _Article IX_ and elsewhere in this Agreement shall be the exclusive remedies for the parties for the breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement or any claim arising out of, resulting from or related to the transactions contemplated hereby, and, except for such remedies, each of Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, hereby releases, waives and discharges, and covenants not to sue (and shall cause its Affiliates to release, waive, discharge and covenant not to sue) the other party(ies) or its/their Affiliates and all such parties stockholders, partners, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives with respect to, any cause of action or Losses, including claims under state or federal securities Laws and Claims available at common Law, in equity or by statute known or unknown, which the releasing party(ies) or its/their respective Affiliates have, based on, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the ownership, use or operation of the Purchased Companies, the Cenestia Partnerships or the Pine Mountain Assets, excluding, however, any rights existing under (a) the Incentive Payment Agreements or (b) the Vandenberg Agreements.    ##### 

  

  

 9.7 _Express Negligence_. Without limiting or enlarging the scope of the indemnification and release provisions set forth in this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, such provisions shall be applicable regardless of whether the liabilities, Losses, costs, expenses and damages in question arises out of or results from the sole, active, passive, concurrent or comparative negligence, strict liability or other fault or violation of any Law of or by any Indemnitee or released Person.   

 9.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments pursuant to this _Article IX_ or _Article VI_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price. In addition, any amount distributed to Buyer in respect of any Target Bonus amounts pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

Gratham, Charles Ian Landon (collectively, "Sellers") and Buyer have entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of November ___, 2004 (the "Purchase Agreement"), pursuant to which, among other things, Buyer acquired certain equity interests from Sellers and a portion of the amount payable at the closing thereunder was to be withheld and deposited in escrow pending certain post-closing settlement procedures (the parties acknowledge that Escrow Agent is not a party to, has not received and will not be responsible for the Purchase Agreement); and   

 WHEREAS, First Reserve is (and will be) acting on behalf of all Sellers as it is authorized to do under the Purchase Agreement; and   

 WHEREAS, First Reserve and Buyer have requested the Bank to act in the capacity of escrow agent under this Escrow Agreement, and the Bank, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, has agreed so to do.   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:   

 1. _Appointment of Escrow Agent._ Each of First Reserve and Buyer hereby appoints the Bank as the escrow agent under this Escrow Agreement (the Bank, in such capacity, the "Escrow Agent"), and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment.   

 2. _Deposit._ Upon execution of this Escrow Agreement, Buyer will deliver to the Escrow Agent the sum of [12.5% of the Purchase Price] (as said amount may increase or decrease from time to time as a result of the investment and reinvestment thereof, the "Deposit") to be held by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms hereof. Subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, the Escrow Agent agrees that it shall receive, hold in escrow, invest and reinvest and release or distribute the Deposit from time to    ##### 

  

  

time provided by this Escrow Agreement. It is hereby expressly stipulated and
agreed that all interest and other earnings on the Deposit shall become a
part of the Deposit for all purposes, and that all losses resulting from the
investment or reinvestment thereof from time to time shall from the time of
such loss no longer constitute part of the Deposit. Title to the Deposit shall
remain in Buyer until such funds are released and consistent with the
foregoing Buyer shall be deemed the owner of the Deposit pursuant to Proposed
Treas. Reg. Section 1.468B-8(c).   

 3. _Investment of the Deposit._ The Escrow Agent shall invest and reinvest the Deposit in the JPMorgan Money Market Account, or in Permitted Investments (as defined below). The Escrow Agent may use a broker-dealer of its own selection, including a broker-dealer owned by or affiliated with the Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates. The Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive compensation with respect to any investment directed hereunder (provided that such compensation shall be disclosed in writing to the Other Parties prior to such investment). The Escrow Agent shall have the right to liquidate any investment held in order to release the Deposit from time to time as provided by this Escrow Agreement. It is expressly agreed and understood by the parties hereto that the Escrow Agent shall not in any way whatsoever be liable for losses on any investments, including, but not limited to, losses from market risks due to premature liquidation or resulting from other actions taken pursuant to and consistent with this Escrow Agreement. For purposes of this Escrow Agreement, "Permitted Investments" shall mean direct obligations of the U.S. government, obligations guaranteed by the U.S. government and money market funds that invest solely in direct obligations of the U.S. government or in obligations guaranteed by the U.S. government. Unless otherwise instructed in writing by Buyer and First Reserve, the Escrow Agent will invest the Deposit in a JPMorgan Money Market Account.   

 The Escrow Agent will provide to First Reserve and Buyer monthly statements setting forth the cash balance currently held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, and detailing all releases, payments, reimbursements or other disbursements made hereunder. Receipt, investment and reinvestment of the Deposit shall be confirmed by the Escrow Agent as soon as practicable following each such transaction by account statement to the Other Parties, and any discrepancies in any such account statement shall be noted by the Other Parties to the Escrow Agent within 30 calendar days after receipt thereof. Failure to inform the Escrow Agent in writing of any discrepancies in any such account statement within said 30-day period shall presumptively be deemed confirmation of such account statement in its entirety. For purposes of this paragraph, (a) each account statement shall be deemed to have been received by the party to whom directed on the earlier to occur of (i) actual receipt thereof and (ii) five (5) Business Days (hereinafter defined) after the deposit thereof in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, to the address for such party set forth in this Escrow Agreement or otherwise provided by such party to Escrow Agent in writing and (b) the term "Business Day" shall mean any day of the year, excluding Saturday, Sunday and any other day on which national banks are required or authorized to close in Houston, Texas.   

 4. _Disbursement of Deposit._ The Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to make disbursements of the Deposit only as follows:    ##### 

  

  

 (a) in accordance with joint written instructions signed by both First Reserve and Buyer and in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Joint Notice");   

 (b) if there is any question as to any partys entitlement to the Deposit, the Escrow Agent shall continue to hold the Deposit in accordance with the terms of this Escrow Agreement until (i) receipt of a Joint Notice or (ii) the question of any partys entitlement to the Deposit shall have been determined by arbitration pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (a "Final Determination");   

 (c) promptly upon receipt by the Escrow Agent of a Final Determination but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter, to First Reserve or Buyer as specified in such Final Determination; or   

 (d) into the registry of a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Sections 9 or 16 hereof, as applicable.   

 Buyer and First Reserve agree that, within fifteen days after the end of each calendar quarter, forty percent (40%) of any income earned on the Deposit (whether interest or otherwise) during the immediately preceding calendar quarter shall be distributed to Buyer so that Buyer may meet the tax obligations imposed on Buyer by this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the final distribution of the Deposit, Buyer and First Reserve agree that forty percent (40%) of any income earned on the Deposit (whether interest or otherwise) from the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter through the date of the final distribution shall be distributed to Buyer so that Buyer may meet the tax obligations imposed on Buyer by this Agreement.   

 5. _Amounts Distributed or Earned._ All amounts earned with respect to the Deposit (whether interest or otherwise) shall become a part of the Deposit and shall be held under the same terms as the Deposit initially delivered to the Escrow Agent hereunder. Amounts earned with respect to the Deposit shall be paid at the time of any disbursement hereunder to the party receiving such disbursement in accordance with the applicable provision of Section 4.   

 6. _Tax Matters._ Buyer shall be treated as the owner of the Deposit pursuant to Proposed Treas. Reg. Section 1.468B-8(c) and Buyer shall take into account all items of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to the Deposit for federal, state and local income tax purposes until the Deposit is released from escrow and paid to the receiving party (the "Receiving Party"). Upon release of all or a portion of the Deposit from escrow, the Receiving Party of such Deposit or portion thereof shall be individually liable for payment (and shall indemnify the other parties for losses incurred by the Receiving Partys nonpayment) of all taxes payable with respect to such Deposit or portion thereof received and all related tax reporting duties. Buyer and First Reserve shall provide the Escrow Agent with its taxpayer identification number documented by an appropriate Form W-8 or Form W-9 and First Reserve shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Escrow Agent with an appropriate Form W-8 or Form W-9 for each of the other Sellers, upon or as soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Escrow Agreement. Failure so to provide such forms may prevent or delay disbursements from the Deposit and may also result in the assessment of a penalty and the Escrow    ##### 

  

  

Agents being required to withhold tax on any interest or other income earned
on the Deposit. Any payments of income shall be subject to applicable
withholding regulations then in force in the United States or any other
jurisdiction, as applicable. Pursuant to Proposed Treas. Reg.
Section 1.468B-8(g), for each calendar year (or portion thereof) from the
date of this Escrow Agreement until the release of the Deposit, the Escrow
Agent shall report the income on the Deposit on any required IRS information
return or reporting form showing the Escrow Agent as payor and Buyer
as payee.   

 7 _. Scope of Undertaking. _The Escrow Agents duties and responsibilities in connection with this Escrow Agreement shall be purely ministerial and shall be limited to those expressly set forth in this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent is not a principal, participant or beneficiary in any transaction underlying this Escrow Agreement and shall have no duty to inquire beyond the terms and provisions hereof. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or obligation of any kind in connection with this Escrow Agreement or the Deposit and shall not be required to deliver the Deposit or any part thereof or take any action with respect to any matters that might arise in connection therewith, other than to receive, hold, invest, reinvest and deliver the Deposit as herein provided. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is hereby expressly agreed and stipulated by the parties hereto that the Escrow Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion hereunder and shall have no investment or management responsibility and, accordingly, shall have no duty to, or liability for its failure to, provide investment recommendations or investment advice to the Other Parties or either of them. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error in judgment, any act or omission, any mistake of law or fact, or for anything it may do or refrain from doing in connection herewith, except for, subject to Section 8 hereof, its own fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or material breach of this Escrow Agreement. It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Escrow Agent shall never be required to use, advance or risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or the exercise of any of its rights and powers hereunder.   

 8. _Reliance; Liability._ The Escrow Agent may rely on, and shall not be liable for acting or refraining from acting in accordance with, any written notice, instruction or request or other paper furnished to it hereunder or pursuant hereto and reasonably believed by it in good faith to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall be responsible for holding, investing, reinvesting and disbursing the Deposit pursuant to this Escrow Agreement; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, indirect or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such damage and regardless of the form of action, and _provided, further,_ that the Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any loss arising from any cause beyond its control, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) acts of God, force majeure, including, without limitation, war (whether or not declared or existing), revolution, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, accident, fire, explosion, stoppage of labor, strikes and other differences with employees; (b) the act, failure or neglect of any Other Party, (c) the act, failure or neglect of any agent or correspondent or any other person selected by the Escrow Agent (unless such selection involved fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct); (d) any delay, error, omission or default of any mail, courier, telegraph, cable or wireless agency or operator; or    ##### 

  

  

(e) the acts or edicts of any government or governmental agency or other group
or entity exercising governmental powers. The Escrow Agent is not responsible
or liable in any manner whatsoever for the transaction or transactions
requiring or underlying the execution of this Escrow Agreement or for the
identity or authority of any person (other than the Escrow Agent)
executing this Escrow Agreement or any part hereof or depositing the
Deposit.   

 9. _Right of Interpleader._ Should any controversy arise involving the parties hereto or any of them or any other person, firm or entity with respect to this Escrow Agreement or the Deposit, or should a substitute escrow agent fail to be designated as provided in Section 16 hereof, or if the Escrow Agent should be in doubt as to what action to take, the Escrow Agent shall have the right, but not the obligation, either to (a) withhold delivery of the Deposit until the controversy is resolved, the conflicting demands are withdrawn or its doubt is resolved or (b) institute a petition for interpleader in a court of competent jurisdiction to determine the rights of the parties hereto and pay into such court all applicable funds held by the Escrow Agent for holding and disbursement. Should a petition for interpleader be instituted, or should the Escrow Agent be threatened with litigation or become involved in litigation or binding arbitration in any manner whatsoever in connection with this Escrow Agreement or the Deposit, the Other Parties hereby jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Escrow Agent for its reasonable attorneys fees and any and all other reasonable and documented expenses, losses, costs and damages incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with or resulting from such threatened or actual litigation prior to any disbursement hereunder (other than any such threatened or actual litigation that results from a material breach by the Escrow Agent of this Escrow Agreement or the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of the Escrow Agent).   

 10. _Indemnification._ The Other Parties hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify the Escrow Agent, its officers, directors, partners, employees and agents (each hereinafter referred to as an "Indemnified Party") against, and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from, any and all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, losses, costs, damages and claims, including, but not limited to, costs of investigation, litigation, tax liability suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with or arising from or out of this Escrow Agreement, except such acts or omissions as may result from the fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of, or material breach of this Escrow Agreement by, such Indemnified Party. IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENT OF EACH OF FIRST RESERVE AND BUYER TO INDEMNIFY EACH OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FOR, AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST, FIRST RESERVES OR BUYERS NEGLIGENT ACTS OR OMISSIONS. If any action or proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Party with respect to which indemnity may be sought from the Other Parties pursuant to this section, or an Indemnified Party receives notice from any potential claimant, such Indemnified Party shall, as promptly as practicable after receiving notice thereof, give written notice to the Other Parties of the commencement of such action or proceeding or of the existence of any such claim (any such action, proceeding or notice hereinafter referred to as a "Claim") and furnish the Other Parties with copies of any summons or other legal process received by such Indemnified Party and other documents and information in the possession of such Indemnified Party as to the nature and basis of the claim; _provided,_ that no failure to    ##### 

  

  

give or delay in giving such notice or such documents and information shall
relieve the Other Parties from any of their indemnification obligations
hereunder except to the extent such obligations could have been reduced or
avoided in the absence of such failure or delay. In case any such Claim shall
be brought against any Indemnified Party, the Other Parties will be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Claim, and, after written
notice from the Other Parties to such Indemnified Party, to jointly assume
the defense of such Claim with a single counsel mutually agreed upon and
appointed by the Other Parties and which counsel is reasonably acceptable to
such Indemnified Party at the Other Parties joint expense or, alternatively,
if only one, but not both, of the Other Parties elects to assume the defense
of such Claim, then such party will, after written notice to the non-electing
Other Party and such Indemnified Party, be entitled to defend such Claim
separately with the cost of such defense to be shared equally by the Other
Parties (in each case the Other Parties shall not thereafter be responsible
for the fees and disbursements of any separate counsel retained by such
Indemnified Party in connection with such action or proceeding, except as
provided below in this paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Other Parties shall jointly assume the defense of any Claim against any
Indemnified Party, such defense shall be jointly controlled by the Other
Parties and all decisions relating thereto shall be mutually agreed upon by
the Other Parties. If only one of the Other Parties shall elect to assume the
defense of any Claim separately, such party shall obtain the prior written
consent of (i) the non-electing Other Party before entering into any
settlement of such Claim if the settlement imposes any cost, expense or
obligation on the non-electing Other Party or does not expressly
and unconditionally release the non-electing Other Party from all liabilities
and obligations with respect to such Claim and (ii) the Indemnified Party if
the settlement imposes any cost, expense or obligation on the Indemnified
Party or does not expressly and unconditionally release the Indemnified Party
from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Claim.
Notwithstanding any election by the Other Parties to assume the defense of
any such Claim, such Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ
separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such Claim at the
Indemnified Partys expense; _provided, however,_ that such Indemnified Party
shall not have the right to settle any such Claim without the prior written
consent of the Other Parties. The Other Parties agree to pay the reasonable
and documented fees and disbursements of such separate counsel only if (i)
the use of counsel jointly chosen by the Other Parties to represent such
Indemnified Party would present an actual conflict of interest which it would
be unreasonable to waive or (ii) the Other Parties shall authorize such
Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at the Other Parties joint
expense. If the Other Parties do not elect, jointly or separately, to assume
the defense of a Claim against any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party
shall obtain the prior written consent of the Other Parties before entering
into any settlement of such Claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 9 or in this Section 10, the Other Parties agree, as
between themselves, to share in the aggregate amount of any reimbursable
costs pursuant to Section 9 or indemnifiable costs pursuant to this Section
10 for which any Indemnified Party may be liable in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect their respective relative fault in connection with the
acts or omissions which resulted in such costs. The relative fault of
First Reserve and Buyer shall be determined by reference to  whether the
acts or omissions at issue were those of First Reserve or Buyer respectively.
If any amount paid by First Reserve or Buyer pursuant to this Section 10 is
in excess of the amount allocable to it in accordance with the provisions of
this section, it    ##### 

  

     

shall be entitled to reimbursement of such excess amount (plus all reasonable
attorneys fees and documented expenses incurred in connection with enforcing
this provision) from the other.   

 11. _Compensation and Reimbursement of Expenses._ Upon execution of this Escrow Agreement, the Buyer and First Reserve shall each pay one-half of the Escrow Agents fee for services hereunder in accordance with the Escrow Agents fee schedule as attached as Schedule I hereto. In addition, each of Buyer and First Reserve agree to pay one-half of all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its duties and enforcement of its rights hereunder and otherwise in connection with the operation, administration and enforcement of this Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, attorneys fees, brokerage costs and related expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent, in each case to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with such performance (collectively, "Other Expenses"). Buyer and First Reserve shall be jointly and severally liable to the Escrow Agent for the payment of all Other Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and First Reserve shall not be responsible for any Other Expenses to the extent such expenses arise out of, relate to or result from the Escrow Agents material breach of this Escrow Agreement or the gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud of the Escrow Agent. In the even the Other Parties for any reason fail to pay any such fees and expenses as and when the same are due, such unpaid fees and expenses shall be charged to and set-off and paid from the Deposit by Escrow Agent without any further notice.   

 12. _Funds Transfer._ All disbursements of the Deposit shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available U.S. Federal Funds to an account or accounts designated by the payee therefor. In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing at the time of execution of this Escrow Agreement), whether in writing, by telefax, or otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or persons designated on Schedule II hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. If the Escrow Agent is unable to contact any of the authorized representatives identified in Schedule II, the Escrow Agent is hereby authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of your executive officers, ("Executive Officers"), which shall include (a) in the case of Buyer, the titles of Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President Corporate Development and (b) in the case of First Reserve, the titles of Vice President, Manager or Director, as the Escrow Agent may select. Such "Executive Officer" shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed Incumbency Certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any such officer. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in writing actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent. The parties to this Escrow Agreement acknowledge that such security procedure is commercially reasonable.   

 It is understood that the Escrow Agent and the beneficiarys bank in any funds transfer may rely solely upon any account numbers or similar identifying number provided by either of the Other Parties hereto to identify (i) the beneficiary, (ii) the beneficiarys bank, or (iii) an intermediary bank. The Escrow Agent may apply any of the escrowed funds for any payment order it executes using any such identifying number, even where its use may    ##### 

  

  

result in a person other than the beneficiary being paid, or the transfer of
funds to a bank other than the beneficiarys bank or an intermediary bank,
designated.   

 13. _Notices._ Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given under this Escrow Agreement by any party hereto to any other party hereto shall be considered as properly given if in writing and (a) delivered against receipt therefor, (b) mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid or (c) sent by telefax machine, in each case to the address or telefax number, as the case may be, set forth below:

the parties to this Escrow Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile, and
such facsimile will, for all purposes, be deemed to be the original signature
of such party whose signature it reproduces, and will be binding upon such
party.   

 14. _Consultation with Legal Counsel._ The Escrow Agent may consult with its counsel or other counsel satisfactory to it concerning any question relating to its duties or responsibilities hereunder or otherwise in connection herewith and shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith upon the advice of such counsel.   

 15. _Choice of Laws; Cumulative Rights; Jurisdiction._ All of the Escrow Agents rights hereunder are cumulative of any other rights it may have at law, in equity or otherwise. This Escrow Agreement shall be construed and enforced in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Texas.   

 16. _Resignation._ The Escrow Agent may resign hereunder upon thirty (30) days prior notice to the Other Parties. Upon the effective date of such resignation, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit to any substitute escrow agent designated by the Other Parties in writing. If the Other Parties fail to designate a substitute escrow agent within thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice, the Escrow Agent may institute a petition for interpleader. The Escrow Agents sole responsibility after such 30-day notice period expires shall be to hold the Deposit (without any obligation to reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow agent, if any, or in accordance with the directions of a final order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction at which time of delivery the Escrow Agents obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate. The Escrow Agent or successor agent shall continue to act as escrow agent hereunder until a successor is appointed and qualified to act as the escrow agent.   

 17. _Termination by Buyer and First Reserve._ By mutual agreement, Buyer and First Reserve shall have the right at any time upon not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to the Escrow Agent to terminate their appointment of the Escrow Agent as the escrow agent, or any successor escrow agent, as escrow agent hereunder.

and qualified to act as the escrow agent.   

 18. _Assignment._ Neither First Reserve nor Buyer shall have the right to assign this Escrow Agreement or any of their respective rights or obligations hereunder (by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other and any attempted assignment without the required consent of such other party shall be void.   

 19. _Severability._ If one or more of the provisions hereof shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under applicable law, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof, and this Escrow Agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein, and the remaining provisions hereof shall be given full force and effect.   

 20. _Termination._ This Escrow Agreement shall terminate upon the disbursement, in accordance with Sections 4 or 16 hereof, of the Deposit in full; _provided, however,_ that in the event all fees, expenses, costs and other amounts required to be paid to the Escrow Agent hereunder are not fully and finally paid prior to termination, the provisions of Sections 9 and 10 hereof and the last two sentences of Section 8 hereof shall survive the termination hereof.   

 21. _Waiver of Offset Rights._ Except as set forth in the last sentence of Section 11 hereof, Escrow Agent hereby waives any and all rights to offset that it may have against the Deposit including, without limitation, claims arising as a result of any claims, amounts, liabilities, costs, expenses, damages, or other losses that Escrow Agent may be otherwise entitled to collect from any party to this Escrow Agreement.   

 22. _General._ The section headings contained in this Escrow Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Escrow Agreement. This Escrow Agreement and any affidavit, certificate, instrument, agreement or other document required to be provided hereunder may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. Unless the context shall otherwise require, the singular shall include the plural and vice-versa, and each pronoun in any gender shall include all other genders. The terms and provisions of this Escrow Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto in respect of the subject matter hereof, and neither the Other Parties nor the Escrow Agent has relied on any representations or agreements of the other, except as specifically set forth in this Escrow Agreement. This Escrow Agreement or any provision hereof may be amended, modified, waived or terminated only by written instrument duly signed by the parties hereto. This Escrow Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the parties hereto and their respective heirs, devisees, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors, trustees, receivers and permitted assigns. This Escrow Agreement is for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Sellers, the Buyer and the Escrow Agent, and nothing in this Escrow Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer or shall be construed as conferring upon any other person any rights, remedies or any other type or types of benefits. If performance by any party to this Escrow Agreement is delayed or prevented by any act of God, terrorism, fire, flood or other casualty, strike, national emergency or other cause beyond the reasonable control of a party, then the period    ##### 

  

  

of such partys performance of the applicable obligation shall be
automatically extended for the same amount of time that such party is so
delayed or hindered. The affected party shall use its best efforts to remove
the cause of delay and shall notify the other parties to this
Escrow Agreement in writing of any such delay or failure promptly after the
commencement of the event relied upon for its delay or failure to comply with
its obligations.

LEGAL EXPENSES:

  |   |   |   | At Cost  
   

   

There will be no legal expense for Chase if Chases standard form escrow
agreement is employed without substantive amendments.    ##### 

  

     

A New Account Acceptance Fee will be charged for the Banks review of the
Escrow Agreement along with any related account documentation. A one (1) year
Minimum Administrative Fee will be assessed for any account which is funded.
The account will be invoiced in the month in which the account is opened and
annually thereafter. Payment of the invoice is due 30 days following
receipt.   

The Administrative Fee will cover a maximum of fifteen (15) annual
administrative hours for the Banks standard Escrow services including
account setup, safekeeping of assets, investment of funds, collection of
income and other receipts, preparation of statements comprising
account activity and asset listing, and distribution of assets in accordance
with the specific terms of the Escrow Agreement.   

 _Extraordinary Services and Out-of Pocket Expenses:_    

Any additional services beyond our standard services as specified above, such
as annual administrative activities in excess of fifteen (15) hours and all
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses including attorneys fees will be
considered extraordinary services for which related costs, transaction
charges, and additional fees will be billed at the Banks standard rate.   

 _Modification of Fees:_    

Circumstances may arise necessitating a change in the foregoing fee schedule.
The Bank will attempt at all times, however, to maintain the fees at a level
which is fair and reasonable in relation to the responsibilities assumed and
the duties performed.   

 _Assumptions:_    

       |    | The escrow deposit shall be continuously invested in a
JPMorgan Money Market Account. The Minimum Administrative Fee would include
_a supplemental charge of 50 basis points_ on the escrow deposit amount if
another investment option is chosen.  
---|---|--- 
      
     |    | The account will be invoiced in the month in which the
account is opened and annually thereafter.  
      
     |    | Payment of the invoice is due 30 days following receipt.  
    

 

   

All fees quoted are subject to our review and acceptance, and that of our
legal counsel, of the documents governing the escrow. As a condition for
acceptance of an appointment, it is expected that all legal fees and out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by JPMorgan Chase Bank and our counsel in connection
with our review of the transaction will be paid by the client regardless of
whether or not the transaction closes. 
  

   

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain,
verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an
account. When an account is opened, we will ask for information that
will allow us to identify relevant parties.    #####

Vandenberg ("Vandenberg"), Richard M. Brillhart ("Brillhart"), Jeremy H. Grantham ("Grantham"), Charles Ian Landon ("Landon") (Fund IX, RIT, Vandenberg, Brillhart, Grantham and Landon are collectively the "Beneficiary").   

RECITALS    

 Guarantor and the Beneficiary entered into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of November ___, 2004 (the "Agreement").   

 Pursuant to Section 13.3 of the Agreement, Guarantor is required to execute and deliver a guaranty in the form hereof to the Beneficiary in the event Guarantor elects to assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement to its Affiliate (as defined in the Agreement).   

 Guarantor has decided to assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement to its Affiliate _________(the "Assignee") and, therefore, is issuing this Guaranty to the Beneficiary.   

 NOW, THEREFORE, Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees with, and represents and warrants to, Beneficiary as follows:   

 1. _Defined Terms._ Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meaning given them in the Agreement.   

 2. _The Guaranty._ Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Beneficiary the full and timely performance, payment and discharge by Assignee of all obligations and liabilities (collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations") of Assignee and its Affiliates now existing or hereafter arising under the Agreement, as the same may be modified from time to time, and hereby agrees that if Assignee or any of its Affiliates shall fail to pay any amount when and as the same shall be due and payable by Assignee or any such Affiliate to Beneficiary or timely to perform and discharge in full any obligation or liability under and in accordance with the terms of the Agreement, Guarantor will forthwith pay to Beneficiary an amount equal to any such amount or perform and discharge or cause to be performed and discharged any such obligation or liability, as the case may be, as such payment or performance and discharge is required pursuant to the terms of the Agreement to be made or done by Assignee or its Affiliates, and will further pay all reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, that may be incurred by Beneficiary in enforcing the covenants and agreements of Guarantor herein. The guaranty in the preceding sentence is an absolute, present and continuing guaranty of payment and of performance of obligations and not of collectibility and is in no way    ##### 

  

  

conditional or contingent upon any attempt to collect from Assignee or its
Affiliates or upon any other action, occurrence or circumstance whatsoever.
It shall not be necessary for Beneficiary, in order to enforce such payment
by Guarantor, first to institute suit or exhaust its remedies against
Assignee, its Affiliates or any other Person liable with respect to the
Guaranteed Obligations.   

 3. _Obligations Absolute._ Subject to the provisions of Section 5, the obligations of Guarantor hereunder shall be primary, absolute, irrevocable and unconditional, irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Agreement, shall not be subject to any counterclaim, setoff, deduction or defense based upon any claim Guarantor may have against Assignee or its Affiliates or Beneficiary or otherwise, and to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall remain in full force and effect without regard to, and shall not be released, discharged or in any way affected by, any circumstance or condition whatsoever (whether or not Guarantor shall have any knowledge or notice thereof), including, without limitation:    

 (a) any amendment, modification of or supplement to the Agreement or any assignment or transfer of any rights or obligations thereunder;    

 (b) any release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, including as a result of a bankruptcy, insolvency, readjustment, composition with creditors, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding (each a "Bankruptcy Event"), of the performance or observance by Assignee or its Affiliates of any express or implied agreement, covenant, term, obligation or condition under the Agreement;    

 (c) any extension of the time for the payment of all or any portion of any sums payable under the Agreement or the extension of time for the performance of any obligations under the Agreement;    

 (d) any failure, omission, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Beneficiary, to enforce, assert or exercise, or any waiver of, any right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Beneficiary by the Agreement, or any action on the part of Beneficiary granting indulgence or extension of any kind;    

 (e) the taking (or subsequent release thereof) of security for the obligations of Assignee or its Affiliates under the Agreement;    

 (f) any Bankruptcy Event with respect to Assignee or its Affiliates or their respective property;    

 (g) any change in the corporate structure, existence or ownership of Guarantor, Assignee or its Affiliates or Beneficiary, including without limitation, any merger, amalgamation or consolidation of Guarantor, Assignee or its Affiliates or Beneficiary into or with any other corporation, limited liability company or partnership, or any sale, lease or transfer of any or all of the assets of Guarantor, Assignee or its Affiliates or Beneficiary to any Person;    ##### 

  

   

 (h) any failure on the part of Assignee or its Affiliates for any reason to comply with or perform any of the terms of any other agreement with Guarantor;    

 (i) any failure to perfect or maintain the perfection of any lien on or security interest in any collateral securing, at any time, performance of the obligations of Assignee or its Affiliates under the Agreement;    

 (j) the settlement or compromise of any Guaranteed Obligations;    

 (k) any law now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of the terms of the Agreement or the rights of Beneficiary with respect thereto; or    

 (l) any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor.   

 4. _Waiver._ Subject to the provisions of Section 5, Guarantor unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (a) notice of acceptance hereof, of any action taken or omitted in reliance hereon and of any defaults by Assignee or its Affiliates in the payment or performance of any Guaranteed Obligations, and of any of the matters referred to in section 3 hereof; (b) all notices that may otherwise be required by statute, rule of law or otherwise to preserve any of the rights of Beneficiary against Guarantor, including, without limitation, presentment to or demand for payment from Assignee or its Affiliates or Guarantor, notice to Assignee or its Affiliates or to Guarantor of default or protest for nonpayment or dishonor, and the filing of claims with a court in the event of the bankruptcy of Assignee or its Affiliates; (c) any right to the enforcement, assertion or exercise by Beneficiary of any right, power or remedy conferred in this Guaranty or the Agreement; (d) any requirement of diligence on the part of Beneficiary; and (e) any other act or omission (including any delay by Beneficiary in the taking of any action) that might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Guarantor or that might otherwise operate as a discharge of Guarantor. Guarantor waives any right to require Beneficiary to proceed against any additional or substitute guarantors or to pursue or exhaust any security provided by Assignee or its Affiliates, Guarantor or any other Person or to pursue any other remedy available to Beneficiary.   

 5. _Scope._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to Section 3(a) through Section 3(l), in connection with the enforcement of this Guaranty and Guarantors obligations hereunder, Guarantor shall be entitled to all defenses (other than a Bankruptcy Event) that Guarantor would have under the Agreement if Guarantor were the "Buyer" under the Agreement.   

 6. _Subrogation._ Guarantor will not exercise any rights that it may have acquired by way of subrogation under this Guaranty, by any payment made hereunder or otherwise, or accept any payment on account of such subrogation rights, or any rights of reimbursement or indemnity or any rights or recourse to any security for this Guaranty, unless and until all of the obligations, undertakings and conditions to be performed or observed by Assignee or its Affiliates under the Agreement at the time of Guarantors exercise of any such right shall have been performed, observed or paid in full.    ##### 

  

  

 7. _Reinstatement of Guaranty._ This Guaranty shall continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if and to the extent at any time any payments, in whole or in part, made by Assignee or its Affiliates or Guarantor to Beneficiary in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned by Beneficiary upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of Assignee or its Affiliates, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or other officer with similar powers with respect to Assignee or its Affiliates or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had not been made. Beneficiary shall not be required to litigate or otherwise dispute its obligation to make such repayments if it in good faith believes that such obligation exists.
