notice on or prior to the Defect Notice Date of any claimed Title Defect (each such Title Defect is
referred to as a &#147;<B>Pre-Closing Title Defect</B>&#148;). To be effective, each such notice shall set forth
(a)&nbsp;a description of the matter constituting the claimed Pre-Closing Title Defect, and (b)&nbsp;the

Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to cure any claimed Pre-Closing Title Defect

Pre-Closing Title Defects will be made unless the aggregate adjustments for all Pre-Closing Title
Defects exceed $2,000,000 (the &#147;<B>Title Threshold</B>&#148;), but if such Title Threshold is met, the

December&nbsp;10, 2004 to a title attorney selected by Sellers and Buyer (such title attorney
hereinafter, &#147;<B>Title Expert</B>&#148;). The Title Expert will have expertise in title matters in the State
in which the Pine Mountain Asset affected by the Title Defect in dispute is located and the costs

Buyer will each present the Title Expert a written statement of its position on the defect and/or
adjustment in question not later than the third (3rd) day after the dispute has been submitted to
the Title Expert. By the third (3rd) day following the submission of a matter to a Title Expert,
the Title Expert shall make a determination of the dispute, choosing either Sellers&#146; position or

capital Taxes, the period for which the payment of any such Tax provides the right to do business
will determine the taxable period (<I>e.g.</I>, a state franchise tax payable for the right to do business
for the calendar year 2002 is a Tax for the taxable period January&nbsp;1, 2002 through December&nbsp;31,
2002).

failures) would not result in a loss in excess of the Materiality Threshold, then Buyer will notify
Sellers of Buyer&#146;s estimate of the loss in value due to such failure. Sellers and Buyer shall use
their reasonable efforts to agree upon the amount of any such loss in value and the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the agreed upon amount and Buyer and Sellers shall proceed with Closing. If

any and all written instructions given to &#147;the Escrow Agent&#148; (hereinafter defined) pursuant hereto,
this &#147;Escrow Agreement&#148;) is made and entered into as of December&#95;&#95;&#95;, 2004 by and among First
Reserve Fund IX, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (&#147;First Reserve&#148;), Range Resources
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Buyer&#148;, and together with First Reserve, sometimes referred
to herein collectively as the &#147;Other Parties&#148;), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., a national
association with an office in Houston, Harris County, Texas (the &#147;Bank&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>W I T N E S S E T H:</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, First Reserve, Robertson Investment Trust LLC, Donald E. Vandenberg, Richard M.
Brillhart, Jeremy H. Gratham, Charles Ian Landon (collectively, &#147;Sellers&#148;) and Buyer have entered
into that certain Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of November &#95;&#95;&#95;, 2004 (the &#147;Purchase
Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which, among other things, Buyer acquired certain equity interests from
Sellers and a portion of the amount payable at the closing thereunder was to be withheld and
deposited in escrow pending certain post-closing settlement procedures (the parties acknowledge
that Escrow Agent is not a party to, has not received and will not be responsible for the Purchase
Agreement); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, First Reserve is (and will be) acting on behalf of all Sellers as it is authorized to
do under the Purchase Agreement; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>WHEREAS</B>, First Reserve and Buyer have requested the Bank to act in the capacity of escrow
agent under this Escrow Agreement, and the Bank, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, has
agreed so to do.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>NOW, THEREFORE</B>, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and agreements contained
herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;<I>Appointment of Escrow Agent. </I>Each of First Reserve and Buyer hereby appoints the Bank as
the escrow agent under this Escrow Agreement (the Bank, in such capacity, the &#147;Escrow Agent&#148;), and
the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;<I>Deposit. </I>Upon execution of this Escrow Agreement, Buyer will deliver to the Escrow Agent
the sum of &#091;12.5% of the Purchase Price&#093; (as said amount may increase or decrease from time to time
as a result of the investment and reinvestment thereof, the &#147;Deposit&#148;) to be held by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms hereof. Subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof, the Escrow Agent agrees that it shall receive, hold in escrow, invest and
reinvest and release or distribute the Deposit from time to

interest and other earnings on the Deposit shall become a part of the Deposit for all purposes, and
that all losses resulting from the investment or reinvestment thereof from time to time shall from
the time of such loss no longer constitute part of the Deposit. Title to the Deposit shall remain
in Buyer until such funds are released and consistent with the foregoing Buyer shall be deemed the
owner of the Deposit pursuant to Proposed Treas. Reg. Section&nbsp;1.468B-8(c).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;<I>Investment of the Deposit. </I>The Escrow Agent shall invest and reinvest the Deposit in the
JPMorgan Money Market Account, or in Permitted Investments (as defined below). The Escrow Agent
may use a broker-dealer of its own selection, including a broker-dealer owned by or affiliated with
the Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates. The Escrow Agent or any of its affiliates may receive
compensation with respect to any investment directed hereunder (provided that such compensation
shall be disclosed in writing to the Other Parties prior to such investment). The Escrow Agent
shall have the right to liquidate any investment held in order to release the Deposit from time to
time as provided by this Escrow Agreement. It is expressly agreed and understood by the parties
hereto that the Escrow Agent shall not in any way whatsoever be liable for losses on any
investments, including, but not limited to, losses from market risks due to premature liquidation
or resulting from other actions taken pursuant to and consistent with this Escrow Agreement. For
purposes of this Escrow Agreement, &#147;Permitted Investments&#148; shall mean direct obligations of the
U.S. government, obligations guaranteed by the U.S. government and money market funds that invest
solely in direct obligations of the U.S. government or in obligations guaranteed by the U.S.
government. Unless otherwise instructed in writing by Buyer and First Reserve, the Escrow Agent
will invest the Deposit in a JPMorgan Money Market Account.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Escrow Agent will provide to First Reserve and Buyer monthly statements setting forth the
cash balance currently held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Escrow Agreement, and detailing
all releases, payments, reimbursements or other disbursements made hereunder. Receipt, investment
and reinvestment of the Deposit shall be confirmed by the Escrow Agent as soon as practicable
following each such transaction by account statement to the Other Parties, and any discrepancies in
any such account statement shall be noted by the Other Parties to the Escrow Agent within 30
calendar days after receipt thereof. Failure to inform the Escrow Agent in writing of any
discrepancies in any such account statement within said 30-day period shall presumptively be deemed
confirmation of such account statement in its entirety. For purposes of this paragraph, (a)&nbsp;each
account statement shall be deemed to have been received by the party to whom directed on the
earlier to occur of (i)&nbsp;actual receipt thereof and (ii)&nbsp;five (5)&nbsp;Business Days (hereinafter
defined) after the deposit thereof in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, to the address for
such party set forth in this Escrow Agreement or otherwise provided by such party to Escrow Agent
in writing and (b)&nbsp;the term &#147;Business Day&#148; shall mean any day of the year, excluding Saturday,
Sunday and any other day on which national banks are required or authorized to close in Houston,
Texas.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;if there is any question as to any party&#146;s entitlement to the Deposit, the Escrow Agent

hereof, as applicable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buyer and First Reserve agree that, within fifteen days after the end of each calendar
quarter, forty percent (40%) of any income earned on the Deposit (whether interest or otherwise)
during the immediately preceding calendar quarter shall be distributed to Buyer so that Buyer may
meet the tax obligations imposed on Buyer by this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the
final distribution of the Deposit, Buyer and First Reserve agree that forty percent (40%) of any
income earned on the Deposit (whether interest or otherwise) from the end of the immediately
preceding calendar quarter through the date of the final distribution shall be distributed to Buyer
so that Buyer may meet the tax obligations imposed on Buyer by this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;<I>Amounts Distributed or Earned. </I>All amounts earned with respect to the Deposit (whether
interest or otherwise) shall become a part of the Deposit and shall be held under the same terms as
the Deposit initially delivered to the Escrow Agent hereunder. Amounts earned with respect to the
Deposit shall be paid at the time of any disbursement hereunder to the party receiving such
disbursement in accordance with the applicable provision of Section&nbsp;4.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;<I>Tax Matters. </I>Buyer shall be treated as the owner of the Deposit pursuant to Proposed
Treas. Reg. Section&nbsp;1.468B-8(c) and Buyer shall take into account all items of income, gain, loss
and deduction with respect to the Deposit for federal, state and local income tax purposes until
the Deposit is released from escrow and paid to the receiving party (the &#147;Receiving Party&#148;). Upon
release of all or a portion of the Deposit from escrow, the Receiving Party of such Deposit or
portion thereof shall be individually liable for payment (and shall indemnify the other parties for
losses incurred by the Receiving Party&#146;s nonpayment) of all taxes payable with respect to such
Deposit or portion thereof received and all related tax reporting duties. Buyer and First Reserve
shall provide the Escrow Agent with its taxpayer identification number documented by an appropriate
Form W-8 or Form W-9 and First Reserve shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
Escrow Agent with an appropriate Form W-8 or Form W-9 for each of the other Sellers, upon or as
soon as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Escrow Agreement. Failure so to provide
such forms may prevent or delay disbursements from the Deposit and may also result in the
assessment of a penalty and the Escrow

Any payments of income shall be subject to applicable withholding regulations then in force in the

until the release of the Deposit, the Escrow Agent shall report the income on the Deposit on any
required IRS information return or reporting form showing the Escrow Agent as payor and Buyer as

this Escrow Agreement shall be purely ministerial and shall be limited to those expressly set forth
in this Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Agent is not a principal, participant or beneficiary in any
transaction underlying this Escrow Agreement and shall have no duty to inquire beyond the terms and
provisions hereof. The Escrow Agent shall have no responsibility or obligation of any kind in
connection with this Escrow Agreement or the Deposit and shall not be required to deliver the
Deposit or any part thereof or take any action with respect to any matters that might arise in
connection therewith, other than to receive, hold, invest, reinvest and deliver the Deposit as
herein provided. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is hereby expressly agreed
and stipulated by the parties hereto that the Escrow Agent shall not be required to exercise any
discretion hereunder and shall have no investment or management responsibility and, accordingly,
shall have no duty to, or liability for its failure to, provide investment recommendations or
investment advice to the Other Parties or either of them. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for
any error in judgment, any act or omission, any mistake of law or fact, or for anything it may do
or refrain from doing in connection herewith, except for, subject to Section&nbsp;8 hereof, its own
fraud, willful misconduct, gross negligence or material breach of this Escrow Agreement. It is the
intention of the parties hereto that the Escrow Agent shall never be required to use, advance or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its duties
or the exercise of any of its rights and powers hereunder.

refraining from acting in accordance with, any written notice, instruction or request or other
paper furnished to it hereunder or pursuant hereto and reasonably believed by it in good faith to
have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall be
responsible for holding, investing, reinvesting and disbursing the Deposit pursuant to this Escrow
Agreement; <I>provided, however, </I>that in no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special,
indirect or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever (including but not limited to lost
profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such damage and regardless
of the form of action, and <I>provided, further, </I>that the Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any
loss arising from any cause beyond its control, including, but not limited to, the following: (a)
acts of God, force majeure, including, without limitation, war (whether or not declared or
existing), revolution, insurrection, riot, civil commotion, accident, fire, explosion, stoppage of
labor, strikes and other differences with employees; (b)&nbsp;the act, failure or neglect of any Other
Party, (c)&nbsp;the act, failure or neglect of any agent or correspondent or any other person selected

this Escrow Agreement or any part hereof or depositing the Deposit.

them or any other person, firm or entity with respect to this Escrow Agreement or the Deposit, or
should a substitute escrow agent fail to be designated as provided in Section&nbsp;16 hereof, or if the
Escrow Agent should be in doubt as to what action to take, the Escrow Agent shall have the right,
but not the obligation, either to (a)&nbsp;withhold delivery of the Deposit until the controversy is
resolved, the conflicting demands are withdrawn or its doubt is resolved or (b)&nbsp;institute a
petition for interpleader in a court of competent jurisdiction to determine the rights of the
parties hereto and pay into such court all applicable funds held by the Escrow Agent for holding
and disbursement. Should a petition for interpleader be instituted, or should the Escrow Agent be
threatened with litigation or become involved in litigation or binding arbitration in any manner
whatsoever in connection with this Escrow Agreement or the Deposit, the Other Parties hereby

Escrow Agent in connection with or resulting from such threatened or actual litigation prior to any

misconduct or fraud of the Escrow Agent).

Escrow Agent, its officers, directors, partners, employees and agents (each hereinafter referred to
as an &#147;Indemnified Party&#148;) against, and hold each Indemnified Party harmless from, any and all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys&#146; fees and court costs, losses, costs, damages and claims, including, but not limited to,
costs of investigation, litigation, tax liability suffered or incurred by any Indemnified Party in
connection with or arising from or out of this Escrow Agreement, except such acts or omissions as
may result from the fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence of, or material breach of this
Escrow Agreement by, such Indemnified Party. <B>IT IS THE EXPRESS INTENT OF EACH OF FIRST RESERVE AND
BUYER TO INDEMNIFY EACH OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES FOR, AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST,

pursuant to this section, or an Indemnified Party receives notice from any potential claimant, such
Indemnified Party shall, as promptly as practicable after receiving notice thereof, give written
notice to the Other Parties of the commencement of such action or proceeding or of the existence of
any such claim (any such action, proceeding or notice hereinafter referred to as a &#147;Claim&#148;) and

Indemnified Party and other documents and information in the possession of such Indemnified Party

Parties from any of their indemnification obligations hereunder except to the extent such
obligations could have been reduced or avoided in the absence of such failure or delay. In case
any such Claim shall be brought against any Indemnified Party, the Other Parties will be entitled
to participate in the defense of such Claim, and, after written notice from the Other Parties to
such Indemnified Party, to jointly assume the defense of such Claim with a single counsel mutually
agreed upon and appointed by the Other Parties and which counsel is reasonably acceptable to such
Indemnified Party at the Other Parties&#146; joint expense or, alternatively, if only one, but not both,
of the Other Parties elects to assume the defense of such Claim, then such party will, after
written notice to the non-electing Other Party and such Indemnified Party, be entitled to defend
such Claim separately with the cost of such defense to be shared equally by the Other Parties (in
each case the Other Parties shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and disbursements of
any separate counsel retained by such Indemnified Party in connection with such action or
proceeding, except as provided below in this paragraph). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Other
Parties shall jointly assume the defense of any Claim against any Indemnified Party, such defense
shall be jointly controlled by the Other Parties and all decisions relating thereto shall be
mutually agreed upon by the Other Parties. If only one of the Other Parties shall elect to assume
the defense of any Claim separately, such party shall obtain the prior written consent of (i)&nbsp;the
non-electing Other Party before entering into any settlement of such Claim if the settlement
imposes any cost, expense or obligation on the non-electing Other Party or does not expressly and
unconditionally release the non-electing Other Party from all liabilities and obligations with
respect to such Claim and (ii)&nbsp;the Indemnified Party if the settlement imposes any cost, expense or
obligation on the Indemnified Party or does not expressly and unconditionally release the
Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Claim. Notwithstanding
any election by the Other Parties to assume the defense of any such Claim, such Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such Claim at
the Indemnified Party&#146;s expense; <I>provided, however, </I>that such Indemnified Party shall not have the
right to settle any such Claim without the prior written consent of the Other Parties. The Other
Parties agree to pay the reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of such separate counsel
only if (i)&nbsp;the use of counsel jointly chosen by the Other Parties to represent such Indemnified
Party would present an actual conflict of interest which it would be unreasonable to waive or (ii)
the Other Parties shall authorize such Indemnified Party to employ separate counsel at the Other
Parties&#146; joint expense. If the Other Parties do not elect, jointly or separately, to assume the
defense of a Claim against any Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party shall obtain the prior
written consent of the Other Parties before entering into any settlement of such Claim.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section&nbsp;9 or in this Section&nbsp;10, the Other
Parties agree, as between themselves, to share in the aggregate amount of any reimbursable costs
pursuant to Section&nbsp;9 or indemnifiable costs pursuant to this Section&nbsp;10 for which any Indemnified
Party may be liable in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect their respective relative fault
in connection with the acts or omissions which resulted in such costs. The relative fault of First
Reserve and Buyer shall be determined by reference to
 whether the acts or omissions at issue were
those of First Reserve or Buyer respectively. If any amount paid by First Reserve or Buyer
pursuant to this Section&nbsp;10 is in excess of the amount allocable to it in accordance with the
provisions of this section, it

Buyer and First Reserve shall each pay one-half of the Escrow Agent&#146;s fee for services hereunder in
accordance with the Escrow Agent&#146;s fee schedule as attached as Schedule&nbsp;I hereto. In addition,
each of Buyer and First Reserve agree to pay one-half of all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the performance of its
duties and enforcement of its rights hereunder and otherwise in connection with the operation,
administration and enforcement of this Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, attorneys&#146;
fees, brokerage costs and related expenses incurred by the Escrow Agent, in each case to the extent
reasonably necessary in connection with such performance (collectively, &#147;Other Expenses&#148;). Buyer
and First Reserve shall be jointly and severally liable to the Escrow Agent for the payment of all
Other Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and First Reserve shall not be responsible
for any Other Expenses to the extent such expenses arise out of, relate to or result from the
Escrow Agent&#146;s material breach of this Escrow Agreement or the gross negligence, willful misconduct
or fraud of the Escrow Agent. In the even the Other Parties for any reason fail to pay any such
fees and expenses as and when the same are due, such unpaid fees and expenses shall be charged to
and set-off and paid from the Deposit by Escrow Agent without any further notice.

immediately available U.S. Federal Funds to an account or accounts designated by the payee
therefor. In the event funds transfer instructions are given (other than in writing at the time of
execution of this Escrow Agreement), whether in writing, by telefax, or otherwise, the Escrow Agent
is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to the person or
persons designated on Schedule&nbsp;II hereto, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of
anyone purporting to be the person or persons so designated. If the Escrow Agent is unable to
contact any of the authorized representatives identified in Schedule&nbsp;II, the Escrow Agent is hereby
authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by telephone call-back to any one or more of
your executive officers, (&#147;Executive Officers&#148;), which shall include (a)&nbsp;in the case of Buyer, the
titles of Chief Executive Officer and Senior Vice President Corporate Development and (b)&nbsp;in the
case of First Reserve, the titles of Vice President, Manager or Director, as the Escrow Agent may
select. Such &#147;Executive Officer&#148; shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a fully executed Incumbency
Certificate, and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmation of anyone purporting to be any
such officer. The persons and telephone numbers for call-backs may be changed only in writing
