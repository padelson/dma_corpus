AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 



 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of July 6, 2016 (the " _Agreement Date_ "), by and among BIO-TECHNE
CORPORATION, a Minnesota corporation (" _Parent_ "), AERO MERGER SUB, INC., a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "),
ADVANCED CELL DIAGNOSTICS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "),
and FORTIS ADVISORS LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, solely in its
capacity as the Securityholders' Representative. Certain other capitalized
terms used in this Agreement are defined in _Exhibit A_. Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, and the Securityholders' Representative are occasionally referred
to herein as the "parties."

 



 

RECITALS

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend to effect a merger (as that
term is defined in the DGCL) whereby Merger Sub will merge with and into the
Company in accordance with this Agreement and the DGCL (the " _Merger_ ").
Upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the
Company will become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent;

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
shareholders that the parties consummate the transactions contemplated hereby,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided for herein; and

 



 

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe
various conditions to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, conditions and
agreements set forth herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereby
agree as follows:

 



 

1. DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION. 

 



 

1.1 The Merger; Effective Time; Closing; Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(a) Merger of Merger Sub into the Company. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined
below), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
existence of Merger Sub will cease. The Company will continue as the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). The Merger will
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions
of the DGCL.

 



 

(b) Effective Time. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, Parent will cause to be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the Certificate of
Merger in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ in such form
as required by, and executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of,
the DGCL (collectively, the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger will
become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with
and accepted by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such
other time as Parent and the Company agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Closing. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all of the
conditions to the Closing contained in _Section_ _6_ , the closing of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take
place as soon as practicable (but not later than three Business Days) after
the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Closing contained in
_Section_ _6_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), unless another date is agreed to in writing by all of the parties
hereto. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred
to as the " _Closing Date_." All proceedings to be taken, all documents to be
executed and delivered by the parties, and all payments to be made and
consideration to be delivered at the Closing will be deemed to have been taken
and executed simultaneously, and, except as permitted hereunder, no
proceedings will be deemed taken nor any documents executed or delivered until
all have been taken, executed and delivered.

 



 

(d) Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(i) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
(the " _Company Charter_ ") will be amended and restated so as to read in its
entirety as the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub, except that the
name of the Surviving Corporation will not be amended, and, as so amended and
restated, such Company Charter will be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein
and by applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(ii) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of
the Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company will be amended and
restated so as to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Merger Sub, and, as
so amended and restated, will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Legal
Requirements.

 



 

(iii) Effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time, the
board of directors of the Surviving Corporation will consist solely of the
members of the board of directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office until the earlier of his or her
resignation, removal or death or until his or her successor is duly elected
and qualified, as the case may be, in accordance with the Company Charter and
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Legal Requirements.

 



 

(iv) Effective as of, and immediately following, the Effective Time, the
only officers of the Surviving Corporation will be the officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

Surviving Corporation will possess all properties, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, and all of the claims,
obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will
become subject to the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.

lender, amount of Company Debt and the wire transfer information of each
lender; (h) the aggregate amount of Company Change in Control Payments, along
with a breakdown by Person entitled to receive such payment; (i) the Aggregate
Company Option Exercise Price Amount and the Aggregate Company Option Payment
Amount as of the Closing; (j) the Aggregate Company Warrant Exercise Price
Amount as of the Closing and the Aggregate Company Warrant Payment Amount; (k)
the Escrow Amount; and (l) the Securityholders' Representative Amount. In no
event will the aggregate amount payable by Parent set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet, or any update thereto, exceed the Aggregate Closing
Merger Consideration, as adjusted by the Final Adjustment Amount.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) Closing Consideration Spreadsheet. The Company, on behalf of the
Company Securityholders, will prepare and deliver to Parent, no less than two
Business Days prior to the Closing, an update to the Consideration Spreadsheet
setting forth any changes in amounts due to the estimated time of the Closing
or changes in the other inputs to the calculations contemplated thereby (the "
_Closing Consideration Spreadsheet_ ").

 



 

(d) Updates to Closing Consideration Spreadsheet. Upon prior reasonable
notice from Parent in connection with any scheduled distribution of the Escrow
Amount or payment of any Earn-out Payments to the Company Securityholders, the
Securityholders' Representative will deliver to Parent (and to the Paying
Agent and Escrow Agent, as appropriate) an updated Consideration Spreadsheet
that reflects such contemplated distributions of the Escrow Amount or payment
of any Earn-out Payments to Company Securityholders.

 



 

(e) Accuracy of Consideration Spreadsheets. The Consideration Spreadsheet,
the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, and any other updates to the
Consideration Spreadsheet are the sole responsibility of the Company
Securityholders, and the Company Securityholders hereby agree that neither the
Company nor Parent, nor any of Parent's Affiliates, will have any
responsibility or liability for any errors, omissions or inaccuracies therein.
Parent, its Affiliates and Paying Agent will be entitled to rely on the
accuracy of the Consideration Spreadsheet, the Closing Consideration
Spreadsheet, and any other updates to the Consideration Spreadsheet in all
respects, and Parent's obligation to make any payments pursuant to this
_Section_ _1_ will be deemed fulfilled to the extent that Parent makes such
payments in accordance with the foregoing. For clarity, the Company
Securityholders will not be liable to Parent, any of Parent's Affiliates or
Paying Agent for any errors, omissions or inaccuracies in the Consideration
Spreadsheet that are corrected in the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet or any
update thereto that are corrected on a timely basis in a subsequent update
thereto. A correction shall only be timely if such correction is made prior to
such time as Parent makes a payment, deposit, or disbursement in accordance
with any inaccurate statement.

 



 

 



   



 

(f) Escrow Amount. At the Closing, an amount in cash equal to $25,000,000
of the Closing Merger Consideration (the " _Escrow Amount_ ") will be withheld
and deposited by Parent in a separate account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") with
JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). The Escrow Amount will be
held and distributed as provided in the Escrow Agreement and as described
herein. The Escrow Amount will be held solely for the purpose of securing the
post-Closing obligations of the Company Securityholders set forth in this
Agreement (including the indemnification obligations of the Company
Securityholders) and making any payments owed to Parent or the other
Indemnified Persons pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to a reserve to the
extent of any pending claims, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agreement will provide for the release of
amounts remaining in the Escrow Account on the 18-month anniversary of the
Closing; _provided_ , _however_ , that no amounts subject to unresolved claims
will be released until such claims are resolved. Any release and payment of
amounts remaining in the Escrow Account to Company Securityholders will be
made in accordance with the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet, as updated in
accordance with this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company will pay 50% of
all fees, costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent with respect to the Escrow
Account. All fees, costs and expenses of the Paying Agent with respect to the
Exchange Fund, will be paid by Parent. The Escrow Amount will be held by the
Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. The
Escrow Amount will be held as a trust fund and will not be subject to any
lien, attachment, trustee process or any other judicial process of any
creditor of any party, and will be held and disbursed solely for the purposes
and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.
The approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the Company Securityholders
will constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement and of all of the
arrangements relating thereto, including the placement of the Escrow Amount in
escrow.

 



 

(g) Securityholders' Representative Amount. At the Closing, an amount in
cash equal to $1,250,000 of the Closing Merger Consideration (the "
_Securityholders ' Representative Amount_") will be deposited by Parent with
the Escrow Agent. The Securityholders' Representative Amount will be used, in
the sole and absolute discretion of the Securityholders' Representative, (i)
to pay or reimburse the Securityholders' Representative Expenses, if any,
incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in accordance with or
otherwise related to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Securityholders' Representative engagement agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby; (ii) to pay or reimburse any other fees,
costs or expenses incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in the
performance of its obligations as the Securityholders' Representative; and
(iii) as otherwise determined by the Advisory Group. The Escrow Agreement will
provide that, upon the request of the Securityholders' Representative, any or
all of remaining Securityholders' Representative Amount will be released and
paid to the Company Securityholders (in accordance with each Company
Securityholder's Pro Rata Portion). All fees, costs and expenses of the Escrow
Agent with respect to the Securityholders' Representative Amount will be paid
by the Securityholders' Representative for and on behalf of the Company
Securityholders (in accordance with each Company Securityholder's Pro Rata
Portion). The retention by the Securityholders' Representative of any amounts
in the Securityholders' Representative Amount from time to time shall not be
used as evidence that the Securityholders have any liability hereunder.

 



 

 



   



 

1.5 Closing Date Adjustment.

 



 

(a) The Company will deliver to Parent the Company's good-faith estimate
of the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the " _Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital_ ") and a good-faith estimate of the corresponding Adjustment
Amount no later than two Business Days prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement_ "). Such estimates will
be based on the Company's books and records, the good faith estimate of the
management of the Company and other information then available. Parent will
have the right to review the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement and such supporting documentation or data of the Company as Parent
may reasonably request. If Parent does not agree with the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital Statement, the Securityholders' Representative and
Parent will negotiate in good faith to mutually agree on an acceptable
Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital, and the Securityholders'
Representative will consider in good faith any proposed comments or changes
that Parent may reasonably suggest; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure
to include in the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital any changes
proposed by Parent, or the acceptance by Parent of the Estimated Closing Date
Net Working Capital Statement, or the consummation of the Closing, will not
limit or otherwise affect Parent's remedies under this Agreement, including
Parent's right to include such changes or other changes in the Closing Date
Net Working Capital Statement, or constitute an acknowledgment by Parent of
the accuracy of the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the failure of Parent and the Securityholders' Representative
to reach such mutual agreement will not give any party the right to terminate
this Agreement or otherwise fail to close the transactions contemplated
hereunder, or otherwise delay the Closing; and the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital (i) delivered by the Company or (ii) as agreed to by the
Securityholders' Representative and Parent will be the figure used for
purposes of determining the Estimated Adjustment Amount.

 



 

(b) The Adjustment Amount used for the calculation of the Closing Merger
Consideration on the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Adjustment Amount_ ") will
be based on the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital. Parent and the
Company acknowledge and agree that the exact Adjustment Amount will not be
known as of the Closing Date and that the Adjustment Amount determined on the
Closing Date may need to be adjusted subsequent to the Closing Date on the
basis set forth herein. Accordingly, no later than 90 days after the Closing
Date, Parent will prepare and deliver to the Securityholders' Representative
(i) an unaudited balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Date (the "
_Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ") prepared in accordance with GAAP and the
Company's past accounting methods, practices, policies and principles
(including classification and estimation methodologies) (as adjusted by the
terms of this Agreement), (ii) a determination of the Closing Date Net Working
Capital, and (iii) a statement setting forth the determination of the
resulting Adjustment Amount (the " _Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement_ "), which will be accompanied by a description in reasonable detail
of Parent's differences with the Company's determination of the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital. To the extent not set forth in the Closing
Date Net Working Capital Statement, Parent shall be deemed to have accepted
and agreed with the Company's calculations of all other items and amounts
contained in the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement. If, for
any reason, unless Parent has delivered written notice to the Securityholders'
Representative at least five days prior to the expiration of the 90-day time
period required by this _Section_ _1.5(b)_ that the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement will be delayed no more than 30 calendar days following
expiration of such 90-day period and the Company Securityholders are not
materially prejudiced by such delay, the Parent fails to deliver the Closing
Date Net Working Capital Statement within the time period required by this
_Section 1.5(b)_, the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement
delivered by the Company to the Parent prior to the Closing shall be
considered for all purposes of this Agreement as being the "Closing Date Net
Working Capital Statement" delivered by the Parent pursuant to this Section
and the Securityholders' Representative shall have all of its rights under
this _Section_ _1.5_ with respect to such certificate.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) The Securityholders' Representative and Parent will have the right to
review all records, work papers and calculations that are reasonably necessary
for the purpose of reviewing the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement, the Closing Date Balance Sheet and the Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement. The Securityholders' Representative will have 30 days after
Parent delivers the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement and all of the
aforementioned requested records, work papers and calculations in which to
notify Parent in writing (such notice, a " _Closing Date Net Working Capital
Dispute Notice_ ") of any discrepancy in, or disagreement with, the items
reflected on the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement (and specifying
the amount in dispute and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for
such discrepancy or disagreement), and upon agreement by Parent regarding the
adjustment requested by the Securityholders' Representative, an appropriate
adjustment will be made thereto. If the Securityholders' Representative does
not deliver a Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute Notice to Parent during
such 30 day period, the Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement will be
deemed to be accepted in the form presented to the Securityholders'
Representative. If the Securityholders' Representative timely delivers a
Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute Notice and Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative do not agree, within 15 days after timely
delivery of the Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute Notice, to resolve
any discrepancy or disagreement therein, the discrepancy or disagreement will
be submitted for review and final determination by the Independent Accounting
Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm will, to the extent reasonably
practicable, be independent with respect to Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative. The review by the Independent Accounting Firm will be limited
to the discrepancies and disagreements set forth in the Closing Date Net
Working Capital Dispute Notice, and the resolution of such discrepancies and
disagreements and the determination of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
and the resulting Adjustment Amount by the Independent Accounting Firm must be
(i) in writing, (ii) made in accordance with GAAP (as adjusted by the terms of
this Agreement) in accordance with the Company's past accounting methods,
practices, policies and principles (including classification and estimation
methodologies), (iii) with respect to any specific discrepancy or
disagreement, no greater than the higher amount calculated by Parent or the
Securityholders' Representative, as the case may be, and no lower than the
lower amount calculated by Parent or the Securityholders' Representative as
the case may be, (iv) made as promptly as practical after the submission of
such discrepancies and disagreements to the Independent Accounting Firm (but
in no event later than 30 days after the date of submission), and (v) final
and binding upon, and non-appealable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns for all purposes hereof, and not subject to
collateral attack for any reason absent manifest error or fraud. The fees,
costs and expenses of retaining the Independent Accounting Firm will be
allocated between the Company Securityholders and Parent in inverse proportion
as they may prevail on matters resolved by the Independent Accounting Firm,
which proportion will be based on the amounts proposed by the Company
Securityholders' Representative and Parent. Following the resolution of all
objections of the Securityholders' Representative regarding the manner in
which any item or items are treated on the Closing Date Net Working Capital
Statement, by mutual agreement or Independent Accounting Firm, Parent will
prepare the final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement reflecting such
resolution and will deliver copies thereof to the Securityholders'
Representative and such final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement will
be the " _Final Closing Date Net Working Capital Statement_ ," and, for the
avoidance of doubt, the final Adjustment Amount set forth in the Final Closing
Date Net Working Capital Statement will be the " _Final Adjustment Amount_."

 



 

 



   



 

(d) If the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount
used for the calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration on the Closing
Date (the " _Positive Adjustment Amount_ "), then, within five Business Days
of the final determination of the Final Adjustment Amount, Parent will deposit
(i) with the Paying Agent for further distribution to the Company Stockholders
and Company Warrantholders and (ii) with the Surviving Corporation for further
distribution to the Company Optionholders through the Surviving Corporation's
payroll system, _less_ any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes,
the entire amount of such difference by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in accordance with the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet. If the
Estimated Adjustment Amount used for the calculation of the Closing Merger
Consideration on the Closing Date exceeds the Final Adjustment Amount (the "
_Negative Adjustment Amount_ "), then, within five Business Days of the final
determination of the Final Adjustment Amount, Parent will receive the amount
of such excess by wire transfer of immediately available funds out of the
Escrow Account, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement. If the Negative Adjustment Amount is equal to or greater than
$1,000,000, the Company Securityholders will promptly, but in no event more
than 30 calendar days after receipt of notice from the Parent of such
depletion, which notice shall specify the amount that is required to be
deposited by each Company Securityholder, deposit their Pro Rata Portions of
the amount by which the Negative Adjustment Amount exceeds $1,000,000 into the
Escrow Account with the Escrow Agent. For clarity, except for intentional
fraud committed by one of the parties hereto, the process set forth in this
_Section 1.5_ shall be the exclusive remedy of Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative for disputes related to the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital Statement, Closing Date Balance Sheet, Closing Date Working Capital
Statement, Closing Date Net Working Capital Dispute Notice and any amounts set
forth therein.

 



 

1.6 Earn-out Payments.

 



 

(a) In addition to the Closing Merger Consideration, _Parent will pay an
additional aggregate amount up to $75,000,000.00 (the "_ _Earn-out Amount_ _"
) as determined under __Section_ _1.6(d)_. _The Earn-out Amount_ shall be
payable with respect to each Company Share (other than any Company Shares to
be canceled pursuant to _Section_ _1.8(a)_ and the Dissenting Shares), Company
Options, and Company Warrants that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time in an amount equal to a fraction, the _numerator_ of which
equals the applicable Earn-out Payment and the _denominator_ of which equals
the sum of the number of Company Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _plus_ the number of Company Shares purchasable
upon exercise of Company Options that were outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, _plus_ the number of Company Shares purchasable upon
exercise of Company Warrants that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) With respect to that portion of each Earn-out Payment payable to
the Company Stockholders and the Company Warrantholders, no more than 30 days
after the applicable Earn-out Payment Date, Parent will deposit, or cause to
be deposited with the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds for the benefit of and distribution to the Company Stockholders and
Company Warrantholders, that portion of such Earn-out Payment payable to the
Company Stockholders and Company Warrantholders.

 



 

(c) With respect to that portion of each Earn-Out Amount payable to
the Company Optionholders, no more than 30 days after the applicable Earn-out
Payment Date, Parent will deliver cash in an amount equal to the portion of
such Earn-Out Payment payable to Company Optionholders to the Surviving
Corporation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for further
distribution through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system, _less_ any
applicable income and employment withholding Taxes.

 



 

(d) _The Earn-out Payments will be determined as follows:_

 



 

(i) If Revenues for the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 2016
and ending on December 31, 2016 (the " _First Measurement Period_ ") equal or
exceed $30,000,000.00 (the " _2016 Revenue Milestone_ "), Parent will pay
$25,000,000.00 of the Earn-out Amount (the " _First Earn-out Payment_ "). If
the 2016 Revenue Milestone is not met, then the First Earn-out Payment will
roll over into calendar year 2017 and potentially qualify for payment if the
2017 Revenue Milestone is achieved, as set forth in subsection (iii) below.

 



 

(ii) If the 2016 Revenue Milestone is met, Parent will pay an additional
$50,000,000.00 if Revenues for the twelve-month period beginning on January 1,
2017 and ending on December 31, 2017 (the " _Second Measurement Period_ ")
equal or exceed $45,000,000.00 (the " _2017 Revenue Milestone_ ").

 



 

(iii) If the 2016 Revenue Milestone is not met during the First
Measurement Period, but the 2017 Revenue Milestone is met during the Second
Measurement Period, then the payment made upon achievement of the 2017 Revenue
Milestone will be $75,000,000.00 (the payment made pursuant to clause (ii) or
(iii), as applicable, the " _Second Earn-Out Payment_ ").

 



 

(iv) If the 2016 Revenue Milestone is met during the First Measurement
Period, but the Revenues during the Second Measurement Period are at or below
$40,000,000.00, no additional payments will be made. If the 2016 Revenue
Milestone is met during the First Measurement Period and the Revenues for
calendar year 2017 exceed $40,000,000.00, but are less than $45,000,000.00,
then the additional payment (the " _Reduced Second Earn-Out Payment_ ") will
be at least $20,000,000.00 and up to a maximum of $40,000,000.00. Such
additional payment will be calculated on a sliding scale using the following
formula:

 



 

E = 4R - 140,000,000

 



 

 _where_

 



 

E = the Reduced Second Earn-Out Payment to be paid; and

 



 

R = Revenues achieved in calendar year 2017.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) Parent will have the right to offset any Damages finally
determined pursuant to the procedures and subject to the limitations set forth
in _Section_ ___8_ to be owed to Parent Indemnified Persons, subject to the
limitations contained in _Section_ ___8_ , against any of the First, Second or
Reduced Second Earn-out Payment owed under this _Section 1.6_.

 



 

(f) No later than 60 days after the end of each Earn-out Measurement
Period, Parent will prepare and deliver to the Securityholders' Representative
(i) an unaudited statement of income of the Surviving Corporation for such
Earn-out Measurement Period, (ii) a statement of the Revenues for such Earn-
out Measurement Period, and (iii) a statement setting forth Parent's
determination of the resulting Earn-out Payment in respect of such Earn-out
Measurement Period (collectively, the " _Earn-out Statements_ "). Parent shall
provide the Securityholders' Representative with all information directly
relating to the Earn-out Statements (in electronic format, if available) that
the Securityholders' Representative may reasonably request in order to review
each Earn-out Statement, including the relevant books, records and documents
Parent prepared or reviewed in preparing such Earn-out Statement. In addition,
Parent shall provide the Securityholders' Representative and its advisors with
reasonable access during regular business hours to employees of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation reasonably necessary to complete its review of such
Earn-out Statement. The provisions of _Section_ _1.5(c)_ shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_ to any dispute regarding any Earn-out Payment or the information set
forth in an Earn-out Statement.

 



 

(g) From the Closing Date through the end of the Second Measurement
Period, Parent covenants and agrees that (i) it will not take any action, the
primary intent of which is to reduce the amount of the Earn-out Payments, and
(ii) it will use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve the Revenue
Milestones set forth in _Section 1.6(d)_ hereof. In addition, from the Closing
Date through the end of the Second Measurement Period, Parent covenants and
agrees as follows:

 



 

(i) Throughout the First Measurement Period (during the time Parent
controls the Company) and the Second Measurement Period, Parent shall (v)
allow the senior management members of the Company who become continuing
employees to make operational decisions for the Surviving Corporation during
such times as they remain continuing employees provided such decisions do not
contradict or violate Parent's policies or requirements that are generally
applicable to Parent's other lines of business and further provided that all
operational decisions are consistent in all material respects with the
operating plan included as _Section 1.6(g)(i)(w)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and such employees remain employed with the Surviving Corporation and
are not in material breach or violation of any of Parent's policies or codes
of conduct or any agreement relating to such employee's employment with the
Surviving Corporation, (w) support the conduct of the business of the Company
consistent in all material respects with the operating plan included as
_Section_ _ _ _1.6(g)(i)(_ _w_ _)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (x)
continue to make each of the products of the Company available for sale; (y)
not require any continuing employee of the Company to spend more than a de
minimis amount of time on responsibilities unrelated to the business of the
Company; and (z) continue to operate the Surviving Corporation as a going
concern and shall not (1) engage in discounting, promotional and refund
practices that are materially inconsistent with those of the Company pre-
Closing, (2) materially and adversely change the compensation structure or
levels for sales personnel of the Surviving Corporation from those of the
Company pre-Closing, or (3) permit the sale of equipment or other material
assets of the Surviving Corporation outside the ordinary course of business.
Subject to the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Parent
may make, from time to time, such business decisions as it deems appropriate
in Parent's reasonable and good faith discretion in the conduct of the
business of the Company, including actions with respect to the ownership and
operation of the assets used in connection with such business. Upon the
written request of the Securityholders' Representative no more than once a
fiscal quarter, Parent shall furnish a report in reasonable detail regarding
the Revenues achieved for the most recently completed fiscal quarter of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) In the event of any divesting sale, exclusive license or other
disposition of a product line of the Company during such period by Parent, any
of its Affiliates or the Surviving Corporation to a third party (a " _Product
Sale_ ") or any acquisition of the business of the Company during such period
by a third party, whether by an acquisition of all or substantially all of the
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation (by merger, consolidation, stock
sale or otherwise) or all or substantially all of the assets used in such
business (a " _Business Sale_ "), after such Product Sale or Business Sale,
revenues attributable to products of the Company sold, licensed or otherwise
transferred to a third party in a Product Sale or Business Sale will continue
to be deemed Revenues under this Agreement. In addition, upon the occurrence
of any Product Sale or Business Sale during such period, Parent shall cause
the third party acquiring a Company product and/or the business of the
Company, as applicable, to assume the obligations of Parent (and Parent shall
remain responsible for such third party's performance) under this _Section
1.6_ with respect to any Company products acquired by such third party. In the
event of any assumption of any obligations of Parent under the preceding
sentence, the third party assuming such obligations shall enter into an
agreement with the Securityholders' Representative, on behalf of the Company
Securityholders, in a form reasonably acceptable to the Securityholders'
Representative, agreeing to be bound by the applicable provisions of this
Agreement, to ensure that the Company Securityholders' rights to receive the
Earn-out Amount are not adversely affected by such Product Sale or Business
Sale.

 



 

(iii) In the event that any Acquisition Proposal involving Parent
(substituting references to "Parent" for references to "the Company" and
references to "50.1%" for references to "15%" in the definition thereof)
occurs during such period, Parent shall cause Parent's successor entity or
surviving entity to assume the obligations of Parent (and, if Parent survives
such transaction, Parent shall remain responsible for such entity's
performance) under this _Section 1.6_. In the event of any assumption of any
obligations of Parent under the preceding sentence, Parent's successor entity
or surviving entity shall enter into an agreement with the Securityholders'
Representative, on behalf of the Company Securityholders, in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Securityholders' Representative, agreeing to be bound by the
applicable provisions of this Agreement, to ensure that the Company
Securityholders' rights to receive the Earn-out Amount are not adversely
affected by such Acquisition Proposal involving Parent.

 



 

 



   



 

(iv) If there is an Earn-out Event of Default, then the maximum Earn-out
Amount that may otherwise be earned pursuant to this _Section 1.6_ after the
occurrence of an Earn-out Event of Default shall be accelerated and become
immediately due and payable. For purposes of this _Section_ _1.6(g)(iv)_ , the
term " _Earn-out Event of Default_ " shall mean the occurrence of any material
breach or material default of or material violation in the performance of any
of the covenants or agreements contained in this _Section_ _1.6_ by Parent
that is not cured within 20 Business Days following Parent's receipt of
written notice from the Securityholders' Representative of the occurrence of
such breach, default or violation.

 



 

1.7 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, recording and other
similar fees payable in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will be the responsibility of, and will be paid 50% by the
Company Securityholders and 50% by the Parent.

 



 

1.8 Treatment of Company Securities.

 



 

(a) Conversion. At and as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or any Company Securityholder, each Company Share outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive from Parent, promptly following the surrender of the certificate
representing such Company Share (each, a " _Company Stock Certificate_ ") and
a properly completed Letter of Transmittal, the consideration set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet, as updated in accordance with this _Section_ _1_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) no consideration will be paid with respect
to any Company Share held in treasury of the Company and each Company Share
owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any direct or indirect wholly-
owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (ii) each Dissenting Share will be converted into the
right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto
in accordance with the DGCL. For purposes of calculating the amount of the
Closing Merger Consideration payable to each Company Securityholder pursuant
to this _Section 1_ , all amounts payable in cash to such Company
Securityholder will be aggregated and rounded up to the nearest whole cent
(with $0.005 being rounded upward) and computed after aggregating the amounts
payable for all shares of each class of Company Shares held by such Company
Securityholder represented by a particular stock certificate, option grant, or
warrant. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Company Shares,
Company Options, and Company Warrants will cease to have any rights with
respect to the Company Shares, Company Options, and Company Warrants
represented thereby, other than the right to receive the amounts provided in
this _Section_ _1_ or, with respect to the holders of Company Shares who
properly perfect such Company Securityholders' appraisal rights in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL, the right to exercise their appraisal rights in
accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



 

(b) Each share of the common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into
one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and, as of the
Effective Time, all such shares will constitute all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. Each stock
certificate of Merger Sub evidencing ownership of any such shares will remain
outstanding and evidence ownership of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

 



   



 

1.9 Surrender of Company Stock Certificates.

 



 

(a) At the Effective Time, holders of Company Stock Certificates
representing the Company Shares will cease to have any rights as shareholders
of the Company, and the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed
with respect to all shares of such capital stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. No further transfer of any such Company Shares will be
made on such stock transfer books after the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, a valid Company Stock Certificate is presented to the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, such Company Stock Certificate will be
canceled and will be exchanged as provided in this _Section_ _1.9_.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver to each Company
Stockholder a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit G_
(each, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ "). At least two Business Days, but not
more than five Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company will deliver to
Parent properly completed and duly executed Letters of Transmittal, effective
as of the Effective Time and executed by Company Stockholders holding no less
than 95% of the voting power of the Company Shares as of the Closing, together
with the appropriate Company Stock Certificate (or an affidavit of loss and a
bond in lieu thereof). Following the Effective Time, the holder of a Company
Stock Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor payment of
an amount equal to the applicable amount set forth on the Closing
Consideration Spreadsheet, and the Company Stock Certificate so surrendered
will be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section_ _ 1.9_,
each Company Stock Certificate will be deemed, from and after the Effective
Time, to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender an amount
equal to the applicable amount set forth on the Closing Consideration
Spreadsheet. If any Company Stock Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed,
the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock Certificate may
provide (in lieu of such Company Stock Certificate) an appropriate affidavit
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent or the
Surviving Corporation with respect to such Company Stock Certificate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the owner of any such Company Stock Certificate
will also be required to deliver a bond in such sum as the Paying Agent in its
reasonable discretion may require.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Securityholders' Representative, the Paying Agent, or the Escrow Agent will be
liable to any Company Securityholder for any portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Legal Requirement. Any Aggregate Merger
Consideration remaining undistributed to Company Securityholders immediately
prior to such time as such Aggregate Merger Consideration payable to the
Company Securityholders pursuant to this _Section_ _1_ would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any Governmental Authority will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, but thereafter remaining subject to any and all claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

 



   



 

1.10 Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
any shares of capital stock of the Company that, as of the Effective Time, are
held by a Company Stockholder exercising such Company Stockholder's right to
demand appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ") will not be converted into or represent the right to receive
payment in accordance with _Sections_ _1.8_ and _1.9_ , and such Company
Stockholders will be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such
Company Stockholders in Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if such Company Stockholder's right of appraisal is not perfected, or if such
Company Stockholder's demand for payment is withdrawn pursuant to Section
262(k) of the DGCL, as of the later of the Effective Time or the time of the
failure to perfect such status or the withdrawal of such demand, such shares
will automatically be converted into and will represent only the right to
receive (upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates representing
such shares) payment in accordance with _Sections_ _1.8_ and _1.9_.

 



 

(b) The Company will (i) give Parent prompt written notice of any written
demand for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and of any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, and (ii) give Parent the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand. The Company will
not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with
respect to any such demand unless Parent has consented in writing to such
payment or settlement offer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

 



 

1.11 Withholding Rights. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent, as applicable, will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Company Securityholder such amounts as Parent, the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, as the case
may be, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority by Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or the Escrow Agent, such withheld amounts will
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Company Securityholder in respect of which such withholding and payment was
made.

 



 

1.12 Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Securities six months
following the final Earn-Out Payment Date will, upon demand by Parent, be
delivered to Parent, and any holder of Company Securities who has not
previously complied with the provisions of this _Section_ _1_ will be
entitled, after complying with the provisions of this _Section_ _1_ , and
subject to any escheat or similar laws, to receive from Parent payment of the
applicable portion of such undistributed amount with respect to such Company
Securities.

 



 

 



   



 

1.13 Treatment of Company Options.

 



 

(a) Company Options will not be continued, assumed or substituted by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent as part of the Merger. Prior to the Closing,
the Company's board of directors will adopt appropriate resolutions and will
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to cause each Company Option
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, to be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Option Termination
Agreements) cash payments with respect thereto equal to the amounts set forth
on the Consideration Spreadsheet, as updated in accordance with this Section
1, less any applicable withholding Taxes , at the time(s) described herein.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, all Company Options that are vested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Vested Company Options_ ") will be
cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) promptly after the
Effective Time, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(A) the aggregate number of Company Shares for which such Vested Company
Option was vested immediately prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B)
the difference between the per Company Share amount of the Closing Cash
Consideration _minus_ the per share exercise price of such Company Option,
(ii) a Pro Rata Portion of the release of any Escrow Amount or Final
Adjustment Amount payable to Company Securityholders, (iii) the portion of
each Earn-out Payment, if any, payable with respect to such Company Option in
the manner provided in _Section_ 1.6 and (iv) a Reallocation Pro Rata Portion
of the release of any Total Reallocated Merger Consideration payable to the
Company Securityholders as provided in _Section 1.17_.

 



 

(c) As of the Effective Time, all Company Options that are unvested as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Unvested Company Options_ ") will
be cancelled and converted into the right to receive, within 15 days after the
applicable date or dates on which such Unvested Company Option would have
become vested pursuant to its original terms (including without limitation as
a result of any accelerated vesting resulting from a termination of
employment), but provided that such Company Optionholder remains in continuous
service with the Company, the Parent or an affiliate thereof on each such
date, (1) the amount described in Section 1.13(b)(i) above and (2) at such
time following the Effective Time as payments are made to Company
Stockholders, the amounts described in Sections 1.13(b)(ii), (iii) and (iv)
above (or, if such payments have already been made to Company Stockholders, at
the same time as the payment is made to such former Company Optionholder
pursuant to Clause (1) above). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the
payment amounts pursuant to this Subsection (c) may be accrued, aggregated and
paid on a quarterly basis but no later than 30 days after the end of an
applicable quarter, provided that the Company Optionholder need not remain
employed on the payment date to receive such accrued payments. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this subsection (c), any then-unvested Company
Options as of the last day of the Second Measurement Period shall be
accelerated in full with respect to any Company Optionholder who remains in
continuous service to the Company, the Parent or an affiliate thereof on such
date. Any amounts that do not become payable in respect of such Unvested
Company Options pursuant to this subsection (c) shall become payable to the
Company Securityholders pursuant to _Section 1.17_ below.

 



 

(d) In accordance with this Agreement and the Option Termination
Agreements, as promptly as reasonably practicable in the ordinary course of
business following the date that any portion of the amount set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet is due (and, with respect to payments made as of the
Closing, if any, no later than the first regular payroll date occurring at
least three Business Days after the Effective Time), the Surviving
Corporation, through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system, will pay to
the former holders of Company Options such amounts as such holders will be
entitled to receive pursuant to this _Section_ _1.13_ and the Option
Termination Agreements, reduced by applicable withholding Taxes.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) In accordance with _Section 1.15_ below, any portion of the proceeds
payable with respect to any Company Option that is held in the Escrow Account
will be subject to withholding for income and employment Taxes at such time as
the amounts are payable to the holders of such Company Options. Any portion of
any Earn-out Payment that becomes payable with respect to any Company Option
will be subject to withholding for income and employment Taxes as of the
applicable Earn-out Payment Date.

 



 

1.14 Treatment of Company Warrants.

 



 

(a) Company Warrants will not be continued, assumed or substituted by the
Surviving Corporation or Parent as part of the Merger. Prior to the Closing,
the Company's board of directors will adopt appropriate resolutions and will
take all other actions necessary and appropriate to cause each Company Warrant
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or
unvested, to and be cancelled and converted into the right to receive (subject
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement) a cash payment with respect
thereto equal to the amount set forth below, less any applicable withholding
Taxes , at the time(s) described herein.

 



 

(b) As of the Effective Time, all Company Warrants will be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive (i) promptly after the Effective Time, an
amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the aggregate
number of Company Shares for which such Company Warrant was vested immediately
prior to the Effective Time, _multiplied by_ (B) the difference between the
per Company Share amount of the Closing Cash Consideration _minus_ the per
share exercise price of such Company Warrant, (ii) a Pro Rata Portion of the
release of any Escrow Amount or Final Adjustment Amount payable to Company
Securityholders, (iii) the portion of each Earn-out Payment, if any, payable
with respect to such Company Warrant in the manner provided in _Section_ _1.6_
, and (iv) a Reallocation Pro Rata Portion of the release of any Total
Reallocated Merger Consideration payable to the Company Securityholders as
provided in Section 1.17.

 



 

(c) In accordance with this Agreement and the Warrant Termination
Agreements, as promptly as reasonably practicable in the ordinary course of
business following the date that any portion of the amount set forth on the
Consideration Spreadsheet is due to Company Warrantholders, Parent will
deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Payment Agent, cash in an amount
equal to such amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds, for
further distribution by the Paying Agent to the Company Warrantholders in
accordance with the updated Consideration Spreadsheet.

 



 

 



   



 

1.15 Securityholders' Representative.

 



 

(a) Each Company Securityholder, by virtue of the approval of the Merger
and this Agreement and without any further action of any of the Company
Securityholders or the Company, hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints
Fortis Advisors LLC as his, her or its sole, exclusive, true and lawful agent
and attorney-in-fact (the " _Securityholders ' Representative_"), with full
power of substitution to act in such Company Securityholder's name, place and
stead with respect to all transactions contemplated by and all terms and
provisions of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and to act on such
Company Securityholder's behalf in any dispute, litigation or arbitration
involving this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, and to do or refrain from
doing all such further acts and things, and execute all such documents, on
such Company Securityholder's behalf, as the Securityholders' Representative
deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including the power:
(i) to execute and deliver this Agreement and any and all amendments, waivers
or modifications hereof; (ii) to waive any condition to the obligations of
such Company Securityholder to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (iii) to execute and deliver all ancillary agreements,
certificates and documents, and to make representations and warranties
therein, on behalf of such Company Securityholder that the Securityholders'
Representative deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement; (iv) to receive on behalf of, and to distribute (after payment of
(A) any unpaid expenses chargeable to the Company Securityholders or the
Company prior to the Closing in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (B) amounts payable by the Company Securityholders
pursuant to _Section_ _1.5_ ), all amounts payable to such Company
Securityholder under the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; (v)
with respect to any claims for indemnification made by Parent hereunder, agree
to, object to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
demand litigation of and comply with orders and awards of courts with respect
to such claims; and (vi) to do or refrain from doing any further act or deed
on behalf of such Company Securityholder as is assigned, delegated or charged
to the Securityholders' Representative or that the Securityholders'
Representative otherwise deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion
relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Securityholders' Representative engagement agreement, as fully and completely
as such Company Securityholder could do if personally present. All such
actions set forth or described in this _Section_ _1.14(a)_ will be deemed to
be facts ascertainable outside this Agreement and will be binding on the
Company Securityholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholders'
Representative shall have no obligation to act on behalf of the Company
Securityholders, except as expressly provided herein and in the Escrow
Agreement the Securityholders' Representative engagement agreement, and for
purposes of clarity, there are no obligations of the Securityholders'
Representative in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) The appointment of the Securityholders' Representative and the powers,
immunities and rights to indemnification granted to the Securityholders'
Representative Group hereunder (i) are deemed coupled with an interest and are
irrevocable and survive the death, incompetence, bankruptcy or liquidation of
any Company Securityholder and shall be binding on any successor thereto, and
(ii) shall survive the delivery of any assignment by any Company
Securityholder of the whole or any fraction of his, her or its interest in the
Escrow Amount or Earn-out Amount. Parent, its Affiliates and any other Person
may conclusively and absolutely rely, without inquiry, upon any action of the
Securityholders' Representative on behalf of the Company Securityholders in
all matters referred to herein. All notices delivered by Parent or the Company
(following the Closing) to the Securityholders' Representative (whether
pursuant hereto or otherwise) for the benefit of the Company Securityholders
will constitute notice to the Company Securityholders. The Securityholders'
Representative will act for the Company Securityholders on all of the matters
set forth in this Agreement in the manner the Securityholders' Representative
believes to be in the best interest of the Company Securityholders as a whole
and consistent with its obligations under this Agreement, but the
Securityholders' Representative will not be responsible to the Company
Securityholders for any loss or damages it or they may suffer by reason of the
performance by the Securityholders' Representative of its duties under this
Agreement, other than loss or damage arising from fraud by the
Securityholders' Representative.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) If the Securityholders' Representative resigns, which it may do at any
time, or is otherwise similarly unable to carry out its duties hereunder, then
the Company Securityholders with an aggregate Pro Rata Portion of 50.1% (the "
_Requisite Company Securityholders_ ") will, within five Business Days,
appoint a new Securityholders' Representative. The Requisite Company
Securityholders may at any time, for any reason or no reason, remove the
Securityholders' Representative. If at any time there is not a
Securityholders' Representative and the Company Securityholders fail to
designate in writing a successor Securityholders' Representative within five
Business Days after receipt of a written request delivered by Parent to the
Requisite Company Securityholders requesting that a successor Securityholders'
Representative be designated in writing, then Parent may petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint a new Securityholders' Representative
hereunder. The immunities and rights to indemnification shall survive the
resignation or removal of the Securityholders' Representative or any member of
the Advisory Group and the Closing and/or any termination of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(d) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Securityholders'
Representative taken, made or given pursuant to the authority granted to the
Securityholders' Representative pursuant to this _Section 1.14_ , the Escrow
Agreement or the Securityholders' Representative engagement agreement will be
conclusive and binding upon each Company Securityholder and such Company
Securityholder's successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing
by such Company Securityholder, and no Company Securityholder will have the
right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. All defenses
which may be available to any Company Securityholder to contest, negate or
disaffirm the action of the Securityholders' Representative taken in good
faith in accordance with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
Securityholders' Representative engagement agreement are waived. Each Company
Stockholder, by the execution and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, each
Company Optionholder, by the execution and delivery of any Option Termination
Agreement, and each Company Warrantholder by the execution and delivery of any
Warrant Termination Agreement, will be deemed to have approved, confirmed and
ratified any action taken by the Securityholders' Representative in the
exercise of the power-of-attorney granted to the Securityholders'
Representative pursuant to this _Section 1.14_ , which power-of-attorney,
being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable and will survive the death,
incapacity or incompetence of each such Company Securityholder.

 



 

 



   



 

(e) The Securityholders' Representative Group will not be liable to the
Company Securityholders for any act done or omitted hereunder in its capacity
as the Securityholders' Representative unless caused by fraud by the
Securityholders' Representative. The Securityholders' Representative will not
have any fiduciary, agency or other duties to the Company Securityholders and
its only obligations will be as expressly set forth in this Agreement. The
Securityholders' Representative shall be entitled to: (i) rely upon the
Consideration Spreadsheet, (ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be
genuine, and (iii) reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization
to sign on behalf of the applicable Company Securityholder or other party. The
Securityholders' Representative is serving in that capacity solely for
purposes of administrative convenience, and is not personally liable for any
of the obligations of the Company Securityholders hereunder, and Parent and
the Company agree that they will not look to the underlying assets of the
Securityholders' Representative for the satisfaction of any obligations of the
Company Securityholders (or any of them). The Company Securityholders will
severally, in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Portions (and not
jointly), indemnify and defend the Securityholders' Representative Group and
hold the Securityholders' Representative Group on demand harmless against any
damages, losses, claims, liabilities, fees, costs, expenses, judgments, fines
or amounts paid in settlement incurred by the Securityholders' Representative
Group and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance, performance or
administration of the Securityholders' Representative duties hereunder , under
the Escrow Agreement, or under any Securityholders' Representative engagement
agreement including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal counsel,
accountants, auditors and other advisors or skilled professionals retained by
the Securityholders' Representative (collectively, the "Securityholders'
Representative Expenses"), in each case as such fees and expenses are
incurred, which rights will survive the resignation or removal of the
Securityholders' Representative. The Securityholders' Representative will be
entitled to retain its own counsel and other professional advisers in
connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of the
Securityholders' Representative's duties hereunder or under the Escrow
Agreement or the exercise of any of the Securityholders' Representative's
rights hereunder, and will further be entitled to withdraw from the
Securityholders' Representative Amount the amount of any fees and expenses of
such counsel and professionals, and in the event that the Securityholders'
Representative Amount has been fully depleted, the amount of such fees and
expenses may be withdrawn from any portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise
distributable to the Company Securityholders, at the time of such distribution
(provided, that nothing in this _Section_ _1.14(e)_ shall relieve the Company
Securityholders of their obligation to promptly pay such fees and expenses as
they are suffered or incurred, nor prevent the Securityholders' Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise). The Company
Securityholders acknowledge that the Securityholders' Representative shall not
be required to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial
liability in the exercise or performance of any of its powers, rights, duties
or privileges or pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Furthermore, the Securityholders'
Representative shall not be required to take any action unless the
Securityholders' Representative has been provided with funds, security or
indemnities which, in its reasonable determination, are sufficient to protect
the Securityholders' Representative against the costs, expenses and
liabilities which may be incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in
performing such actions. In the event of any ambiguity or uncertainty
hereunder, the Securityholders' Representative may, in its sole and reasonable
discretion, refrain from taking any action, unless the Securityholders'
Representative receives written instructions, signed by the Requisite Company
Securityholders, that eliminate such ambiguity or uncertainty.

 



 

 



   



 

(f) If (i) the Securityholders' Representative elects (1) to assume and
control the defense and/or management of any Third Party Claim at the expense
of Company Securityholders in accordance with _Section_ _8.1(f)_ hereof or (2)
to take any other action under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement that may
require the payment of amounts out of the Securityholders' Representative
Amount, including for any attorneys, accountants, auditors or other advisors,
and (ii) the Securityholders' Representative's good faith estimate of the
reasonable expenses to be incurred by the Securityholders' Representative in
connection with any such action exceeds the balance of the Securityholders'
Representative Amount, the Securityholders' Representative may refrain from
taking any such action until such time as the Securityholders' Representative,
upon seven days' notice to the Company Securityholders, receives written
commitments signed by the Requisite Company Securityholders for payment of
such expenses, in which case all Company Securityholders will pay their Pro
Rata Portion of such estimated expenses. Any such initial notice by the
Securityholders' Representative to the Company Securityholders will include a
statement of the balance of the Securityholders' Representative Amount, the
good faith estimate of the reasonable expenses to be incurred by the
Securityholders' Representative, the amount by which the estimated expenses to
be incurred exceed the balance of the Securityholders' Representative Amount,
and each Company Securityholder's Pro Rata Portion of such excess expense
amount. Each Company Securityholder will deliver its Pro Rata Portion of any
excess expense amount by wire transfer of immediately available funds, using
the wire instructions identified in any such initial notice, no later than ten
days following the date on which the Securityholders' Representative gives
such Company Securityholder notice of the receipt of commitments signed by the
Requisite Company Securityholders for payment of such excess expenses;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Securityholder will be required to
make any payments, individually or in the aggregate, pursuant to this
_Section_ _1.14(f)_ in excess of the Aggregate Merger Consideration previously
received by such Company Securityholder. Any amounts thus paid will increase
the balance of the Securityholders' Representative Amount. The
Securityholders' Representative may invest the Securityholders' Representative
Amount as it determines in its discretion.

 



 

(g) Certain Company Securityholders (the " _Advisory Group_ ") have
concurrently herewith entered into a letter agreement with Securityholders'
Representative regarding direction to be provided by the Advisory Group to
Securityholders' Representative in connection with its services under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Securityholders' Representative
engagement agreement. Neither the Securityholders' Representative nor its
members, managers, directors, officers, contractors, agents and employees nor
any member of the Advisory Group (collectively, the " _Securityholders '
Representative Group_") shall incur any liability to the Company
Securityholders while acting in good faith and arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder, under the
Escrow Agreement or under any Securityholders' Representative engagement
agreement (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith), even if
such act or omission constitutes negligence on the part of the Advisory Group
or one of its members. This indemnification and exculpation shall survive the
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

1.16 Tax Treatment. Absent a determination within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, no party
hereto shall take any action or filing position inconsistent with the
following characterizations: (i) the portions of the Escrow Amount and the
_Earn-out Amount_ allocable to the Company Stockholders are intended to be
treated as deferred contingent purchase price eligible for installment sale
treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provision of
non-U.S., state or local law, as appropriate, and (ii) the portions of the
Escrow Amount and the _Earn-out Amount_ allocable to Company Optionholders are
not intended to be compensation or wages, or subject to withholding as such,
unless and until such portions (or any part thereof) are distributed to
Company Optionholders.

 



 

1.17 Reallocation of Merger Consideration.

 



 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " _Total Nominal Merger Consideration_ " means (i) the Closing Merger
Consideration (net of the Aggregate Company Option Exercise Amount and
Aggregate Company Warrant Exercise Amount), (ii) _plus_ or _minus_ the
Positive Adjustment Amount or Negative Adjustment Amount, as applicable, and
(iii) _plus_ the First Earn-Out Payment, the Second Earn-Out Payment and/or
the Reduced Second Earn-Out Payment, as applicable.

 



 

(ii) " _Total Reallocated Merger Consideration_ " means the aggregate
amount of the Total Nominal Merger Consideration forfeited by holders of
Unvested Company Options following the Closing as a result of termination of
service (calculated after giving effect to any applicable acceleration
provisions).

 



 

(iii) " _Net Nominal Merger Consideration_ " means (i) the Total Nominal
Merger Consideration _minus_ (ii) the Total Reallocated Merger Consideration.

 



 

(iv) " _Reallocation Pro Rata Portion_ " means, with respect to a Company
Securityholder, a fraction measured as of the time of determining such Company
Securityholder's Reallocation Pro Rata Portion, the numerator of which is the
amount of the Net Nominal Merger Consideration such holder is entitled to
receive (including amounts previously paid) as of such determination date and
the denominator of which is the Net Nominal Merger Consideration all Company
Securityholders are entitled to receive (including amounts previously paid) as
of such determination date. For clarity, the foregoing calculation will be
made without regard to any amounts paid by the Company Securityholders to
satisfy indemnification claims of the Indemnified Persons or Securityholders'
Representative.

 



 

(b) No more than 30 days following the final determination of the
Second Earn-Out Payment or the Reduced Second Earn-Out Payment, as applicable,
Securityholders' Representative will calculate the Total Nominal Merger
Consideration, Total Reallocated Merger Consideration, Net Nominal Merger
Consideration and Reallocation Pro Rata Portion for each Company
Securityholder, and shall deliver to Parent an updated Consideration
Spreadsheet setting forth the Total Reallocated Merger Consideration payable
to each Company Securityholder. Promptly following the receipt of such updated
Consideration Spreadsheet, (i) with respect to that portion of the Total
Reallocated Merger Consideration payable to the Company Stockholders and
Company Warrantholders, Parent will deposit, or cause to be deposited with the
Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds for the benefit
of and distribution to the Company Stockholders and Company Warrantholders,
that portion of such Total Reallocated Merger Consideration payable to the
Company Stockholders and Company Warrantholders, and (ii) with respect to that
portion of the Total Reallocated Merger Consideration payable to the Company
Optionholders, Parent will deliver cash in an amount equal to the portion of
such Total Reallocated Merger Consideration payable to Company Optionholders
to the Surviving Corporation, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
for further distribution through the Surviving Corporation's payroll system,
_less_ any applicable income and employment withholding Taxes.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) The determination of the Reallocation Pro Rata Portion and the other
calculations required pursuant to _Section 1.17(b)_ are the sole
responsibility of the Company Securityholders, and the Company Securityholders
hereby agree that neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of Parent's
Affiliates, will have any responsibility or liability for any errors,
omissions or inaccuracies therein. Parent, its Affiliates and Paying Agent
will be entitled to rely on the accuracy of any Consideration Spreadsheet
relating to or resulting from such calculations in all respects, and Parent's
obligation to make any payments pursuant to this _Section 1.17_ will be deemed
fulfilled to the extent that Parent makes such payments in accordance with the
foregoing.

 



 

1.18 Merger Consideration. In no event shall Parent be required to pay
the Company Securityholders cash in an amount greater than the Aggregate
Closing Merger Consideration (for the avoidance of doubt, as adjusted pursuant
to Section 1.5 of this Agreement) _plus_ the Earn-Out Payments earned pursuant
to Section 1.6, if any, plus amounts payable by Parent pursuant to _Section 8_
, if any.

 



 

2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES REGARDING THE COMPANY. Except as disclosed in a disclosure schedule of even date herewith delivered by the Company to Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Company Disclosure Schedule_ "), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, as of the date hereof and provided the Closing occurs, as of the Closing, that the following statements are true and correct: 

 



 

2.1 Organization, Standing and Power. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State
of Delaware. The Company has the requisite corporate power to own, lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted.
The Company is duly qualified to do business, and is in good standing (if such
concept is applicable in the relevant jurisdiction), in each jurisdiction
where the operation of the Company's current business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to so qualify would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each jurisdiction where the Company is qualified to
do business is set forth in _Section_ _2.1_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule. The Company has posted in the Data Room true and correct copies of
the Company Charter and bylaws of the Company, in each case as in effect as of
the date of this Agreement.

 



 

2.2 Company Subsidiaries. With the exception of the Subsidiaries set
forth in _Section 2.2_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company
Subsidiaries_ "), the Company does not have any Subsidiaries. Each of the
Company Subsidiaries is wholly owned by the Company, duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, and
has the requisite corporate power to own, lease and operate its properties and
to carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of the Company
Subsidiaries is in good standing (if such concept is applicable in the
relevant jurisdiction). The Company has posted in the Data Room true and
correct copies of the organizational documents of each of the Company
Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

2.3 Power and Authority.

 



 

(a) The Company has all requisite power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and all documents contemplated hereby to which the
Company is a party or signatory, to consummate the Closing and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and
all documents contemplated hereby to which the Company is a party or
signatory, and the consummation by the Company of the Closing and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, have been
duly authorized and approved unanimously by the Company's board of directors,
and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, other than, with respect to the completion of the Merger, the Required
Stockholder Approval, which will be obtained prior to Closing pursuant to

2.7 Financial Statements; Internal Controls.

 



 

(a) Attached as _Section_ _2.7_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule are (i)
the audited consolidated balance sheets, statements of income and
shareholders' equity and statements of cash flows of the Company as of and for
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and (ii)(1) the
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of Company (the " _Company Balance Sheet_
") as of May 31, 2016 (the " _Company Balance Sheet Date_ ") and (2) the
unaudited consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash
flows for the five-month period ended on the Company Balance Sheet Date,
together with the notes to such financial statements (collectively, the "
_Company Financial Statements_ "). The Company Financial Statements (i) are
consistent in all material respects with the books and records of the Company;
(ii) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except that the unaudited
Company Financial Statements do not contain footnotes and are subject to
normal year-end adjustments) applied on a consistent basis throughout the
periods covered; and (iii) fairly present in all material respects in
accordance with GAAP financial position, results of income, shareholders'
equity and cash flows of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of the
dates indicated therein, subject to normal year-end adjustments and the
absence of footnotes in the case of the unaudited Company Financial
Statements. The statements of income included in the Company Financial
Statements do not contain any items of special or nonrecurring income or any
other income not earned in the ordinary course of business required to be
disclosed separately in accordance with GAAP, except as expressly specified in
the applicable statement of operations or notes thereto. The books of account
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries accurately reflect the Company's
and the Company Subsidiaries' items of income and expense and all assets and
liabilities and accruals that properly should have been reflected therein in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied throughout the periods covered
thereby except as disclosed in the Company Financial Statements. The Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have provided or made available to Parent copies
of all material written correspondence with their independent certified
accountants since January 1, 2014.

 



 

(b) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries maintains a system of
internal controls over financial reporting that provides reasonable assurance
that (i) records are maintained in reasonable detail and accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, respectively; (ii) receipts and expenditures and other
transactions are executed in accordance with the authorization of management;
(iii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability
for the assets and liabilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
respectively; and (iv) there is prevention or timely detection of the
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of assets of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries that would affect the Company's consolidated financial
statements. No significant deficiency or material weakness was identified in
management's assessment of internal controls as of December 31, 2015, nor has
any such deficiency or weakness since been identified.

 



 

 



   



 

2.8 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Neither the Company nor any of the
Company Subsidiaries has, or has incurred, any material liability or
obligation of any nature (whether direct or indirect, matured or unmatured, or
absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), except (a) as disclosed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule; (b) as reflected on the Company Balance Sheet;
(c) liabilities or obligations (other than obligations for borrowed money or
in respect of capitalized leases) incurred after the Company Balance Sheet
Date in the ordinary course of business; (d) liabilities for Specified
Transaction Expenses, (e) liabilities that in the aggregate do not exceed
$1,000,000.00, (f) liabilities that have arisen since the Agreement Date and
do not arise from a violation of _Section 4.1(a)-(u)_ , and (g) liabilities
under contracts of the Company and Company Subsidiaries that are set forth in
and identifiable by reference to the text of such contracts. For clarity, (x)
the representations and warranties in this _Section 2.8_ are not intended to,
and shall not be deemed to, address liabilities, the general subject matter of
which are addressed by the other representations and warranties in this
_Section 2_ (other than _Section 2._ _7_ _(_ _a_ _)_ ) (e.g., a third party
claim of infringement of Intellectual Property rights where the Company is not
actually guilty of such infringement in breach of _Section 2.14(d)_ shall not
be considered a liability covered by this _Section 2.8_ because infringement
of Intellectual Property Rights is already addressed by _Section 2.14(d_))
and (y) in the event that a third party claim involving the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is brought following the Closing, the mere existence of
such claim shall not, in and of itself, constitute a breach of this _Section
2.8_ on the grounds that the existence of such claim following the Closing
means that the matters underlying such claim by definition constituted
undisclosed, indirect, unmatured, unaccrued, unasserted, contingent or similar
liabilities as of the Closing or any time prior thereto.

 



 

2.9 Absence of Certain Developments. Except as set forth on _Section_
_2.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, or as otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement, from the Company Balance Sheet Date to the Agreement Date, (a) the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their respective business
only in the ordinary course of business; and (b) there has not been any
Company Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, from the Company Balance Sheet Date to the Agreement Date, neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has taken any action that, had
it been taken after the date of this Agreement, would be prohibited by the
terms of _Section_ _4.1_.

 



 

2.10 Inventory. To the Knowledge of the Company, except as set forth on
_Section_ _2.10_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the inventory of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in good and marketable condition and

business. The inventory of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries set forth
in the Company Balance Sheet and reflected in the Closing Date Net Working
Capital was valued at the lower of cost or market value (net realizable value)
and its value is stated therein in accordance with GAAP. Reserves have been
reflected in the Company Balance Sheet for obsolete, excess, damaged, slow-
moving or otherwise unusable inventory, which reserves were calculated in a
manner consistent with the GAAP. To the Knowledge of the Company, the
inventory of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries constitutes sufficient
quantities to conduct their respective business in the ordinary course of
business. All inventory of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is located
at Leased Real Property.

receivable of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries have arisen from _bona_
_fide_ transactions in the ordinary course of business consistent with GAAP.

arbitration or known investigation before any arbitrator, court or tribunal of
competent jurisdiction pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
as of the Agreement Date in writing against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or to which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is
otherwise a party. Except as set forth in _Section_ _2.12_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (i) neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries is subject to any judgment, ruling, order, writ, decree,
stipulation, injunction or determination as of the Agreement Date or in breach
or violation of any judgment, ruling, order, writ, decree, stipulation,
injunction or determination, (ii) as of the Agreement Date neither the Company
nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is engaged in any legal action to recover

Subsidiaries has been party or subject to any adverse judgment or settlement
of any Legal Proceeding in an amount exceeding $75,000 or that resulted in any
material non-monetary relief. To the extent allowed pursuant to any applicable
Legal Requirement, the Company has posted in the Data Room true, correct and
complete copies of all court submissions and correspondence relating to active
matters included in _Section 2.12_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

2.13 Restrictions on Business Activities. There is no agreement,
judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries that has, or would reasonably be expected to have, the
effect of materially prohibiting or materially impairing the conduct of the
business of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as currently
contemplated by the Company.

Company Subsidiaries' use or enforcement of any Owned Intellectual Property
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, Third Party Intellectual Property
(including any proceeding contesting the rights of the Company to any Business

their properties, assets, business or business practices (including the

Legal Requirement or made a material false statement or omission to any such
Governmental Authority.

of the products of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. To the
Company's Knowledge, there is no false or misleading information or material
omission in any product application or other submission to the FDA or any
comparable Governmental Authority. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have fulfilled and performed their obligations under each Permit, and to the

reimburse any employee for any income or excise Tax that may be assessed under
Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(i) Except as provided in _Section_ _2.24(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule or as provided in this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing,

other compensatory payment (including golden parachute, bonus or benefits
under any Company Employee Plan); or (ii) accelerate the time of payment or
vesting of any such benefits or increase the amount of compensation due to any
such employee or service provider (other than with respect to treatment of
outstanding equity or equity-based awards elsewhere contemplated in this
Agreement). No benefit payable or that may become payable by the Company
pursuant to any Company Employee Plan in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or as a result of or arising under this

(as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) subject to the imposition of an
excise Tax under Section 4999 of the Code or the deduction for which would be
disallowed by reason of Section 280G of the Code. No condition other than
applicable Legal Requirements exists that would prevent the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any Company Employee
Plan without liability to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries,
respectively (other than for benefits accrued at the time of termination). The
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have expressly reserved the right to
amend, modify or terminate any Company Employee Plan, or any portion of it,
and have made no representations (whether orally or in writing) that would
conflict with or contradict such reservation or right.

the representations and warranties in this Section 2.24 shall be the Company's
sole representations and warranties with respect to matters relating the
Company Employee Plans.

in this Agreement, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will not be
required to disclose any information to Parent if such disclosure would, in
the reasonable judgment of the Company: (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or
other privilege, or (ii) contravene any applicable Legal Requirements,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement, in each case so long as the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
have reasonably cooperated with Parent to permit such inspection of, or to
disclose such information on a basis that does not jeopardize such privilege
or contravene any such Legal Requirement, fiduciary duty or binding agreement.
No information received pursuant to an investigation made under this _Section_
_5.1_ will be deemed to (i) qualify, modify, waive, amend or otherwise affect
any representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements of the Company
set forth in this Agreement or any certificate or other instrument delivered
to Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) amend
or otherwise supplement the information set forth in the Company Disclosure
Schedule, (iii) limit or restrict the remedies available to the parties under
applicable Legal Requirements arising out of a breach of this Agreement, or
(iv) limit or restrict the ability of either party to invoke or rely on the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement set forth in _Section_ _6_ __ hereof.

 



 

 



   



 

5.2 Public Disclosure; Confidentiality.

 



 

(a) No party shall issue any press release or otherwise make any public
statement or make any other public (or non-confidential) disclosure (whether
or not in response to an inquiry) regarding the terms of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of each
of the Parent and the Securityholders' Representative. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Parent may include disclosures relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein in Parent's filings with the SEC, and
otherwise as required by the SEC and Nasdaq, without seeking approval from, or
consulting with, any other parties hereto; _provided_ , that Parent will make
good faith efforts to provide the Company and, after the Closing, the
Securityholders' Representative with written notice of any such disclosures,
except to the extent that any such disclosures are substantially similar to
the information contained in previous public disclosures made by Parent.

 



 

(b) The terms of that certain Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated May
15, 2015, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")
are hereby incorporated herein by reference and will continue in full force
and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement
will terminate. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will nonetheless continue in full force
and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(c) From and after the date hereof, the Securityholders' Representative
will not, and will cause its directors, officers, employees, Representatives
and Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or
communicate to any Person, or use or otherwise exploit for their own benefit
or for the benefit of anyone, any Confidential Information (as that term is
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement). The Securityholders' Representative
will not have any obligation to keep confidential (or cause its directors,
officers, employees, Representatives and Affiliates to keep confidential) any
Confidential Information if and to the extent that disclosure thereof is
specifically required by applicable Legal Requirements; _provided_ , _however_
, that in the event that disclosure is required by applicable Legal
Requirements, the Securityholders' Representative will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, provide Parent and the Company
with prompt notice of such requirement prior to making any disclosure so that
the applicable party may seek an appropriate protective order; _provided_
_further_ , disclosure may be made to the extent any information is necessary
for enforcing the rights of the Company Securityholders or Securityholders'
Representative arising out of this Agreement or defending against assertions
by Parent as disclosed to any Governmental Authority or other involved party (
_e.g._ , opposing counsel, expert witnesses, investigators) in connection with
any dispute resolution proceedings involving a dispute between Parent, on the
one hand, and the Company Securityholders or the Securityholders'
Representative, on the other hand, arising out of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 



   



 

5.3 Efforts; Government Approvals and Further Assurances.

 



 

(a) Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary
or appropriate to consummate the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to _Section 5.3(b)_ , each of Parent, Merger Sub,
and the Company will execute and deliver such further instruments of
conveyance and transfer and take such additional actions as any other party
may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm, or evidence the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will: (i)
make any filings and give any notices required to be made or given by such
party in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
consummation of the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consent required to be
obtained by such party in connection with this Agreement, the consummation of
the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub, and the Company will promptly deliver to the other a copy of each
such filing made (other than filings made pursuant to the HSR Act), each such
notice given and each such consent obtained during the Pre-Closing Period, it
being understood that delivery of such filings, notices and consents
exclusively to the outside counsel of such other party will be deemed to be in
compliance with the requirements of this _Section_ _5.3(a)_. The initial
filings pursuant to the HSR Act will be made by Parent and the Company within
five Business Days following the Agreement Date.

 



 

(b) The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the
authorizations, consents, orders and approvals necessary for their execution
and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant to, this
Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company will use their reasonable best
efforts to (i) file, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, all notices, reports and other documents required to be filed by
such party with any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement, the
consummation of the Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
and (ii) to submit promptly any additional information requested by any such
Governmental Authority. Each of Parent and the Company will pay 50% of any
filing fee under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement or otherwise to the contrary, each of Parent,
Merger Sub, and the Company hereby covenants and agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to secure prompt termination of any waiting periods imposed by
the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws and to comply at the earliest practicable
date with any request under the HSR Act to provide information, documents or
other materials requested by any Governmental Authority. Each of the Company
and Parent will (A) give the other party prompt notice of the commencement of
any legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority with respect to
this Agreement, the consummation of the Closing and the other transactions
contemplated hereby; and (B) keep the other party informed as to the status of
any such legal proceeding. The Company and Parent will consult and cooperate
with one another, and will consider in good faith the views of one another, in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted by either of them in
connection with any legal proceeding under or relating to national security
matters.

 



 

 



   



 

(c) For the purposes of this _Section_ _5.3_ , "reasonable best efforts"
of Parent will not require (nor will anything in this _Section_ _5.3_ or
otherwise in this Agreement require) Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to take
any action that would prohibit or limit in any respect, or place any
conditions on, the ownership or operation by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries of any portion of the business or assets
of Parent, the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of Parent's
Subsidiaries, or compel Parent, the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries,
or any of Parent's Subsidiaries, to dispose of, hold separate or license any
portion of the business, assets or Intellectual Property of Parent, the
Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, or any of Parent's Subsidiaries,
respectively, in each case as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In no event will Parent, the Company, any of the Company
Subsidiaries, or any of Parent's Subsidiaries be obligated to propose or agree
to accept any undertaking or condition, to enter into any consent decree or
hold separate order, to make any divestiture or to accept any operational
restriction or limitation. With regard to any Governmental Authority, the
Company will not, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, without
Parent's prior written consent in Parent's sole discretion, discuss or commit
to any divestiture transaction, or discuss or commit to alter its business or
commercial practices in any way, or otherwise discuss, take or commit to take
any action that limits Parent's freedom of action with respect to, or Parent's
ability to retain any of Parent's, the Company's, or the Company Subsidiaries'
respective businesses, product lines or assets or otherwise receive the full
benefits of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent has the unilateral right to determine whether or not the
parties will litigate with any Governmental Authority to oppose any
enforcement action or remove any court or regulatory orders impeding the
ability to consummate the Merger. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the obligations of Parent, its Subsidiaries and Merger Sub hereunder will
not include any requirement to defend any proceeding challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Closing beyond the Outside Date.

 



 

5.4 Tax Matters.

 



 

(a) Cooperation on Tax Matters. Parent and the Securityholders'
Representative will cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested
by another party, in connection with the filing of (i) any Tax Return or
amended Tax Return with respect to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date, (ii) audit, or (iii) litigation or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes. Such cooperation will include the retention and (upon the other
party's reasonable request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, audit, litigation or other
proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the
Securityholders' Representative will (i) retain all books and records with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of
limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or the Company, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) give the
other parties reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if any other party so requests,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, will allow the other
parties to take possession of such books and records. Parent and the
Securityholders' Representative further agree, upon request, to use their
reasonable best efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate,
reduce or eliminate any Tax of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Company Subsidiaries or Parent that could be imposed (including with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, Securityholders' Representative shall have
no obligation to prepare or file any Tax Return.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Pre-Closing Tax Returns. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries
will prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all
Tax Returns relating to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
respectively, that are required to be filed on or before the Closing Date
(taking into account all applicable extensions to file any such Tax Return),
which Tax Returns will be prepared in accordance with past practices and
customs. The Company will provide Parent with copies of such Tax Returns.

 



 

(c) Tax Audits and Contests.

 



 

(i) Unless Parent has previously received notice from the Securityholders'
Representative of the existence of any Tax Contest (as defined below), Parent
will, or will cause the Company to, promptly notify the Securityholders'
Representative of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events
with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle
Period for which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or the Company
Securityholders may be liable under this Agreement (such inquiry, claim,
assessment, audit or similar event, a " _Tax Contest_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no failure to give such notice will relieve the Company
Securityholders of any liability hereunder except to the extent, if any, that
the rights of the Company Securityholders with respect to such claim are
materially actually prejudiced thereby. Except with respect to income Tax
Returns (or information Tax Returns related to income Taxes) for taxable
periods of the Company ending on or before the Closing Date, Parent will have
the authority to represent the interests of the Company and will have control
of the defense, compromise or other resolution of any Tax Contest; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Securityholders' Representative will be entitled to
participate in such Tax Contest at the Company Securityholders' expense and
Parent will not settle, compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax
Contest that is reasonably likely to materially affect the Tax liability of
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, or the Company Securityholders for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, or to form the basis for a claim of indemnification
pursuant to _Section_ _8.1(b),_ without the written consent of
Securityholders' Representative, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Securityholders' Representative will
have the authority, at the Company Securityholders' expense, to represent the
interests of the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and the Company
Securityholders and will have control of the defense, compromise or other
resolution of any Tax Contest to the extent that such Tax Contest involves Tax
Returns (or information Tax Returns) related to income Taxes or Taxes in the
nature of Taxes on net income for taxable periods of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent will be entitled to participate in such Tax Contest at
its own expense and the Securityholders' Representative will not settle,
compromise and/or concede any portion of such Tax Contest that is reasonably
likely to materially affect the Tax liability of the Company or Parent for any
taxable period (or portion thereof) occurring after the Closing Date without
the written consent of Parent, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) If Parent or the Securityholders' Representative elects, by written
notice to the other party, not to control the defense of a Tax Contest that it
has authority to control, the other party may assume control of the defense of
such Tax Contest. In such event, the party electing not to control the defense
of such Tax Contest (the " _Non-Controlling Party_ ") will be given the
opportunity to participate in, but not direct or conduct, any defense of such
Tax Contest, unless such participation would affect any privilege of the party
controlling the defense of such Tax Contest (the " _Controlling Party_ "). The
Non-Controlling Party's participation under such circumstances will be subject
to the Controlling Party's right to control such defense. The Controlling
Party will not settle any such Tax Contest without the consent of the Non-
Controlling Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. The Controlling Party will (i) keep the Non-Controlling Party
advised of the status of such claim and the defense thereof (including all
material developments and events relating thereto) and will consider in good
faith recommendations made by the Non-Controlling Party with respect thereto
and (ii) make available to the Non-Controlling Party any documents or
materials in its possession or control that may be necessary to understand the
defense of such claim (subject to protection of the attorney-client
privilege). The Non-Controlling Party will furnish the Controlling Party with
such information as it may have with respect to such Tax Contest (including
copies of any summons, complaints or other pleadings that may have been served
on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other
document evidencing or asserting the same) and will otherwise reasonably
cooperate with and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Tax
Contest.

 



 

5.5 Indemnification of Directors and Officers of Company.

 



 

(a) Prior to or as of the Closing, the Company will cause coverage to be
extended under the director and officer insurance policy (or policies)
maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any
actions or omissions by any current or former officers or directors of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_")
occurring prior to the Closing, by obtaining a related "tail" policy that has
an effective term of six years from the Closing Date, with coverage in amount
and scope at least as favorable as the Company's existing coverage. The cost
of such tail policy will be treated as a Specified Transaction Expense of the
Company. Parent will not, or will cause the Surviving Corporation to not,
cancel or change such insurance policies in any respect.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) In addition, for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree to indemnify and hold harmless,
reimburse, exculpate from liability, and advance expenses to all DandO
Indemnified Parties to the same extent and on the same terms as such persons
are entitled to indemnification, reimbursement, exculpation or expense
advancement by Company or any such Company Subsidiary as of the Agreement
Date, whether pursuant to applicable documents (including the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent governing documents) of any
Subsidiary), individual indemnification agreements, by Legal Requirement or
otherwise, for acts or omissions or matters which occurred or arose at or
prior to the Effective Time (regardless of whether any proceeding relating to
any DandO Indemnified Party's rights to indemnification, exculpation, or expense
advancement with respect to any such matters, acts, or omissions is commenced
before or after the Closing); provided that no DandO Indemnified Party may seek
indemnification, reimbursement, exculpation, or advancement of expenses from
Parent or the Surviving Corporation for amounts such DandO Indemnified Party
owes or may owe to any Parent or the Surviving Corporation in such DandO
Indemnified Party's capacity as Company Securityholder under the provisions
set forth in Section 8 (Escrow and Indemnification). Any claims for
indemnification made under this Section 5.5 on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time shall survive until the final resolution
thereof.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its successors to, pay all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by any DandO Indemnified Party (or his or
her heirs, personal representatives, successors, or assigns) in any legal
action brought by such person that is successful to enforce the obligations of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or its successors under this _Section 5.5_.
The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, and its successors under
this _Section 5._ _5_ shall not be terminated, amended, or otherwise modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any DandO Indemnified Party (or his or
her heirs, personal representatives, successors, or assigns) without the prior
written consent of such DandO Indemnified Party (or his or her heirs, personal
representatives, successors, or assigns, as applicable).

 



 

5.6 Parachute Payments. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
date of this Agreement, but in no event later than five Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, the Company will solicit Company Stockholder approval (in
compliance with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder) of the right of any individual who is or could reasonably be
expected to be, as of the Closing Date, a "disqualified individual" (as
defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code) to receive payments and benefits that
could be deemed a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the
Code), and shall obtain any necessary consents from such disqualified
individuals to waive such "parachute payments," to the extent such Company
Stockholder approval is not obtained. To the extent any "parachute payments"
are not approved as contemplated by this _Section_ _5.6_ , such "parachute
payments" shall not be made or provided.

 



 

 



   



 

5.7 Stockholder Action.

 



 

(a) The Company's board of directors has declared this Agreement, the
Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, advisable and
approved a resolution recommending approval of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the Company
Stockholders (the " _Board Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(b) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Company will, in accordance with and pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL, take
all action necessary to seek and obtain, as soon as practicable, written
consents from all Company Stockholders, in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit H_ (the " _Stockholder Written Consents_ "). Prior to the delivery of
the Stockholder Written Consents to the Company Stockholders, the Company must
have given Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity (but in no event
fewer than two Business Days prior to delivery to the Company Stockholders) to
review and comment on the proposed Stockholder Written Consents and all
related information proposed to be provided in connection therewith. No
amendment or supplement (including any incorporated by reference) to the
Stockholder Written Consents or any of such related information will be made
without the approval of Parent. As soon as practicable following the Company's
receipt of Stockholder Written Consents, the Company will deliver to Parent
copies of such Stockholder Written Consents.

 



 

(c) Within one Business Day after the date hereof, the Company will
deliver to Parent Stockholder Written Consents, duly executed by Company
Stockholders holding sufficient Company Voting Stock to provide the Required
Stockholder Approval.

 



 

(d) Following receipt of the Required Stockholder Approval, the Company
will promptly deliver to each holder of Company Shares a notice of the
approval of the Merger and this Agreement by written consent of the holders of
Company Shares pursuant to the applicable provisions of the DGCL, which notice
must include the required notice to holders of Company Shares required by
applicable Legal Requirements that appraisal rights may be available to
holders of Company Shares in accordance with the DGCL. Prior to the delivery
of such notice to the Company Stockholders, the Company must have given Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity (but in no event fewer than two
Business Days prior to delivery to the Company Stockholders) to review and
comment on the proposed notice and all related information proposed to be
provided in connection therewith.

 



 

5.8 Notification of Certain Matters.

 



 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company will, upon becoming aware
of any of the following, promptly notify Parent (i) if any representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement was, when made, or at any time
thereafter became (or would have become, but for any limitation set forth in
such representation or warranty as to the date on which such representation or
warranty is, was, or will be made), untrue or inaccurate in any respect that
would reasonably be expected to result in the condition set forth in Section
6.2(b) to not be satisfied; (ii) if the occurrence of any event, fact, change,
condition or circumstance has caused or would reasonably be expected to cause
any condition to the obligations of Parent to effect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; (iii) of the failure of
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to comply with or satisfy any
covenant or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this
Agreement that would reasonably be expected to result in the condition set
forth in Section 6.2(c) to not be satisfied; or (iv) of the institution or
threat of any legal proceeding against the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(the events, facts and circumstances and failures described in clauses (i) -
(iv), individually and collectively, the " _Post-Signing Events_ ").

 



 

 



   



 

(b) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ _5.8_ will not
be deemed to modify the representations and warranties in _Section_ _2_ for
purposes of _Section_ _6.2_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that if a Post-Signing
Event is disclosed to Parent in writing in accordance with this _Section_
_5.9_ , such Post-Signing Event constitutes or would constitute a failure of a
condition contained in _Section_ _6.2(b)_ or _(c)_ to be met, and Company
notifies Parent in writing that, as a result of such Post-Signing Event, there
is a failure of a condition contained in _Section_ _ 6.2(b)_ or _(c)_ ,
Parent will have a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _
7.1(d)_.

 



 

(c) For clarity, unintentional failure to give notice under _Section
5.8(a)_ shall not be deemed to be a breach of covenant under this _Section
5.8_ and shall constitute only a breach of the underlying representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement or condition, as the case may be. For clarity,
any breach or violation of the notification required under the parenthetical
clause in Section 5.8(a)(i) will not result in any monetary or other liability
of the Company or Company Securityholders.

 



 

5.9 Termination of Company Options and Company Warrants. During the
Pre-Closing Period, the Company will take actions reasonably necessary and
sufficient in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements, and, as
applicable, the Company Equity Incentive Plan and each Company Option and
Company Warrant (in each case, including using commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all of the Option Termination Agreements and the Warrant Termination
Agreements with respect to the outstanding Company Options and Company
Warrants and other necessary consents, and obtaining approval of its board of
directors) (a) to give effect to the actions contemplated by _Sections 1.13_
and _1.14_ ; and (b) to automatically terminate, as of the Effective Time, the
Company Equity Incentive Plan, all Company Options (including any underlying
agreements relating to the Company Options), and all Company Warrants
(including any underlying agreements relating to the Company Warrants), such
that at the Effective Time and upon the payments contemplated by _Sections
1.13_ and _1.14_ (and, if applicable, _Section 1.17_ ), no Person will have
any right to purchase or receive any equity or payment interest, or right
convertible into or exercisable for any equity or payment interest, of the
Company.

 



 

5.10 Letters of Transmittal and Other Agreements. During the Pre-Closing
Period, the Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to
Parent (a) Letters of Transmittal from each of the Company Stockholders; (b)
Option Termination Agreements from each of the Company Optionholders; (c)
Warrant Termination Agreement from each of the Company Warrantholders, and (c)
such other agreements and instruments necessary to satisfy the conditions to

5.11 No Solicitation or Negotiation.

 



 

(a) The Company acknowledges that neither it, nor its Representatives, is
engaged in any discussions or negotiations with any Person with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal and confirms that the Company has complied with, and is
in current compliance with, the exclusivity obligations under that certain
letter agreement, dated May 20, 2016, between Parent and the Company. The
Company will not, and will not authorize or permit its Representatives to,
directly or indirectly, from the date hereof until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_Section_ _7_ : (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or knowingly encourage an
Acquisition Proposal; or (ii) (A) furnish or disclose to any Person non-public
information with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; (B) negotiate or engage
in discussions with any Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal; or (C)
enter into or amend or grant any waiver or release under any confidentiality
or non-disclosure Contract with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) The Company's board of directors will not: (i) withdraw, amend, or
modify, or propose to withdraw, modify, or qualify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub, the Board Recommendation; (ii) approve, recommend, or
fail to recommend against, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal; (iii) make any statement inconsistent with its recommendation that
the Company Stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger; or
(iv) enter into any contract (whether or not binding) or agreement in
principle with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(c) The Company will promptly (and in any event within one Business Day
after receipt thereof by such party or its Representatives) advise Parent in
writing of any Acquisition Proposal, any request for information with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry with respect to or that would
reasonably be expected to result in an Acquisition Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry, but
excluding the identity of the Person making the same.

 



 

5.12 Affiliate Agreements. Prior to the Closing, the Company will use
reasonable best efforts to take actions reasonably necessary and sufficient to
cause to be terminated at the Effective Time the agreements set forth on
_Schedule_ _5.12_.

one or more DVDs that contain the true, correct and complete contents of the

Time of any notice of intent to demand the fair value of any Company Shares
under the DGCL and any withdrawal of any such notice. The Company will not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand at any time before the
Effective Time.

Agreement pursuant to _Section_ _7.1(b)_ , by the Company if (i) there is a
material breach of any of the representations or warranties of Parent in this
Agreement such that the condition set forth in _Section_ _6.3(a)_ would not be

7.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided in _Section_ _7.1_ , this Agreement will be of no
further force or effect, and there will be no liability on the part of Parent
or the Company or their respective officers, directors, shareholders or
members, except to the extent that such liability results from any prior
willful breach by a party of any of its covenants, agreements or
representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the provisions of _Section_ _9_ and the Confidentiality
Agreement will remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of
this Agreement.

 



 

8. Escrow and Indemnification.

 



 

8.1 Indemnification.

 



 

(a) Expiration of Representations, Warranties, and Covenants. The right to
bring a claim for breach of any of the representations and warranties made by
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement will survive the Closing
until the 18 month anniversary of the Closing Date, at which time such
representations and warranties will expire and terminate and be of no further
force and effect; _provided_ , _however_ , that such right to bring a claim
for breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in _Section_
_2.1_ (Organization, Standing and Power), _Section_ _2.2_ (Company
Subsidiaries), _Section_ _2.3_ (Power and Authority), _Section_ _2.4_
(Capitalization), _Section 2.23_ (Taxes) (with respect to income tax matters
only), _Section_ _2.30_ (Brokers' and Finders' Fee), _Section_ _3.1_
(Organization, Standing and Power), _Section_ _3.2_ (Authorization and Binding
Obligation of Parent), _Section_ _3.4_ (Brokers), _Section_ _8.1(e)(xiii)_ ,
and the representations in or incorporated by reference into any Joinder
Agreement, Option Termination Agreement, Warrant Termination Agreement,
Stockholder Written Consent or Letter of Transmittal relating to authority to
enter into and deliver such document(s) and title to the applicable Company
Securities (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ "), will survive
the Closing until the 30th day after expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the underlying subject matter of such
representations and warranties, at which time such right will expire and
terminate and be of no further force and effect (the date of expiration of any
representation or warranty in this Agreement being a " _Representation
Termination Date_ "). The covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement
(i) that contemplate performance on or before the Closing will continue in
full force and effect after the Closing until the 18-month anniversary of the
Closing Date and (ii) that contemplate performance after the Closing will
continue in full force and effect after the Closing in accordance with their
terms until fully performed (the applicable date of expiration of any covenant
in this Agreement being a " _Covenant Termination Date_ "). No claim for a
breach of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement may be
made after the expiration of the Representation Termination Date of such
representation or warranty, and no claim for a breach of any covenant
contained in this Agreement may be made after the expiration of the Covenant
Termination Date of such covenant, and no claim pursuant to clauses (iii)-(v)
of _Section 8.1(b)_ may be made after the fifth anniversary of the Closing
Date (the " _Special Indemnity Termination Date_ ") in each case (A) except
for claims of which a party has received written notification (each, an "
_Indemnification Claim Notice_ ") prior to such expiration setting forth in
reasonable detail the nature of such claim (including a reasonable
specification of the legal and factual basis for such claim) and (B) any claim
that is brought by the indemnifying party as a counterclaim to a claim brought
in accordance with the prior clause (A). If a party has sent an
Indemnification Claim Notice to another party within the time period
prescribed by this subsection (a), such claim will not be extinguished by the
passage of such time period and will survive until such claim has been fully
and finally resolved. The Company and the Company Securityholders waive any
statute of limitations to the extent shorter than the claim periods specified
in this subsection (a). The parties acknowledge that the time periods set
forth in this _Section_ _8.1(a)_ for the assertion of claims under this
Agreement are the result of arms'-length negotiation among the parties and
that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.

 



 

 



   



 

(b) Indemnification for Company Representations and Covenants. Subject to
the limitations set forth in _Section_ _8.1(a)_ , this _Section_ _8.1(b)_ and
_Section_ _s_ ___8.1(e)_ through _(h)_ , from and after the Closing Date, the
Company Securityholders, severally (and not jointly) based on their respective
Pro Rata Portions, will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent and its
Affiliates and their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
agents, Representatives, successors in interest and assigns (each of the
foregoing being referred to individually as an " _Indemnified Person_ " and
collectively as " _Indemnified Persons_ ") from, against and in respect of,
any and all Damages imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by any
Indemnified Person, whether or not due to a third-party claim, arising out of,
resulting from or in connection with (as determined by final, non-appealable
order of a court of competent jurisdiction or by written agreement of the
Securityholders' Representative and the Parent): (i) any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section _ _1.3(b)_ or
_Section _ _6.2_ hereunder; (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of
the Company set forth in this Agreement to be performed at or prior to the
Closing; (iii) any claim by a Company Securityholder regarding the
distribution of payments hereunder among Company Securityholders that differs
from that specified in the Closing Consideration Spreadsheet (as updated);
(iv) demands by Company Securityholders asserting appraisal rights or any
similar claim that result in payment to such Company Securityholder and
associated defense costs in the aggregate in excess of the applicable portion
of the Aggregate Merger Consideration they would have otherwise received under
this Agreement; (v) claims by Company Securityholders relating to breaches of
fiduciary duties by the directors and officers of the Company in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(excluding any aider and abettor liability of Parent or Merger Sub related
thereto).

 



 

(c) Indemnification for Company Securityholder Representations and
Covenants. In addition to the indemnification obligations of the Company
Securityholders set forth in _Section_ _8.1(b)_ , but subject to the
limitations set forth in _Section_ _8.1(a)_ , this _Section_ _8.1(c)_ and
_Section_ _s_ ___8.1(e)_ through _(h)_ , from and after the Closing Date, each
Company Securityholder, severally (and not jointly), will indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Indemnified Persons from, against and in respect of, any
and all Damages imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by any Indemnified
Person, whether or not due to a third-party claim, arising out of, resulting
from or in connection with (as determined by final, non-appealable order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or by written agreement of the
Securityholders' Representative and the Parent): (i) any breach of, or
inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty made by such Company
Securityholder set forth in any Joinder Agreement, Letter of Transmittal,
Stockholder Written Consent, any Option Termination Agreement, and/or any
Warrant Termination Agreement to which such Company Securityholder is a party;
and (ii) the breach of any covenant or agreement of such Company
Securityholder set forth in any Joinder Agreement, Letter of Transmittal,
Stockholder Written Consent, any Option Termination Agreement, and/or Warrant
Termination Agreement to which such Company Securityholder is a party.

 



 

 



   



 

(d) Indemnification for Parent and Merger Sub Representations and
Covenants. From and after the Closing Date, Parent will indemnify, defend and
hold harmless each Company Securityholder and its shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, successors in interest and assigns from, against
and in respect of, any and all Damages imposed on, sustained, incurred or
suffered by them, directly or indirectly, whether or not due to a third-party
claim, arising out of, resulting from or in connection with (as determined by
final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction or by written
agreement of the Securityholders' Representative and the Parent): (i) any
breach of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty of Parent and
Merger Sub set forth in _Section_ _3_ of this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered pursuant to _Section _ _1.3(a)_ or _Section _ _6.3_ hereunder, and
(ii) the breach of any covenant of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement.

 



 

(e) Limitations of Liability.

 



 

(i) Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Except as provided in _Sections_ _1.5_ ,
_1.6(e)_ , _8.1(e)(v)_ and _9.6_ , the right of the parties to be indemnified
pursuant to this _Section_ _8_ will be the sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to all monetary Damages under this Agreement and with respect to a
particular Company Securityholder, under any Joinder Agreement, Letter of
Transmittal, Stockholder Written Consent, Option Termination Agreement, and/or
Warrant Termination Agreement to which such Company Securityholder is a party.
For clarity, this means (a) that the survival periods and liability limits set
forth in this _Section_ _8_ shall control notwithstanding any statutory or
common law provisions or principles to the contrary, (b) all applicable
statutes of limitations or other claims periods with respect to claims for
Damages shall be shortened or lengthened to the applicable claims periods and
survival periods set forth herein, and (c) Parent and the Indemnified Persons
irrevocably waive any and all rights they may have to make claims against any
Company Securityholders under statutory and common law as a result of any
Damages and any and all other damages incurred by them with respect to this
Agreement (and with respect to a particular Company Securityholder, under any
Joinder Agreement, Letter of Transmittal, Stockholder Written Consent, Option
Termination Agreement, and/or Warrant Termination Agreement to which such
Company Securityholder is a party) whether or not in excess of the maximum
amounts permitted to be recovered pursuant to this _Section 8_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section_ _8_ will limit any
party's right to seek and obtain specific performance or injunctive relief to
which any party may be entitled or to seek any remedy on account of any
party's intentional fraud (i.e., with scienter) (for clarity, the dollar
liability limit of any Company Securityholder with respect to any such
intentional fraud committed by the Company will remain limited to the Upper
Cap).

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) Deductible. Subject to _Sections_ _8.1(e)(v)_ and _9.6_ and without
limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this Agreement, the
indemnification obligations of the Company Securityholders provided for in
_Section_ _8.1(b)_ _(i)_ will not apply, and the Indemnified Persons will not
be entitled to exercise any indemnification rights under this Agreement,
unless and until the aggregate amount of the Damages against which such
Indemnified Persons would otherwise be entitled to be indemnified under
_Section_ _8.1(b)_ _(i)_ exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), after
which the Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to indemnification for all of
their Damages in excess of the Deductible; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Deductible will not apply to any Excluded Matters.

 



 

(iii) Cap. Subject to _Sections_ _8.1(e)(v)_ and _9.6_ and without
limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this Agreement, the
Company Securityholders' indemnity obligations for Damages under _Section_
_8.1(b)_ _(i)_ and _Section_ _8.1(c)_ _(i)_ will be limited, in the aggregate,
to the Escrow Amount (which will constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
therefor) (the " _Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Cap will not
apply to any Excluded Matters. Subject to _Sections_ _8.1(e)(v)_ and _9.6_ and
without limiting the effect of any other limitation contained in this
Agreement, each Company Securityholder's indemnity obligations for Damages
with respect to the Excluded Matters (other than under _Section_ _8.1(e)(v)_ )
will be limited, in the aggregate, to the amount of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration actually received by such Company Securityholder (inclusive of
the Escrow Amount and Securityholders' Representative Amount) (the " _Upper
Cap_ ").

 



 

(iv) Materiality. For purposes of calculating Damages hereunder, any
reference to materiality or Company Material Adverse Effect in the
representations and warranties will be disregarded. For clarity, any such
reference will not be disregarded for purposes of determining whether a breach
of, or inaccuracy in, any representation or warranty exists.

 



 

(v) Fraud and Criminal Actions. Nothing in this Agreement will limit the
liability of any party hereto or any Company Securityholder with respect to
intentional fraud or intentional material criminal actions personally
committed by such Person.

 



 

(vi) Applicability of Limitations. The right to indemnification or any
other remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
contained in this Agreement will not be affected by any investigation
conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired, capable of being acquired,
or that is alleged the other party should have known, at any time, whether
before or after the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy
of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreements, will not affect the right to indemnification or
any other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements.

 



 

(vii) Calculation of Damages. Any claim for Damages will be calculated:
(i) as to actual losses and out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
Parent or any other Indemnified Person, without regard to reductions or
diminutions in value, lost opportunities or other speculative damages; (ii)
without regard to any punitive, exemplary, special, incidental, or
consequential damages unless (x) any such punitive, exemplary, special,
incidental, or consequential damages are actually awarded to a third party by
a Governmental Authority or (y) in the case of special or consequential
damages only, any such special or consequential damages are reasonably
foreseeable under an objective standard; and (iii) such that costs and
expenses (including those incurred in investigating, defending or resolving
any applicable third-party claim) shall constitute Damages if and solely to
the extent that such underlying claim is indemnifiable hereunder (without
taking into account such costs and expenses when determining whether such
underlying claim is indemnifiable hereunder).

 



 

 



   



 

(viii) Primacy of Escrow Account. Claims for Damages under _Section_ _
8_, other than _Section_ _8.1(c)_ , that have been resolved in favor of Parent
shall be recovered, first, from the Escrow Amount, and, only after the Escrow
Amount has been exhausted, then pursuant to _Section_ _1.6(e)_ and then, only
if _Section_ _1.6(e)_ is no longer applicable, directly from the Company
Securityholders.

 



 

(ix) Other Limitations. Any claim for indemnification under _Section_
___8_ other than _Section_ _8.1(c)_ , and any offer to compromise or settle
such claim, must be made on a pro rata basis to all Company Securityholders
(based on their respective Pro Rata Portions).

 



 

(x) Taxes. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Company Securityholders shall not have any liability or indemnification
obligation for any Taxes of Company (i) resulting from any election made under
Section 338 of the Code with respect to the Merger, (ii) with respect to any
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, (iii)
resulting from any action taken by the Company after the Closing on the
Closing Date or (iv) based on the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their affiliates to utilize any net operating loss, net capital
loss, investment Tax credit, foreign Tax credit, charitable deduction or other
credit or Tax attribute that could be carried forward or back to reduce Taxes
(including deductions and credits related to alternative minimum Taxes) in any
Tax period or portion thereof (including any Straddle Period).

 



 

(xi) No Liability for Others. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in no event will any Company Securityholder be liable for any other
Company Securityholder's breach of such other Company Securityholder's
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements contained in any Joinder
Agreement, Letter of Transmittal, Stockholder Written Consent, Option
Termination Agreement, and/or Warrant Termination Agreement, or other
ancillary agreement hereto to which such other Company Securityholder is a
party.

 



 

(xii) Pre-Closing Period. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event a
matter arises between the Agreement Date and the Closing Date (other than as a
result of intentional fraud by the Company under this Agreement) and thereby
results in a failure of a representation or warranty of the Company contained
in this Agreement or in the certificate described in _Section 6.2(a)_ , such
failure shall not be deemed to be intentional fraud with respect to such
representation or warranty (for example, because the Company may not legally
effectively update the Company Disclosure Schedule), unless and to the extent
actions of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries relating to any such matter
would otherwise constitute intentional fraud.

 



 

 



   



 

(xiii) Independent Investigation; Non-Reliance. In entering into this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that they have relied solely upon
their own independent investigation, review and analysis and not on any
factual representations or warranties or opinions of Company or its
representatives (except for the representations and warranties contained in
_Section 2_ ). Except for the representations and warranties contained in
_Section 2_ , Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that none of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives nor any other Person makes any other express, implied or
statutory representation or warranty with respect to the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, the Merger or otherwise, including any implied warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, enforceability or
non-infringement or with respect to any projections, estimates and budgets for
Company. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that there are assumptions inherent
in making any such projections, estimates and budgets, Parent and Merger Sub
are familiar with such uncertainties and that Parent and Merger Sub are
responsible for making their own evaluation of such projections, estimates and
budgets and shall have no claim against the Company Securityholders with
respect thereto.

 



 

(xiv) Mitigation. Parent and the other Indemnified Persons will exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Damages.

 



 

(f) Control of Defense; Conditions. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section_ _5.4(c)_ , which will apply to all Tax Contests, in the event that
Parent or another Indemnified Person becomes aware of a third party claim (any
such claim, a " _Third Party Claim_ ") that Parent believes may result in a
claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Section_ ___8_ by or on behalf of
an Indemnified Person, Parent will promptly notify the Securityholders'
Representative of such Third Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
delay in providing such notice prior to the applicable Representation
Termination Date will affect an Indemnified Person's rights hereunder, unless
(and then only to the extent that) the Company Securityholders are materially
prejudiced thereby. Such notice must contain a reasonably detailed description
of the basis of the claim and the nature and amount, if then reasonably
ascertainable, of such Damages that may be indemnifiable. The obligations of
the Company Securityholders under this _Section_ _8_ with respect to Damages
arising from any Third Party Claim will be governed by the following
additional terms and conditions:

 



 

(i) The Securityholders' Representative, at its option and at the expense
of the Company Securityholders, will be entitled to assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim at any time within 30 days of receiving
written notice of the Third Party Claim from Parent and may appoint as lead
counsel of such defense any legal counsel selected by the Securityholders'
Representative and reasonably acceptable to Parent; provided that the
Securityholders' Representative will not be entitled to assume control of the
defense of any Third Party Claim without the Parent's express written consent
in the event (A) the named parties to any such Third Party Claim (including
any impleaded parties) include both the Company Securityholders and the
Indemnified Person and, in the opinion of counsel to the Securityholders'
Representative and the Indemnified Person, there is an actual conflict of
interest between the Securityholders' Representative and the Indemnified
Person, (B) the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that there is a
reasonable probability that such Third Party Claim seeks material non-monetary
relief, (C) the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that an adverse
determination of such claim could be materially detrimental to Indemnified
Person's business; (D) the indemnifying party has failed or is failing to
diligently prosecute or defend such claim, or (E) the claim relates to or
arises in connection with any potential criminal liability or regulatory
violation of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company. In the event
that the Securityholders' Representative assumes control of the defense of any
Third Party Claim, the Securityholders' Representative will keep Parent
informed of all material events and developments, including promptly providing
copies of any correspondence and court filings, with respect to such Third
Party Claim.

 



 

 



   



 

(ii) Notwithstanding _Section_ _8.1(f)(i)_ above, the Indemnified Person
will be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ
counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , that such employment will
be at the Indemnified Person's own expense unless (A) the Securityholders'
Representative has failed to assume (or elects not to assume) the defense and
employ counsel in accordance with _Section_ _8.1(f)(i)_ , (B) the named
parties to any such Third Party Claim (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Company Securityholders and the Indemnified Person and, in
the opinion of counsel to the Securityholders' Representative and the
Indemnified Person, there is an actual conflict of interest between the
Securityholders' Representative and the Indemnified Person, (C) the
Indemnified Person determines in good faith that there is a reasonable
probability that such Third Party Claim seeks material non-monetary relief,
(D) the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that an adverse
determination of such claim could be materially detrimental to Indemnified
Person's business; (E) the indemnifying party has failed or is failing to
diligently prosecute or defend such claim, or (F) the claim relates to or
arises in connection with any potential criminal liability or regulatory
violation of Parent, Surviving Corporation, or the Company, but, in any event,
the indemnifying party shall remain subject to their indemnification
obligations set forth in this _Section_ _8_ , in which case the Indemnified
Person will have the right, by notice to the Securityholders' Representative,
to assume the defense of such claim and the reasonable fees and expenses of
the Indemnified Person's counsel incurred in connection with such Third Party
Claim will be included in Damages in the event that it is ultimately
determined pursuant to the procedures hereunder that the Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this _Section 8_ with respect to such
Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that if it is ultimately
determined by agreement of the Securityholders' Representative and the
Indemnified Person or by a court of competent jurisdiction that the
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified hereunder with respect to
the Third Party Claim, such fees and expenses will not be Damages.

 



 

(iii) In connection with a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Person
claiming indemnification shall reasonably cooperate with the indemnifying
party and make available to the indemnifying party all pertinent information
under its control (provided that all Confidential Information shall be subject
to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement). Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent will, and will cause employees of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate fully with the
Securityholders' Representative in connection with any matter for which
Securityholders are the indemnifying party. Such cooperation may include,
without limitation, (a) assisting in the collection and preparation of
discovery materials, (b) meeting with (and making employees available to meet
with) the Securityholders' Representative and/or its counsel to prepare for
and/or appear as witnesses at depositions, court proceedings and/or trial and
(c) providing to the Securityholders' Representative and/or its counsel all
information under the control of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that
is deemed necessary by the Securityholders' Representative and/or its counsel
for the defense or prosecution of such matter (subject to the attorney-client
privilege). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, in no
event will the Indemnified Person be required to waive any attorney-client
privilege in connection with such cooperation. All costs incurred by the
Indemnified Person and reasonable fees and expenses of the Indemnified
Person's counsel incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the
cooperation required under this _Section_ _8.1(f)(iii)_ will be included in
Damages in the event that it is ultimately determined pursuant to the
procedures hereunder that the Indemnified Person is entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Section 8_ with respect to such Third Party
Claim _provided_ , _however_ , that if it is ultimately determined by
agreement of the Securityholders' Representative and the Indemnified Person or
by a court of competent jurisdiction that the Indemnified Person is not
entitled to be indemnified hereunder with respect to the Third Party Claim,
such costs, fees and expenses will not be Damages.

 



 

 



   



 

(iv) Neither the Securityholders' Representative nor the Indemnified
Person may consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
or compromise with respect to any Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed (it being understood and agreed that it shall be
reasonable for the Securityholders' Representative to withhold such consent if
the Securityholders' Representative believes in good faith that there is not
any underlying basis for indemnification with respect to such settlement or
compromise).

 



 

(g) Insurance. The amount of any Damages payable under this _Section_
___8_ will be net of amounts actually received by the Indemnified Person under
its applicable insurance policies issued by insurance companies with respect
to such Damages (determined after giving effect to any deductible associated
therewith, any increase in premiums (including retro premium obligations)
resulting therefrom and net of Taxes or other liabilities incurred by such
Indemnified Person and/or any of its Affiliates as a result of such claim and
out-of-pocket costs of collecting such insurance proceeds) or third party
indemnification or contribution payments. If an Indemnified Person receives
any amounts under applicable insurance policies issued by insurance companies
or third party indemnification or contribution payments subsequent to its
receipt of an indemnification payment by the indemnifying parties, then such
Indemnified Person will, without duplication, promptly reimburse the
indemnifying parties (net of costs and expenses of such recovery and resulting
premium increases) for any payment made by such indemnifying parties up to the
amount received by the Indemnified Person; _provided_ , that the aggregate
amount of reimbursement payments to the indemnifying parties in respect of any
such Damages will not in any event exceed the aggregate indemnification
payment received by the Indemnified Person from the indemnifying parties with
respect to such Damages. Nothing in this _Section _ _8.1(g)_ will be
construed to require any Person to obtain or maintain any insurance coverage
(provided that Parent will not cancel any prepaid insurance coverage obtained
by the Company prior to the Closing or exclude the Company from any group or
umbrella insurance policies of Parent that cover subsidiaries of Parent
similarly situated to the Company).

 



 

 



   



 

(h) No Duplication of Recovery. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, (i) to the extent that any Damages resulting from
any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Company under this Agreement are taken into account as a current liability,
reserved or accrued, or otherwise accounted for, in determining Closing Date
Net Working Capital, or on the Company Balance Sheet, or otherwise taken into
account in the calculation of the Aggregate Merger Consideration, (A) no
Indemnified Person may recover such Damages through a claim pursuant to
_Section_ _8_ or otherwise and (B) such Damages will not be included in the
determination of whether all Damages, in the aggregate, exceed the Deductible
or the Cap and (ii) no Indemnified Person may recover duplicative Damages in
respect of a single set of facts or circumstances under more than one
representation or warranty in this Agreement, any Letter of Transmittal,
Option Termination Agreement, and/or Warrant Termination Agreement, regardless
of whether such facts or circumstances would give rise to a breach of more
than one representation or warranty in this Agreement, any Letter of
Transmittal, any Option Termination Agreement, and/or any Warrant Termination
Agreement.

 



 

8.2 Exercise of Remedies by Indemnified Persons other than Parent. No
Indemnified Person (other than Parent) will be permitted to assert any
indemnification claim or exercise any other remedy under this Agreement unless
Parent consents to the assertion of such indemnification claim or the exercise
of such other remedy.

 



 

8.3 Treatment of Indemnification Payments. The parties agree that any
amount paid to an Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section_ _8_ will be
treated as a reduction in the consideration payable hereunder for Tax
purposes.

9.3 Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest. This
Agreement and the documents and instruments delivered pursuant hereto,
including the exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the other
schedules hereto: (a) together constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior

Agreement, which will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms and will survive any termination of this Agreement until the Closing;
(b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies
hereunder (other than the DandO Indemnified Parties, who are intended third-
party beneficiaries of _Section 5.5_); and (c) may not be assigned by Parent,
on the one hand, or by Company or the Securityholders' Representative, on the
other hand (by operation of law or otherwise), without the written consent of
each of the parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent, Merger Sub
or the Surviving Corporation may, without the consent of any other party, (i)
assign this Agreement to any Affiliate or to a third party in connection with
the sale of all or substantially all of the business to which this Agreement
relates, and (ii) collaterally assign their rights under this Agreement to
their lenders or the lenders of any of their Affiliates. This Agreement will
be binding upon, and will inure to the benefit of, each party and its
successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

9.4 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or
the application thereof becomes, or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement, and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be illegal,
void or unenforceable, will not be impaired or otherwise affected and will
continue in full force and effect and be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

 



 

9.5 Expenses. Other than as set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree
that all fees and expenses incurred by them in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby will be borne by the party incurring
such fees and expenses, including all fees of counsel and accountants.

 



 

9.6 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in
the event that any provision of this Agreement was not performed in accordance
with the specific terms hereof or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties hereto will be entitled (in addition to any other
remedies available to them) to the remedies of specific performance (which
will include the right to obtain an order compelling a party's counterparty
hereto to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and
injunctive relief (without bond or other security being required and without
the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages) to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity. For clarity, following the
Closing, _Section 8.1(e)(i)_ will control exclusively regarding remedies.

 



 

 



   



 

9.7 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.

otherwise, will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of Delaware (including in respect of the statute of limitations or
other limitations period applicable to any such claim, controversy or

might require the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Any judicial proceeding brought with respect to this Agreement must be
brought in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the
State of Delaware, and, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, each
party (i) accepts and consents to, generally and unconditionally, the

agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby in connection with this
Agreement, and (ii) irrevocably waives any objection it may now or hereafter
have as to the venue of any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such a
court or that such court is an inconvenient forum.

party's address set forth herein will be effective service of process for any
suit, action or other proceeding relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Representative irrevocably and unconditionally waives the right to trial by
jury in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

9.8 Rules of Construction.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel

to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any specific section of this

9.10 Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed by Parent, the Company and the Securityholders'
Representative. Any waiver of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement
must be in writing and must be duly executed by or on behalf of the party to
be charged with such waiver. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement,
the failure of a party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist
upon strict adherence to any term or condition hereof on any one occasion will
not be construed as a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to
insist upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at
a later date. Further, no waiver of any of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement will be deemed to or will constitute a waiver of any other term of
condition hereof (whether or not similar).

 



 

9.11 Headings. The article and section headings contained in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only, will not be deemed to be a
part of this Agreement and will not be referred to in connection with the
construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

9.12 Consent to Representation; Conflict of Interest. If the
Securityholders' Representative so desires, acting on behalf of the Company
Securityholders and without the need for any consent or waiver by Company,
Parent, or Sub, Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin and Hachigian LLP
(" _Gunderson_ ") or Choate Hall and Stewart LLP (" _Choate_ ") shall be
permitted to represent the Company Securityholders after the Closing in
connection with any matter, including anything related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any other agreements referenced herein or any
disagreement or dispute relating thereto. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, after the Closing, Gunderson or Choate shall be permitted to
represent the Company Securityholders, any of their agents and Affiliates, or
any one or more of them, in connection with any negotiation, transaction, or
dispute (including any litigation, arbitration, or other adversary proceeding)
with Parent, the Company, or any of their agents or Affiliates under or
relating to this Agreement, any transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
and any related matter, such as claims or disputes arising under other
agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement, including with
respect to any indemnification claims. Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company
further agree that, as to all communications among Gunderson, Choate and the
Securityholders' Representative and the Company Securityholders and their
respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ")
that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
attorney-client privilege and the exception of client confidence belongs
solely to the Seller Group and may be controlled only by the Seller Group and
shall not pass to or be claimed by Parent, Sub, and Company, because the
interests of Parent and its Affiliates were directly adverse to the Company,
the Company Securityholders, and the Securityholders' Representative at the
time such communications were made. This right to the attorney-client
privilege shall exist even if such communications may exist on the Company's
computer system or in documents in the Company's possession. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Parent, Merger Sub,
and the Company, on the one hand, and a Person other than a party to this
Agreement, on the other hand, after the Closing, the Company may assert the
attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure to such third-party of
confidential communications by Gunderson or Choate to the Company; provided,
however, that the Company may not waive such privilege without the prior
written consent of the Securityholders' Representative.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and the Securityholders'
Representative have caused this Agreement to be executed and delivered by each
of them or their respective officers, all as of the date first written above.
