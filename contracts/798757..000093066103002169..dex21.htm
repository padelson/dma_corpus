the best interests of their respective corporations and stockholders, and (ii)
approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the

intending to be legally bound hereby, the Company, Parent and Acquisition

ARTICLE 1



THE MERGER



Section 1.1. _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Acquisition shall be merged
with and into the Company (the "Merger"). Following the Merger, the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"),
and the separate corporate existence of Acquisition shall  



 

1  cease. At the election of Parent, Parent, or a Delaware limited liability
company wholly owned by Parent ("Acquisition LLC"), may be substituted herein
for Acquisition, and the Merger may be restructured so that the Company shall
be merged with and into Parent or Acquisition LLC, with the result that Parent
or Acquisition LLC shall become the "Surviving Company"; _provided, however,_
that such substitution will not prevent the closing conditions in Section
5.2(d) and 5.3(d) from being satisfied. If Parent elects to effect such
substitution of Parent or Acquisition LLC for Acquisition and the foregoing
conditions for such substitution are satisfied, the parties shall amend this
Agreement, prior to Closing and effective prior to the Effective Time, as
reasonably necessary to effect such substitution; _provided further,_ that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall
Parent be entitled to terminate this Agreement because of the direct or
indirect effect of such election by Parent, and no condition set forth
in Section 5.1 or Section 5.3, which shall have otherwise been satisfied,
shall be considered not satisfied because of the direct or indirect effect of
such election, including as a result of the necessity of obtaining additional
consents or approvals. Parent, as the sole stockholder of Acquisition, hereby
approves the Merger and this Agreement.



Section 1.2. _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date, a Certificate of
Merger substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ (the "Certificate of Merger")
shall be duly executed and acknowledged by the Company and thereafter
delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware for filing
pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at
such time as a properly executed copy of the Certificate of Merger is duly
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with
Section 251 of the DGCL or such later time as Parent and the Company may
agree upon and as set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").



Section 1.3. _Closing of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at a time and on a date (the "Closing Date") to be
specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the second business
day after satisfaction (or waiver) of the latest to occur of the conditions
set forth in Article 5 except for such conditions which may only be satisfied
by delivery of documents or certificates at the Closing, at the offices of
Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, One Montgomery Street, San Francisco, California
94104, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto.



Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the
effects set forth in the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company and Acquisition shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of
the Surviving Corporation.



Section 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to
read the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition in effect at
the Effective Time, and shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with Applicable Law;
_provided, however_ , that at the Effective Time, Article I of the Certificate
of  



 

2  Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to read as following: "The name of this corporation is J.D.
Edwards and Company." The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
as necessary to read the same as the bylaws of Acquisition in effect at the
Effective Time until amended in accordance with Applicable Law. 



Section 1.6. _Directors_. The directors of Acquisition at the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until such directors successor is duly
elected or appointed and qualified.



Section 1.7. _Officers_. The officers of Acquisition at the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until such officers successor is duly elected or
appointed and qualified. 



Section 1.8. _Conversion of Shares_.



(a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Company (each a "Share" and, collectively, the "Shares") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
Shares held in the Companys treasury and (ii) Shares held by Parent or
Acquisition) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and
shall become a number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") equal the
Exchange Ratio (the "Merger Consideration"). Unless the context otherwise
requires, each reference in this Agreement to shares of Parent Common Stock
and to the Shares shall include the associated Parent Rights and associated
Company Rights, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of
Parent Common Stock or the Shares shall have been changed into a different
number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
exchange of shares, then the Exchange Ratio shall be correspondingly adjusted
to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.



(b) The "Exchange Ratio" shall be 0.860.



(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding share of the common stock,
$0.001 par value per share, of Acquisition shall be converted into one share
of common stock, $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



(d) At the Effective Time, each Share held in the treasury of the Company
and each Share held by Parent or Acquisition immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Acquisition, the Company or the holder thereof, be canceled, retired
and cease to exist, and no shares of Parent Common Stock shall be delivered
with respect thereto.



(e) Each Share subject to repurchase by the Company, or that is otherwise
subject to a risk of forfeiture or other condition under any applicable
restricted stock purchase  



 

3  agreement or other agreement with the Company, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each a "Restricted Company Share")
shall be exchanged pursuant to Section 1.8(a) into Parent Common Stock,
subject to repurchase by Parent on the same terms as governed such Restricted
Company Shares prior to the Merger ("Restricted Parent Shares"); _provided,
however,_ that the repurchase price for each Restricted Parent Share issued
with respect to a Restricted Company Share shall equal the repurchase price
for the Restricted Company Share divided by the Exchange Ratio. Certificates
representing the Restricted Parent Shares shall be held by Parent until such
shares are no longer subject to repurchase. Cash dividends on Restricted
Parent Shares will be distributed to the holder of such Restricted
Parent Shares on whose behalf the Restricted Parent Shares are being held by
Parent. Any shares of Parent Common Stock or other equity securities issued or
distributed by Parent, including shares issued upon a stock dividend or split,
in respect of Restricted Parent Shares (which remain restricted at the time
of such distribution) will be subject to the same restrictions and other terms
as the Restricted Parent Share with respect to which the distribution is made.
Each holder of Restricted Parent Shares will have voting rights with respect
to Restricted Parent Shares (and other voting securities) held by Parent on
its behalf.



Section 1.9. _Exchange of Certificates_.



(a) Promptly following the Effective Time, as required by subsections (b)
and (c) below, Parent shall deliver to its transfer agent, or a depository or
trust institution of recognized standing selected by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent") for the benefit of the
holders of Shares for exchange in accordance with this Article 1: (i)
certificates representing the appropriate number of shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8 and (ii) cash to be paid in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock (such shares of Parent Common Stock
and such cash are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"), in exchange
for outstanding Shares.



(b) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange
Agent, promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5)
business days following the Effective Time), to mail to each holder of record
of a certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding Shares (the "Certificates") and whose Shares were
converted into the right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
Section 1.8: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other customary provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares
of Parent Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and, if applicable, a check representing the cash
consideration to which such holder may be entitled on account of a fractional
share of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 1, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent
Common Stock  



 

4  may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Shares is
presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 1.9, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by this Section 1.9.



(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall
be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 1.9(f), until the holder of
record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to the
effect of Applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate there
shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor without interest (i)
the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 1.9(f) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender payable with
respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.



(d) If any Certificate for Shares shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange therefor upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof such shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, as may be required
pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent or the
Exchange Agent may, in its discretion, require the delivery of a bond or
indemnity reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Exchange Agent.



(e) All shares of Parent Common Stock issued upon the surrender for
exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash
paid pursuant to Section 1.9(c) or 1.9(f)) shall be deemed to have been
issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Shares and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are
presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled
and exchanged as provided in this Article 1.



(f) No fractions of a share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the
Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares otherwise entitled to a
fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall upon surrender of his or her
Certificate or Certificates be entitled to receive an amount of cash (without
interest) determined by multiplying the average closing sale prices for one
share of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market for the
five (5) trading days prior to the Effective Time by the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (after aggregating
all shares owned by such  



 

5  holder). The parties acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration in
lieu of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained
for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for
purposes of simplifying the corporate and accounting complexities that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares.



(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
stockholders of the Company upon the expiration of twelve (12) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand, and any
stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Article 1 shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim for
Parent Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares, as the case may be,
and any applicable dividends or distributions with respect to Parent Common
Stock. 



(h) Neither Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Shares
for shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable
Law.



Section 1.10. _Stock Options_ _._



(a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option, warrant or other right
to purchase Shares (a "Company Stock Option" or collectively, "Company Stock
Options") issued pursuant to the Companys 1992 Incentive Stock Option Plan,
1992 Nonqualified Stock Option Plan, 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, 1997
Equity Incentive Plan, 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-United States
Employees, 2003 J.D. Edwards and Company Equity Incentive Plan, YOUcentric 2000
Equity Compensation Plan or other agreement or arrangement, whether vested or
unvested, shall be converted as of the Effective Time into an option, warrant
or right, as applicable, to purchase shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with this Section 1.10. All plans or agreements described above
pursuant to which any Company Stock Option has been issued or may be issued
other than outstanding warrants or rights are referred to collectively as the
"Company Plans." At the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option so converted
shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to such Company Stock Option as set forth in
the applicable Company Plan and the agreement(s) evidencing the grant thereof
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including provisions with respect to
vesting, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder of such Company Stock Option
would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder
exercised such Company Stock Option in full immediately prior to the Effective
Time at a price per share equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for the
Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by
(y) the product of (i) the number of Shares otherwise purchasable pursuant to
such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio; _provided_
, _however_ , that in the case of any option to which Section 421 of the Code
applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 through Section 424
of the Code ("incentive stock options" or "ISOs") the option price, the
number of shares purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and
conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined so as to comply with
Section 424(a)  



 

6  of the Code and it is the intention of the parties that such options will
qualify as incentive stock options following the Effective Time. 



(b) As soon as practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) days)
after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the holders of Company Stock
Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders rights pursuant to the
applicable Company Plan and that the agreements evidencing the grants of such
options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to
the adjustments required by this Section 1.10 after giving effect to the
Merger).



(c) At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall take all corporate
action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of
Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Company Stock Options
assumed in accordance with this Section 1.10. Within ten (10) business days
after the Effective Time, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to any Company Stock Options held by all
persons with respect to whom registration on Form S-8 is available and shall
use all commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as
such options remain outstanding.



(d) At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall cause to be effected
any necessary amendments to the Company Plans to give effect to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 1.10.



Section 1.11. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any person pursuant to this Article 1 such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.



ARTICLE 2



REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



The Company hereby represents and warrants to each of Parent and Acquisition,
subject to the exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Schedule (the "Company
Disclosure Schedule") delivered by the Company simultaneously with the
execution hereof (which Company Disclosure Schedule shall specifically
identify the specific Section or subsection, as applicable, to which each such
exception relates), that:



 

7 Section 2.1. _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries; Investments_.



(a) Section 2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list of each person in which the Company owns, directly or
indirectly, 50% or more of the voting interests or of which the Company
otherwise has the right to direct the management (each, a "Subsidiary")
together with the jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each
Subsidiary and the percentage of each Subsidiarys outstanding capital stock
or other equity interests owned directly or indirectly by the Company. All of
the outstanding capital stock or other ownership interests of each Subsidiary
is owned by the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien
or any other limitation or restriction. Each of the Company and Subsidiaries
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all requisite power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted except where any failure of any Subsidiary to
be so organized, existing and in good standing could be cured by a
ministerial filing or payment of a fee or tax. The Company has made available
to Parent and Acquisition accurate and complete copies of the Certificate of
Incorporation and bylaws or comparable other governing documents, each as in
full force and effect on the date hereof, of the Company and each of its
Significant Subsidiaries (as such term is defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation
S-X of the SEC). Other than as specified in Section 2.1(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, the Company has no operating Subsidiaries other than
those incorporated in a state of the United States.



(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the property
owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by it
makes such qualification or licensing necessary except in such jurisdictions
where the failure to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company.



(c) Section 2.1(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
complete list, as of the date hereof, of each equity investment (including
obligations that are convertible into equity securities) made by the Company
or any Subsidiary in any person (including the percentage ownership as of the
most recent practicable date for which the Company or such Subsidiary has
capitalization information for such entity and any management rights
granted to the Company or any such Subsidiary) other than the Subsidiaries
("Other Interests"). The Other Interests are owned directly or indirectly by
the Company free and clear of all Liens.



Section 2.2. _Capitalization of the Company and its Subsidiaries_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of (i) Three
Hundred Million (300,000,000) Shares, of which, as of May 28, 2003, One
Hundred Twenty-Two Million Four Hundred Twenty-Six Thousand Six Hundred
Sixty-Four (122,426,664) Shares were issued and outstanding; and (ii) Five
Million (5,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share
("Company Preferred Stock"), none of which are outstanding as of the
date hereof. All of the outstanding Shares have been validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. As of May 28, 2003,
an aggregate  



 

8  of Thirty-One Million Nine Hundred Sixty-Six Thousand Two Hundred Sixty-Nine
(31,966,269) Shares were reserved for issuance of which Twenty-Two Million
Forty-Five Thousand Three Hundred and One (22,045,301) Shares were issuable
upon or otherwise deliverable in connection with the exercise of outstanding
Company Stock Options issued pursuant to the Company Plans. Between May
28, 2003 and the date hereof, no shares of the Companys capital stock have
been issued other than pursuant to the exercise of Company Stock Options
already in existence on such first date, and between May 28, 2003 and the date
hereof, no stock options have been granted. Except as set forth above and for
the stockholder rights ("Company Rights") issued pursuant to that certain
Preferred Stock Rights Agreement, dated as of October 22, 2001, as amended,
between the Company and Computershare Trust Company, Inc., as Rights Agent
(the "Company Rights Agreement"), as of the date hereof, there are outstanding
(i) no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company, (ii)
no securities of the Company or any Subsidiary convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, shares of capital stock or other voting
securities of the Company or any Subsidiary, (iii) no options, warrants or
other rights to acquire from the Company or any Subsidiary, and no
obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to issue any capital stock,
voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for capital stock or other voting securities of the Company or
any Subsidiary, and (iv) no equity equivalent interests in the ownership or
earnings of the Company or any Subsidiary or other similar rights. All of the
outstanding Shares and Company Stock Options (collectively "Company
Securities") were issued in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), and applicable state securities laws. As of
the date hereof, except with respect to the Restricted Company Shares, there
are no outstanding rights or obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of its capital
stock or other ownership interests. Other than the Company Voting Agreements,
there are no stockholder agreements, voting trusts or other arrangements or
understandings to which the Company, the Company Board or any Subsidiary is a
party, and to the Companys knowledge, there are no other agreements, voting
trusts or other arrangements or understandings, relating to the voting or
registration of any shares of capital stock or other voting securities of the
Company or any Subsidiary. Other than treasury stock as described in the
Financial Statements, no Shares, Company Preferred Stock or Company Stock
Options are owned by the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company has provided
to Parent a true and complete list of all holders of outstanding Restricted
Company Shares or Company Stock Options, the exercise or vesting schedule,
the exercise price per share, and the term of each Restricted Company Share or
Company Stock Option, as applicable and in the case of Company Stock Options,
whether such option is a nonqualified stock option or incentive stock option,
and any restrictions on the Companys right to repurchase of the Shares
underlying the options, and whether or not, to the Companys knowledge, an
election under Section 83(b) of the Code is in effect with respect to such
Shares that are Restricted Company Shares, in each case as of the date
hereof. None of the terms of the Company Stock Options or Restricted Company
Shares provides for accelerated vesting as a result of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Other than as disclosed in the Companys SEC Reports
filed on or before the date hereof, since the Companys initial public
offering, the Company has not granted Company Stock Options to employees or
consultants under any Company Plan at an



 

9  exercise price of less than the fair market value per Share at the time of
grant as determined in good faith by the Company Board. 



(b) The Company Rights and the Shares constitute the only classes of
equity securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries registered or required to
be registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act").



Section 2.3. _Authority Relative to this Agreement; Recommendation_.



(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations under this Agreement
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, have been duly and validly authorized by the Board of
Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"). The Company Board
has directed that this Agreement be submitted to the Companys stockholders
for approval at the meeting of the Companys stockholders to be held in
connection with the Merger (the "Company Stockholders Meeting"), and
except for the approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement by
the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares
(the "Company Stockholder Approval"), no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly
and validly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Acquisition, constitutes
the valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in
effect relating to creditors rights generally or to general principles of
equity.



(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company Board has
unanimously (i) determined that the Merger is advisable and fair to, and in
the best interests of the Company and the Companys stockholders and (ii)
approved this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) resolved to recommend approval and adoption of this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby by the Companys
stockholders, and (iv) has not withdrawn or modified such approval or
resolution to recommend (except as otherwise permitted in this Agreement).



Section 2.4. _SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Compliance_.



(a) The Company has filed all required forms, reports and documents
("Company SEC Reports") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") since October 31, 1999, each of which complied at the time of filing in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, each law as in effect on the dates such forms, reports
and documents were filed. None of such Company SEC Reports, including any
financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference
therein, contained when filed any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by
reference therein or necessary in  



 

10  order to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances under
which they were made not misleading, except to the extent superseded or
amended by a Company SEC Report filed subsequently and prior to the date
hereof. The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Reports (the "Financial Statements") fairly presented in
all material respects, in conformity with United States generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto and except that unaudited statements do not
contain footnotes in substance or form required to the extent permitted by
Form 10-Q of the Exchange Act), the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended,
except that the unaudited interim financial statements of the Company
contained in the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
January 31, 2003 were subject to normal adjustments that are not expected to
be material in amount.



(b) The Company has heretofore made, and hereafter will make, available to
Acquisition or Parent a complete and correct copy of any amendments or
modifications that are required to be filed with or submitted to the SEC but
have not yet been filed with or submitted to the SEC to agreements, documents
or other instruments that previously had been filed with or submitted to the
SEC by the Company pursuant to the Exchange Act.



(c) Each required form, report and document containing financial
statements that has been filed with or submitted to the SEC since July 31,

condition or circumstance has existed that could result in a material increase
in the benefits under such Company Employee Plan maintained by Company or any

or agreement affecting any Company Employee Plan requires or permits a
retroactive increase in premiums or payments due thereunder (other than any

of the date hereof.



(i) _Effect of Transaction_.



(i) The execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the

any material payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise), acceleration,
forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution, increase in benefits or
obligation to fund benefits with respect to any officer or employee of the
Company.



 

18 (ii) No payment or benefit which will or may be made by the Company or

laws, regulations, or jurisdiction outside the United States is in material
compliance with the requirements of such laws.

as that term is defined in Section 414(n) of the Code, or any other person who
is not classified as a common law employee of the Company is eligible to
participate in, nor does such person participate in, any Company Employee
Plan, and, to the Companys knowledge, no retroactive participation in any
Company Employee Plan would result due to reclassification of such an
individual as a common law employee of the Company or an ERISA Affiliate. The
exclusion of any such individual from any Company Employee Plan would not
reasonably be expected to cause any Company Employee Plan which is intended to
be qualified under Code Section 401(a) to lose such qualification, nor, to
the Companys knowledge, does the exclusion of any such individual violate the
terms of any Company Employee Plan.

National Labor Relations Board seeking recognition of a bargaining
representative, and no such petition or proceeding is pending or, to the
Companys knowledge, threatened.

the Companys knowledge, threatened or (B) to the Companys knowledge,

eight (48) months any written demand letters, civil rights charges, suits or
drafts of suits, administrative or other claims made by any of its employees
which are or could be material.



(c) All individuals who are performing consulting or other services for the
Company or any Subsidiary are or were correctly classified by the Company as

result in material harm to the Company.

the name of each officer, employee and independent contractor of the Company
and each Subsidiary, together with such persons position or function, annual
base salary or wages and any incentives or bonus arrangement with respect to
such person. The Company has provided to Parent or its counsel all Form 1099s
filed with the IRS for the past three (3) years. As of the date hereof, the
Company has not received any information that would lead it to believe that
any such person will or may cease to be engaged by the Company or applicable
Subsidiary for any reason, including because of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(e) The Company and each Subsidiary (and, to the Companys knowledge, each

compensation benefits, social security or other benefits or obligations for
Employees (other than routine payments to be made in the normal course of
business and consistent with past practices).



(i) To the Companys knowledge, the Company has not been threatened with
any claim for discrimination or harassment, including sexual harassment.



(j) Section 2.12(j) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a
complete and correct list of all employees holding visas issued by the United
States, listing each such employee by name and type of visa. All other
employees of the Company and each Subsidiary working in the United States and
subject to United States immigration laws are citizens of the United States.
To the Companys knowledge, each employee of the Company and each Subsidiary
(whether employed within or outside of the United States) possesses all
applicable passports, visas or other applicable work authorizations with
respect to the location at which they are employed or with respect to which
they travel on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary, and has complied with
all applicable immigration and similar laws.



(k) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is bound by any agreement, nor
has either taken or omitted to take any action, that restricts its ability to
terminate the employment of any of its employees at any time without payment
or other liability.

description of all policies and guidelines of the Company and each Subsidiary

Environmental Law or which could reasonably be expected to prevent the Company
or any Subsidiary from complying with Environmental Laws; and (vii) other than
non-compliance or violations that individually or in the aggregate could not
reasonably

material compliance with all approvals, authorizations, certificates,

company within  



 

23  the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code, and neither the Company nor any

Section 2.15. _Intellectual Property_ _._



(a) Section 2.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately
identifies all Company Registered IP and all unregistered trademarks
currently used by the Company or any Subsidiary, which unregistered trademarks
are used on or in relation to a product or service of Company which accounts
individually for more than $500,000 of revenue annually, indicating for each
item thereof the beneficial owner thereof and, if different, the record owner
thereof, the applicable registration, issuance or other identifying number,
the date of registration, issuance or filing, as applicable. In the case of
any Company Registered IP in which a person other than the Company or any
Subsidiary holds an ownership interest, Section 2.15(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule identifies such person and accurately describes the extent
of such interest. No person has an ownership interest in any copyright of the
Company that would entitle them to exploit the copyright without the Companys
consent.



(b) "Shrinkwrap Software" means "off-the-shelf" computer software
applications, other than Company Owned IP, that are generally available to
all interested purchasers and licensees on standard terms and conditions.
Section 2.15(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule accurately (i) identifies
all Company Licensed IP (A) that is incorporated in Companys products
provided to customers or provided to customers in connection with products or
services of the Company; (B) is "resold" or sublicensed to customers by the
Company; (C) that is used by the Company as a development tool, excluding
Shrinkwrap Software, or (D) is material to the Companys business and is not
covered under (A), (B) or (C), and is not Shrinkwrap Software; (ii) identifies
the license or other agreement or understanding pursuant to which such
Company Licensed IP is being licensed to or used by the Company or any
Subsidiary (each, a "License-In Agreement"); and (iii) sets forth a complete
and accurate list of the amount of any remaining unused prepaid royalty and
identifies those License-In Agreements under which royalty or license fee
(excluding fees for maintenance and support), may become payable by the
Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable, thereunder by reason of the passage
of time, use or exploitation of the Intellectual Property licensed
thereunder. The rights licensed under each License-In Agreement shall be
exercisable by the Surviving Corporation on and after the Closing to the same
extent and at the same cost as the Company or such Subsidiary, as applicable,
prior to the Closing and no  



 

24  party granting such rights has given formal written notice to the Company
or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened that it intends to terminate such
License-In Agreement prior to the expiration thereof in accordance with its
terms.



(c) The Company or one of its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to all
of the Company Owned IP, including without limitation all Company Registered
IP identified in Section 2.15(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, free and
clear of any Liens, and, to the Companys knowledge, (i) the Company
Registered IP is valid and (ii) the Company has the right to enforce the
Company Owned IP against third parties. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
is obligated to make any payment to any person in connection with the
manufacture, use, sale, importation, distribution, display, modification
or other exploitation of any Company Owned IP or any of the Companys
products. The Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, is free to make, use,
modify, copy, distribute, sell, license, import, export and otherwise exploit
all Company Owned IP on an exclusive basis subject to any nonexclusive (w)
end-user licenses granted to customers; (x) distribution rights granted to
resellers or distributors in the ordinary course of business; (y)
nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements pursuant to which any person has
been granted access to Company Owned IP but not the right to exploit such
Company Owned IP; or (z) partner agreements based on the Companys standard
form of partner agreement. No current or former employee, officer, director,
stockholder, consultant or independent contractor has any valid right, claim
or interest in or with respect to any Company IP which would impair or which
could give rise to the impairment of the Companys use, distribution, license
or other exploitation of the Company IP.



(d) The Company and each Subsidiary have taken reasonable measures and
precautions necessary to protect, preserve and maintain the confidentiality
and secrecy of all trade secrets and other confidential information material
to the Companys business and otherwise to maintain and protect the value of
all Company Owned IP. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has disclosed or
delivered or permitted to be disclosed or delivered to any person, and no
person (other than employees or consultants of the Company and its
Subsidiaries which need such information in the course of their employment)
has access to or has any rights with respect to, trade secrets and other
confidential information material to the Companys business, the source code
or any portion or aspect of the source code material to the Companys
business, or any proprietary information or algorithm contained in any source
code of any software material to the Companys business that comprises
Company Owned IP, other than (i) instances where such trade secrets,
confidential information and source code has been disclosed subject to an
agreement with any person pursuant to which such person is required to
maintain the confidentiality thereof, or (ii) other circumstances in which
disclosure was made and the Company promptly acted to mitigate and prevent any
further disclosure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Company has, and since 1993 has had, a policy of requiring each employee of
the Company or any Subsidiary, and each independent contractor, who is
involved in, or who contributes to, the creation or development of any of the
Companys products or Company Owned IP to execute and deliver an agreement,
substantially similar to the forms of agreement delivered by the Company to
Parent, assigning to the Company full right, title and interest in and to what
they create or develop in the scope of their employment or assignment, as
applicable. The Company substantially complies, and during the time period
referenced above has substantially complied, with such policy. No  



 

25  event has occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that with or
without notice or lapse of time will, or could reasonably be expected to,
result in the disclosure or delivery to any person of source code, or any
portion or aspect of source code, currently maintained in escrow.



(e) (i) None of the Company Owned IP or any of the Companys products or
services or the Intellectual Property used by the Company in its operations
which is not Company Licensed IP or Shrinkwrap Software, infringe,
misappropriate, violate, dilute or constitute the unauthorized use of any
Intellectual Property of any third party and neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has received (A) any notice or claim either oral or written in the
past three (3) years asserting or suggesting that any such infringement,
misappropriation, violation, dilution or unauthorized use is or may
be occurring or has or may have occurred, or (B) any written notice or claim
since the time of the Companys initial public offering asserting or
suggesting that any such infringement, misappropriation, violation, dilution
or unauthorized use is or may be occurring or has or may have occurred that
would be material to the business and operations of the Company. No Proceeding
is pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened, nor is there any
pending claim or demand which challenges the ownership, legality, validity,
enforceability, use, exploitation or modification by the Company or any
Subsidiary of such Company Owned IP. No Company Owned IP is subject to any
outstanding order, judgment, decree, or stipulation restricting the use
thereof by the Company or any Subsidiary or, in the case of any Intellectual
Property licensed to others, restricting the sale, transfer, assignment or
licensing thereof by the Company or such Subsidiary to any person.



(ii) To the Companys knowledge, the Company Licensed IP does not
infringe, misappropriate, violate, dilute or constitute the unauthorized use
of any Intellectual Property of any third party.



(iii) The Company has the right to grant the licenses it grants in the
course of its business.



(iv) To the knowledge of the Company, the Company has the right to conduct
its business as it is currently conducted.



(f) All Company Registered IP is (i) to the Companys knowledge, valid,
enforceable to the full extent permitted by the jurisdiction in which it is
registered and in full force and effect, and (ii) all maintenance, annuity
and other fees due in respect of such Company Registered IP have been fully
paid and all filings applicable thereto have been properly made except with
respect to Company Registered IP that the Company has made a reasonable
business judgment not to pursue protection or not to maintain. No trademark
included in the Company Registered IP is now involved in any opposition or
cancellation proceeding and no trademark that is currently used by the
Company has been involved in any opposition or cancellation proceeding. No
patent or patent application included in the Company Registered IP is now
involved in any interference, reissue or reexamination proceeding.



 

26 (g) To the knowledge of the Company, no person is infringing or
misappropriating any Company Owned IP in any material respect or making any
unlawful use of any products of the Company in any material respect. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has initiated and is maintaining before a court
or in an arbitration proceeding claims or causes of action against other
persons for infringement by such persons of Company Owned IP (including claims
for past infringement of Intellectual Property). Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has, during the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof,
threatened in a writing sent by the Companys legal department or outside
counsel to initiate such proceeding.



(h) No Company Owned IP and, to the Companys knowledge, no Company
Licensed IP, incorporated into or used in conjunction with any product,
system, program or software module that is or was used in or material to (or
that relates to) the assets of the Company or any Subsidiary contains any
"back door," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "worm," "drop dead device," "virus"
or other software routines or hardware components designed to
permit unauthorized access or to disable or erase software, hardware or data
without the consent of the user.



(i) None of the software products of the Company or any Subsidiary is, in
whole or in part, subject to the provisions of any open source or other
source code license agreement that (i) requires the distribution of source
code in connection with the distribution of the licensed software in object
code form; (ii) prohibits or limits the Company or any Subsidiary from
charging a fee or receiving consideration in connection with sublicensing or
distributing such licensed software (whether in source code or object code
form); or (iii) allows a customer or requires that a customer have the right
to decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the software by its
terms and not by operation of law.



Section 2.16. _Insurance_. Each of the insurance policies maintained by
the Company and each Subsidiary (the "Insurance Policies") is in full force
and effect and is valid, outstanding and enforceable, and all premiums due
thereon have been paid in full, or if not yet due and payable, reserved by the
Company on its unaudited balance sheet as of April 30, 2003 in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles. True and complete
copies of all Insurance Policies have been delivered or made available to
Parent. None of the Insurance Policies will terminate or lapse (or be
affected in any other materially adverse manner) by reason of the execution
and delivery of, or consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by,
this Agreement. Each of the Company and each Subsidiary has complied in all
material respects with the provisions of each Insurance Policy under which it
is the insured party. No insurer under any Insurance Policy has canceled or
generally disclaimed liability under any such policy or, to the Companys
knowledge, indicated any intent to do so or not to renew any such policy. All
material claims of the Company or any Subsidiary under the Insurance Policies
have been filed in a timely fashion.



Section 2.17. _Title to Properties; Absence of Liens and Encumbrances_.



(a) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has an ownership interest in any
real property, nor has it ever had an ownership interest in any real property.
Section 2.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a complete and
accurate list of all real property  



 

27  currently leased or subleased by the Company or any Subsidiary, with the
name of the lessor and the date of the lease, sublease, assignment of the
lease, any guaranty given or leasing commissions payable by the Company or any
Subsidiary in connection therewith and each amendment to any of the foregoing
(collectively, the "Lease Documents"). True, correct and complete copies of
all Lease Documents have been delivered or made available to Parent or
Parents counsel. All such current leases and subleases are in full force and
effect, are valid and effective in accordance with their respective terms, and
there is not, under any of such leases, any existing material default or
event of default (or event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) by the Company or any Subsidiary or, to the Companys
knowledge, by the other party to such lease or sublease, or person in the
chain of title to such leased premises.



(b) Each of the Company and Subsidiaries has good and valid title to, or,
in the case of leased properties and assets, valid leasehold or subleasehold
interests in, all of its properties and assets, tangible and intangible,
real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in its business, free and clear
of any Liens, except for such imperfections of title, if any, that do not
materially interfere with the present value of the subject property. For
purposes of this Section 2.17 only, the terms "property" and "assets" do not
include Intellectual Property.



Section 2.18. _Certain Business Practices_. None of the Company, any
Subsidiary or, to the Companys knowledge, any directors or officers, agents
or employees of the Company or any Subsidiary, has (i) used any funds for
unlawful contributions, gifts, entertainment or other unlawful expenses
related to political activity; (ii) made any unlawful payment to foreign or
domestic government officials or employees or to foreign or domestic political
parties or campaigns or violated any provision of the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, as amended; or (iii) made any payment in the nature of
criminal bribery.



Section 2.19. _Product Warranties_. Section 2.19 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule sets forth complete and accurate copies of the forms of
written warranties and guaranties by the Company or any Subsidiary utilized
with respect to its products or services. There have not been any material
deviations from such warranties and guaranties that would obligate the Company
or any Subsidiary to provide products or services in any form or manner not
consistent with the relevant specifications for such products or services,
and none of the Company, any Subsidiary or any of their respective
salespeople, employees, distributors and agents is authorized to undertake
obligations to any customer or to other third parties in excess of such
warranties or guaranties.

Section 3.3. _Authority Relative to this Agreement_.



(a) Each of Parent and Acquisition has all necessary corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
boards of directors of Parent and Acquisition and by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Acquisition. The Board of Directors of Parent (the "Parent
Board") has directed that the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement be submitted to Parents stockholders for approval at the
meeting of Parents stockholders to be held in connection with the Merger (the
"Parent Stockholders Meeting") and, except for the approval of the issuance

stockholders at which a quorum is present (the "Parent Stockholder Approval"),
no other corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Acquisition are
necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Acquisition and assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the Company, constitutes
a valid, legal and binding agreement of each of Parent and Acquisition
enforceable against each of Parent and Acquisition in accordance with its
terms, subject to any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors
rights generally or to general principles of equity.

shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of Company Stock
Options assumed by Parent pursuant hereto. 



Section 3.5. _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.



(a) Parent has filed all required forms, reports and documents ("Parent SEC
Reports") with the SEC since December 31, 1999, each of which complied at the
time of filing in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, each law as in effect on the dates
such forms, reports and documents were filed. None of such Parent SEC Reports,
including any financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by
reference therein, contained when filed any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated
by reference therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein
in light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading,
except to the extent superseded or amended by a Parent SEC Report filed
subsequently and prior to the date hereof. The consolidated financial
statements of Parent included in the Parent SEC Reports fairly present in
conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a consistent basis (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated subsidiaries
as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of operations and cash
flows for the periods then ended.



(b) Parent has heretofore made, and hereafter will make, available to the
Company a complete and correct copy of any amendments or modifications that
are required to be filed with or submitted to the SEC but have not yet been
filed with or submitted to the SEC to agreements, documents or other
instruments that previously had been filed with or submitted to the SEC by
Parent pursuant to the Exchange Act.



(c) Each required form, report and document containing financial statements
that has been filed with or submitted to the SEC since July 31, 2002, was
accompanied by the certifications required to be filed or submitted by
Parents chief executive officer and chief financial officer pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and at the time of filing or submission of each such
certification, such certification was true and accurate and complied with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.



(d) Since December 31, 1999, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries
nor, to Parents knowledge, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or representative of Parent or any of its subsidiaries has
received or otherwise had or obtained knowledge of any complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the accounting or
auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of Parent or any of
its subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting controls, including
any complaint,  



 

35  allegation, assertion or claim that Parent or any of its subsidiaries has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No attorney
representing Parent or any of its subsidiaries, whether or not employed by
Parent or any of its subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by
Parent or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Parent
Board or any committee thereof or to any director or officer of Parent.



(e) To the knowledge of Parent, no employee of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries has provided or is providing information to any law enforcement
agency regarding the commission or possible commission of any crime or the
violation or possible violation of any Applicable Law. Neither Parent nor any
of its subsidiaries nor any officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor or
agent of Parent or any such subsidiary has discharged, demoted, suspended,
threatened, harassed or in any other manner discriminated against an employee
of Parent or any of its subsidiaries in the terms and conditions of
employment because of any act of such employee described in 18 U.S.C. §
1514A(a).



Section 3.6. _Information Supplied_. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by Parent or Acquisition for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in (i) the S-4 will, at the time the S-4 is filed with the SEC
and at the time it becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will, at the date
mailed to stockholders of the Company and Parent and at the times of the
Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein in light of the circumstances under which they are made
not misleading. Each of the S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will
comply, as of its mailing date, as to form in all material respects the
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent makes no representation, warranty or
covenant with respect to any information supplied or required to be supplied
by the Company which is contained in or omitted from any of the foregoing
documents or which is incorporated by reference therein.



Section 3.7. _Consents and Approvals; No Violations_. Except for
filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as may be required
under and other applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange
Act, state securities or blue sky laws, the rules and regulations of the

or merger notification laws or regulations of foreign Governmental Entities
and the filing and recordation of the Certificate of Merger as required by
the DGCL, no material filing with or notice to, and no material permit,
authorization, consent or approval of any Governmental Entity is necessary for
the execution and delivery by Parent or Acquisition of this Agreement or the
consummation by Parent or Acquisition of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent or
Acquisition nor the consummation by Parent or Acquisition of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provision of the respective Certificates of Incorporation or bylaws (or
similar governing documents) of Parent or Acquisition, (ii) result in a
violation or breach of or constitute (with or without due  



 

36  notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right of
termination, amendment, cancellation or acceleration or Lien) under any of
the terms, conditions or provisions of any material note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument or
obligation to which Parent or Acquisition or any of Parents other
subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound, or (iii) violate any material order, writ,
injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or
Acquisition or any of Parents other subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets.



Section 3.8. _No Default_. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries
is in (i) breach, default or violation (and no event has occurred that with
notice or the lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach, default or
violation) of any term, condition or provision of its Certificate of
Incorporation or bylaws (or similar governing documents), or (ii) material
breach, default or violation (and no event has occurred that with notice or
the lapse of time, or both, would constitute a breach, default or violation)
of any term, condition or provision of (a) any material note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or other instrument
or obligation to which Parent nor any of its subsidiaries is now a party or
by which it or any of its properties or assets may be bound, or (b) any
material order, writ, injunction, decree, law, statute, rule or regulation
applicable to Parent nor any of its subsidiaries or any of its properties or
assets.



Section 3.9. _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC
Reports filed on or before the date hereof, there is no suit, action,
proceeding, investigation or material claim pending or, to the knowledge of
Parent, any credible threat thereof, against Parent or any of its subsidiaries
or any of their respective properties or assets before any Governmental
Entity. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed on or before the
date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to any
outstanding order, writ, injunction or decree of any Governmental Entity that
reasonably could be expected to result in any loss, expense, charge,
assessment, levy, fine or other liability being imposed upon or incurred by
the Parent or such subsidiary exceeding One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or
that reasonably could be expected to prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. 



Section 3.10. _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. Citigroup Global Markets
(the "Parent Financial Advisor") has delivered to the Parent Board its opinion
to the effect that, as of the date such opinion was delivered, the
Exchange Ratio is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent (the
"Parent Fairness Opinion"). Parent has been authorized by the Parent Financial
Advisor to permit the inclusion of the Parent Fairness Opinion (or, subject to
the prior review and approval of the Parent Financial Advisor (such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld), a reference thereto) in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus. Such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or modified
as of the date hereof. A true and complete copy of the Parent Fairness
Opinion will be delivered to the Company promptly after receipt of written
confirmation thereof.



Section 3.11. _Brokers_. No broker, finder or investment banker (other
than the Parent Financial Advisor) is entitled to any brokerage, finders or
other fee or commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or
Acquisition.



 

37 Section 3.12. _No Prior Activities_. Except for obligations incurred
in connection with its incorporation or organization or the negotiation,
execution and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, Acquisition has neither incurred any obligation or
liability nor engaged in any business or activity of any type or kind or
entered into any agreement or arrangement with any person.



Section 3.13. _No Undisclosed Liabilities; Absence of Changes_. Except
as and to the extent disclosed by Parent in the Parent SEC Reports filed on or
before the date hereof other than liabilities or obligations to suppliers,
vendors, employees and landlords incurred in the ordinary and usual course of
such business consistent with past practices, neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, that would be required by United States
generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected on a consolidated
balance sheet of Parent (including the notes thereto). Except for the
negotiation and execution of this Agreement, between March 31, 2003 and the
date hereof, the Parent and each of its subsidiaries have conducted their
respective businesses in all material respects only in, and have not engaged
in any material transaction other than according to, the ordinary and usual
course of such business consistent with past practices, and there has not
been any Material Adverse Effect on Parent.



Section 3.14. _Compliance with Applicable Law_. Except as disclosed in
the Parent SEC Reports filed on or before the date hereof, each of Parent and
its subsidiaries holds all material permits, licenses, variances, exemptions,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful
conduct of their respective businesses (collectively, the "Parent Permits").
Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed on or before the date
hereof, Parent and its subsidiaries have materially complied, and are in
material compliance with, the terms of Parent Permits. Except as disclosed in
the Parent SEC Reports, the businesses of Parent and its subsidiaries have
been and are being conducted in material compliance with all material
Applicable Laws. Except as disclosed in the Parent SEC Reports filed on or
before the date hereof, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity
with respect to Parent or any of its subsidiaries is pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened.



Section 3.15 _Suppliers and Customers_. The documents and information
supplied by Parent to the Company or any of its representatives with respect
to relationships and volumes of business done with Parents or any of its
subsidiaries significant suppliers and customers are accurate in all
material respects. During the last twelve (12) months, neither Parent nor any
or its subsidiaries has received any written notices of termination or written
threats of termination from any of the ten (10) largest suppliers or the
twenty-five (25) largest customers of Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.



Section 3.16 _Parent Employee Benefit Matters_.



(a) Section 3.16(a) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule lists, with respect
to employees in the United States of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent
and its subsidiaries, all employee benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA) and all bonus, stock option, stock purchase, restricted stock, long
term incentive, deferred compensation, retiree medical or life insurance,
supplemental retirement, severance or other benefit plans, programs or  



 

38  arrangements, and all employment, change in control, and severance
agreements, to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries is a party,
with respect to which Parent or any of its subsidiaries has any obligation or
which are maintained, contributed to or sponsored by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries for the benefit of any current or former employee, officer or
director of Parent or any of its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Parent
Benefit Plans"), other than plans, programs, arrangements or agreements that
are not material. Copies or summaries of each material Parent Benefit Plan
have been made available to the Company. Neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries has any written commitment to create, adopt or amend any material
employee benefit plan, program, arrangement or agreement, other than any
immaterial modification or any modification or change required by Applicable
Law.



(b) Each Parent Benefit Plan is now in all respects in compliance with its
terms and with the requirements of all applicable laws and regulations,
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code, except where any non-
compliance would not reasonably be likely, individually or in the aggregate,
to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To the knowledge of Parent, no
action, claim or proceeding is pending or threatened with respect to any
Parent Benefit Plan, other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course
and other than such actions, claims or proceedings that could not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect.



Section 3.17 _Parent Intellectual Property_. Parent (or one of its
subsidiaries) owns all of the Intellectual Property, or has obtained the right
to use all of the Intellectual Property that is not owned by it, that is used
in any material respect in Parents businesses as currently conducted. The
products marketed, sold or licensed to customers by Parent and its
subsidiaries, exclusive of the Intellectual Property licensed from third
parties, and all Intellectual Property owned by Parent (or one of its
subsidiaries) and used in any material respect in Parents businesses as
currently conducted, do not infringe upon, violate or constitute the
unauthorized use of any valid and enforceable rights owned or controlled by
any third party, including any Intellectual Property of any third party. To
Parents knowledge, the Intellectual Property it has licensed from third
parties, and used in any material respect in Parents businesses as currently
conducted, does not infringe upon, violate or constitute the unauthorized use
of any valid and enforceable rights owned or controlled by any other third
party. To Parents knowledge, no Significant Parent Product contains any
material defects, the costs of which to repair or replace (or otherwise cure
pursuant to a contractual obligation to a customer) would result in a Material
Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent has received no formal written notice
terminating or threatening the termination of any Parent Technology License
due to Parents breach thereof. For the purposes of this Section 3.17,
"Significant Parent Product" means any product sold by Parent to third party
end users that accounts for a substantial portion of Parents revenue and
"Parent Technology License" means any technology license between Parent and
any third party which allows Parent to embed technology in a Significant
Parent Product.



Section 3.18 _Representations Complete_. The representations and
warranties made by Parent and Acquisition in this Agreement, the statements
made in any certificates furnished by Parent and Acquisition pursuant to this
Agreement, and the statements made by Parent and Acquisition in any documents
mailed, delivered or furnished to the stockholders of Parent and the Company
in connection with soliciting their proxy or consent to this  



 

39  Agreement and the Merger, do not contain and will not contain, as of their
respective dates and as of the Effective Time, any untrue statement of a
material fact, nor do they omit or will they omit, as of their respective
dates or as of the Effective Time, to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained herein or therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Section 4.2. _Preparation of S-4 and the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus; Stockholders Meetings_ _._



(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate in preparing and each shall cause to be filed
with the SEC mutually acceptable proxy materials that shall constitute the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and Parent shall prepare and file with the
SEC the S-4. The Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a
prospectus in and will constitute a part of the S-4 as Parents prospectus
and, subject to the provisions of Section 4.3(b), shall include the Company
Recommendation and the Parent Recommendation. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and to keep the S-4 effective as
long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide the other party with copies of any
written comments and advise each other of any oral comments with respect to
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or S-4 received from the SEC. Each party
shall cooperate and provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any amendment or supplement to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 prior to filing such with the SEC and will
provide each other with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or
supplement (including by incorporation by reference) to the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the S-4 shall be made without the approval of both
Parent and the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; _provided_ that, with respect to documents filed by a party hereto
that are incorporated by reference in the S-4 or Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to
information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition
or results of operations; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company,
in connection with a Change in the Company Recommendation, may amend or
supplement the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or S-4 (including by
incorporation by reference) pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such
a Change, and in such event, this right of approval shall apply only with
respect to information relating to the other party or its business, financial
condition or results of operations, and shall be subject to the right of each
party to have its Board of Directors deliberations and conclusions be
accurately described. Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to Parents stockholders,
and the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to the Companys stockholders, in each
case, as  



 

45  promptly as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective under
the Securities Act. Each party hereto will advise the other party, promptly
after it receives notice thereof, of the time when the S-4 has become
effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the qualification
of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the S-4. If, at any time prior to the
Effective Time, any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent
or the Company and such information should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any of the S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that
any of such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the
party hereto discovering such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and, to the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and disseminated to the stockholders of
Parent and the Company. Parent shall also take any commercially reasonable
action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it
is now not so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state
securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Stock in the
Merger and upon the exercise of Company Stock Options, and the Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of Shares as
may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.



(b) The Company shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable on a
date determined in accordance with the mutual agreement of Parent and the
Company for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and
subject to Section 4.3, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
the Company Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone (i) the
Company Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
necessary supplement or amendment to this S-4 and/or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to the Companys stockholders in advance of
a vote on the Merger and this Agreement or (ii) the time for which the Company
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the S-4 and the
Proxy Statement), if there are insufficient Shares represented, either in
person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Company Stockholders Meeting. The Company Board shall recommend the
approval of the plan of merger contained in this Agreement by the stockholders
of the Company to the effect as set forth in Section 2.3(b) (the "Company
Recommendation"), and shall not (i) withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner
adverse to Parent such recommendation or (ii) take any action or make any
statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent
with such recommendation (collectively, a "Change in the Company
Recommendation"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board may evaluate
whether to make and may make pursuant to Section 4.3 a Change in the Company
Recommendation prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting pursuant to Section
4.3 hereof and may make any statement required by 14d-9 or 14e-2 of the
Exchange Act. Notwithstanding any Change in the Company Recommendation, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the  



 

46  purpose of approving and adopting this Agreement and the Merger and nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to relieve Company of such obligation.



(c) Parent shall duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable on a
date determined in accordance with the mutual agreement of Parent and the
Company for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval and,
except as set forth in this Section 4.2(c), shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit the Parent Stockholder Approval. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent may adjourn or postpone
(i) the Parent Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
necessary supplement or amendment to this S-4 and/or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus is provided to Parents stockholders in advance of
a vote on the Merger and this Agreement or (ii) the time for which the Parent
Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the S-4 and the
Proxy Statement), if there are insufficient Shares represented, either in
person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business
of the Parent Stockholders Meeting. The Parent Board shall recommend the
approval of issuance of Parent Common Stock in the Merger by the stockholders
of Parent (the "Parent Recommendation"), and shall not (i) withdraw, modify
or qualify in any manner adverse to the Company such recommendation or (ii)
take any action or make any statement in connection with the Parent
Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Parent Board may evaluate whether to make and may make
any statement required by 14d-9 or 14e-2 of the Exchange Act.



Section 4.3. _No Solicitation or Negotiation_.



(a) The Company, its Subsidiaries and other affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, representatives (including the Company
Financial Advisor or any other investment banker and any attorneys and
accountants) shall, and the Company shall use all reasonable efforts to
cause its and its Subsidiaries and other affiliates respective non-officer
employees with managerial responsibilities and agents to, immediately cease
any discussions or negotiations with any parties with respect to any Third
Party Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees promptly to request each
person that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with its consideration of acquiring (whether by merger, acquisition of stock
or assets or otherwise) the Company or any Subsidiary, if any, to return (or
if permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all
confidential information heretofore furnished to such person by or on behalf
of the Company or any Subsidiary and, if requested by Parent, to enforce such
persons obligation to do so. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary or other
affiliates shall, nor shall the Company authorize or permit any of its or
their respective officers, directors or representatives to, and the Company
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries and other
affiliates respective non-officer employees with managerial responsibilities
and agents not to, directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit, participate in
or initiate discussions or negotiations with or provide any information to or
enter into any agreement with any person or group (other than Parent and
Acquisition or any designees of Parent and Acquisition) concerning any Third
Party Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with legal counsel, that it
is necessary to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys stockholders under the DGCL, the  



 

47  Company may, in response to an unsolicited written Third Party Acquisition
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, based
on consultation with the Company Financial Advisor, is from a Third Party
that is capable of consummating a Superior Proposal and only for so long as
the Board of Directors so determines in good faith that its actions are
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, (i) furnish only to any
Third Party pursuant to a confidentiality agreement in a form substantially
similar to the Nondisclosure Agreement (A) the information with respect to the
Company of the same type and scope that the Company provided to Parent prior
to the date hereof and (B) any such additional information that such Third
Party requests, but only if the Company is permitted, and does in fact,
simultaneously furnish such additional information to Parent, and
(ii) participate in discussions and negotiations regarding such Third Party
Acquisition Proposal; _provided, further_ , that nothing herein shall prevent
the Company Board from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a
position contemplated by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange
Act with regard to any tender or exchange offer. The Company shall promptly
(and in any event within one (1) day after the Company attains knowledge
thereof) (x) notify Parent in the event the Company or any Subsidiary or
other affiliates or any of their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents receives any Third Party Acquisition Proposal, including the terms and
conditions thereof and the identity of the party submitting such proposal,
and any request for confidential information made in connection with a Third
Party Acquisition Proposal, (y) provide a copy of any written agreements,
proposals or other materials the Company receives from any such person or
group (or its representatives), and (z) promptly, and in any event within one
(1) day, advise Parent of any material modifications thereto.



(b) Except as set forth in this Section 4.3(b), the Company Board shall not
make a Change in the Company Recommendation or approve or recommend, or cause
or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent, agreement or
obligation with respect to, any Third Party Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company Board by a majority vote
determines in its good faith judgment prior to the Company Stockholders
Meeting, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that it is required to
make a Change in the Company Recommendation in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties, the Company Board may recommend a Superior Proposal, but
only (i) after providing written notice to Parent (a "Notice of Superior
Proposal") advising Parent that the Company Board has received a Superior
Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and identifying the person making such Superior Proposal and (ii) if
Parent does not, within five (5) days of Parents receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal, make an offer that the Company Board by a majority vote
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Company
Financial Advisor or another financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) to be at least as favorable to the Companys stockholders as such
Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Change in the Company
Recommendation shall relieve the Company of its obligation to submit this
Agreement and such transactions to its stockholders for approval, as provided
in Section 4.2(b). Any disclosure that the Company Board may be compelled to
make with respect to the receipt of a Third Party Acquisition Proposal or
otherwise in order to comply with its fiduciary duties or Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2
will not constitute a violation of this Agreement, _provided_ that such
disclosure states that no action will be taken by the Company Board in
violation of this Section 4.3(b).



 

48 (c) For the purposes of this Agreement, "Third Party Acquisition Proposal"
means, other than in connection with the Merger or as otherwise specifically
contemplated by this Agreement, any proposal relating to (i) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization or other
similar transaction or series of related transactions involving the Company or

immediately preceding such transaction hold, directly or indirectly, less than
ninety percent (90%) of the equity interests in the surviving or resulting
entity of such transaction or in any parent entity immediately following such
transaction; (ii) any sale, lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition
(including by way of merger, consolidation or exchange), in a single

consolidated revenues of the Company; (iii) any tender offer, exchange offer
or similar transactions or series of related transactions made by any person

(as determined pursuant to Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) of more than ten
percent (10%) of the Companys common stock or the common stock of any
Subsidiary of the Company; or (v) any other substantially similar transaction
or series of related transactions that reasonably could be expected to result
in the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Company. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Third Party" means a person (which includes a "person" as
such term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) other than
Parent, Acquisition or any affiliate thereof. For purposes of this Agreement,
a "Superior Proposal" means any _bona fide_ Third Party Acquisition Proposal
(1) to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting solely
of cash and/or publicly-traded securities (including securities that will be
publicly-traded immediately upon the consummation of such Superior Proposal),

or substantially all of the assets of the Company, (2) that contains terms
and conditions that the Company Board by a majority vote determines in good
faith (after consultation with the Company Financial Advisor or another
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) to be more favorable

majority vote determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with

recognized reputation and its legal counsel) to be reasonably capable of being
completed (taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the proposal and the person making the proposal), (4) that does
not contain a "right of first refusal" or "right of first offer" with respect
to any counter-proposal that Parent might make, and (5) that does not contain
any "due diligence" condition and for which any financing upon which it is
conditioned is committed.

expenses (including counsel fees and expenses), settlement, payments or
liabilities arising out of or in connection with any claim, demand, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was an officer or
director of the Company or any Subsidiary, whether or not pertaining to any
matter existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and whether or
not asserted or claimed prior to or at or after the Effective Time
("Indemnified Liabilities"); and (ii) all Indemnified Liabilities based in
whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of or pertaining to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the
fullest extent required or permitted under Applicable Law. Nothing contained
herein shall make Parent, Acquisition, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, an insurer, a co-insurer or an excess insurer in respect of any
insurance policies which may provide coverage for Indemnified Liabilities, nor
shall this Section 4.9 relieve the obligations of any insurer in respect
thereto. The parties hereto intend, to the extent not prohibited by Applicable
Law, that the indemnification provided for in this Section 4.9 shall apply
without limitation to negligent acts or omissions by an Indemnified Person.
Each Indemnified Person is intended to be a third party beneficiary of this
Section 4.9 and may specifically enforce its terms. This Section 4.9 shall not
limit or otherwise adversely affect any rights any Indemnified Person
may have under any agreement with the Company or under the Companys
Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws as presently in effect.



 

52 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between the Company and
its directors and officers as of or prior to the date hereof (or
indemnification agreements in the Companys customary form for directors
joining the Company Board prior to the Effective Time) and any indemnification
provisions under the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent will
maintain or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect, if
available, directors and officers liability insurance covering those persons
who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, are covered by the
Companys directors and officers liability insurance policy (the "Insured
Parties") on terms no less favorable to the Insured Parties than those of the
Companys present directors and officers liability insurance policy;
_provided, however_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend on an annual basis in excess of 200% of the
annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage; _provided
further_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such coverage is
no longer available (or is only available for an amount in excess of 200% of
the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage), Parent
shall nevertheless use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount; _provided further_ , that,
in lieu of maintaining such existing insurance as provided above, Parent, at
its election, may cause coverage to be provided under any policy maintained
for the benefit of Parent or any of its subsidiaries, so long as the terms
are no less favorable to the intended beneficiaries thereof than such existing
insurance.



(d) Parent will not, nor will Parent permit the Surviving Corporation to
merge or consolidate with any other Person or sell all or substantially all
of Parents or such subsidiarys assets unless Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will ensure that the surviving or resulting entity assumes the
obligations imposed by this Section 4.9.



Section 4.10. _Notification of Certain Matters; Additions to and
Modification of Disclosure Schedules_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent and Acquisition, and Parent and Acquisition shall give prompt notice
to the Company (such notice by delivery of supplements to the Company
Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable), of (i)
the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event the occurrence or nonoccurrence
of which has caused or would be likely to cause any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement by such first party to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect at or prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
any material failure by the Company, Parent or Acquisition, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 4.10
shall not cure such breach or non-compliance, be deemed to constitute an
exception to the representations and warranties under Article 2 or Article 3,
or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice, _provided, further_ , that any addition to Section
2.1(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule disclosing a Subsidiary acquired or
organized after the date hereof, Section 2.1(c) of the Company Disclosure

2.11(b) disclosing any Company Employee

becomes a Company Affiliate after the date hereof, or Section 3.16 of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule disclosing any Parent benefit plan adopted

date hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a breach of the related
representation or warranty,  _provided further_ that such disclosure referred
to in the immediately preceding proviso shall not limit or otherwise affect
the remedies available hereunder to either party to the extent that the
action, event, occurrence or agreement disclosed was in violation or breach
of this Agreement, including Section 4.1.



Section 4.11. _Affiliates_. The Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from all Company Affiliates, and from any person
who may be deemed to have become a Company Affiliate after the date of this
Agreement and on or prior to the Effective Time, a letter agreement
substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ hereto as soon as practicable. Parent
shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the S-4 for the
purpose of resale of shares of Parent Common Stock by stockholders of the
Company who may be affiliates of the Company or Parent pursuant to Rule 145
under the Securities Act.



Section 4.12. _Access to Company Employees_. The Company agrees to
provide, and to cause each Subsidiary to provide, Parent with reasonable
access to its employees under procedures to be agreed upon by Parent and the
Company during normal working hours following the date of this Agreement, to
among other things, deliver offers of continued employment and to provide
information to such employees about Parent. All communications by Parent with
Company employees shall be conducted in a manner that does not disrupt or
interfere with the Companys efficient and orderly operation of its business.



Section 4.13. _Company Compensation and Benefit Plans_. The Company
agrees to take all actions necessary to amend, merge, freeze or terminate any
or all Company Employee Plans intended to constitute a Code Section 401(k)
arrangement, the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the 1997 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan for Non-United States Employees and any other employee stock
purchase plan effective at or immediately prior to the Closing Date, each as
requested in writing by Parent no later than five (5) business days prior to
the Closing Date (thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date with respect to
the  



 

54  1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for
Non-United States Employees and any other employee stock purchase plan).



Section 4.14 _Employee Benefits_.



(a) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall arrange for each participant
in the Company Employee Plans (the "Company Participants") (including without
limitation all dependents) who becomes a Parent employee (or an employee of
any Parent subsidiary or affiliate) after the Closing Date to be eligible for
the same benefits in the aggregate as those received by Parent employees with
similar positions and responsibilities and qualifications; provided, however,
that through December 31, 2003 Parent may instead, at its option, continue a
Company Employee Plan in lieu of providing benefits under a corresponding
Parent Benefit Plan. Each Company Participant shall, to the extent permitted
by law, the plan governing the benefits (as reasonably amended to accomplish
the following to the extent permissible under applicable law) and applicable
tax qualification requirements, and subject to any applicable break in service
or similar rule, receive credit for all purposes including, without
limitation, for eligibility to participate, amount of matching contributions,
and vesting under Parent Benefit Plans for years of service with the Company
(and its Subsidiaries and predecessors) prior to the Closing Date. If
applicable and to the extent possible under Parents existing plans (as
reasonably amended to the extent necessary in accordance with applicable law),
Parent shall cause any and all pre-existing condition (or actively at work or
similar) limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any Parent Benefit Plans to be waived with respect to such
Company Participants and their eligible dependents and shall provide them
with credit for any co-payments, deductibles, and offsets (or similar
payments) made during the plan year including the Closing Date for the
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar
requirements under any Parent Benefit Plans in which they are eligible to
participate after the Closing Date.



(b) Parent agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, the Company
employees who become employees of Parent or any of its subsidiaries may
participate in the employee stock purchase plan sponsored by Parent (the
"Parent ESPP"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent ESPP, and
that service with the Company shall be treated as service with Parent or its
subsidiaries for determining eligibility of the Companys employees under the
Parent ESPP. Unless Parent elects to continue the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan or the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan for Non-United States Employees,
Parent agrees to create a special offering period under the Parent ESPP so
that the Company employees who become employees of Parent or any of its
subsidiaries can participate in the Parent ESPP within thirty (30) days from
the Closing Date.



Section 4.15. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute or any
similar statute, law, rule or regulation in any State of the United States
(including under the DGCL or any other law of the State of Delaware) is or may
become applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Company and the Company Board shall promptly grant such
approvals and take such lawful actions as are necessary so that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise take such lawful
actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute, law, rule or
regulation, on such transactions.



 

55 Section 4.16. _Company Rights Agreement_. The Company Board shall take
all further action (in addition to that referenced in Section 2.25) to the
extent necessary (including amending the Company Rights Agreement) in order
to ensure that following or as a result of the execution of this Agreement or
the Company Voting Agreements, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, (i) no person shall be deemed to be
an Acquiring Person; (ii) no person shall have the ability to exercise any
Company Rights under the Company Rights Agreement; (iii) no Company Rights
shall have separated from the Shares to which they are attached or become
exercisable; and (iv) the Company shall not have the right to exchange any
Company Rights for Shares, pursuant to Section 24 of the Company Rights
Agreement or otherwise. Except in connection with the foregoing sentence, the
Company Board shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, (i)
amend the Company Rights Agreement, or (ii) take any action with respect to,
or make any determination under, the Company Rights Agreement, including a
redemption of the Company Rights, in each case in order to facilitate
any Third Party Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company; provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company Board may (i) amend the Company Rights Agreement solely for the
purpose of extending the Distribution Date thereunder to that time
immediately prior to the consummation of an unsolicited exchange or tender
offer by a third party and (ii) take any action in connection with the Company
Rights Agreement that is required by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction.



Section 4.17. _Parent Board of Directors_. Parent shall take all
requisite action to appoint Mr. Michael J. Maples to the Parent Board as a
member of Class I and as a member of the Corporate Governance/Nominating
Committee as of the Effective Time, provided that if Mr. Maples is unable or
unwilling to serve on the Parent Board at the Effective Time, Parent shall
instead take all requisite action to appoint such other person as the Company
may designate and who is reasonably acceptable to Parent.



Section 4.18. _Section 16 Matters_. If the Company delivers the Section
16 Information to Parent at least 10 business days prior to the Effective
Time, then, prior to the Effective Time, the Parent Board, or an appropriate
committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretative guidance of the SEC so that (i) the
assumption of the Company Stock Options held by Company Insiders in the
Merger, and (ii) the receipt by Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in
exchange for Shares pursuant to the Merger, shall in each case be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. For purposes of
this Section 4.18, (1) "Company Insider" shall mean any officer or director
of the Company who may become a covered person of Parent for purposes of
Section 16 of the Exchange Act and (2) "Section 16 Information" shall mean
the following information for each Company Insider: (A) the number of Shares
held by such individual and expected to be exchanged for shares of Parent
Common Stock in the Merger; and (B) the number of Company Stock Options held
by such individual and expected to be converted into options to purchase
shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

contemplated hereby.



Section 6.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by action taken
by the Company, Parent and Acquisition at any time before or after approval

assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

Section 7.5. _Governing Law and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.



(a) This Agreement shall be deemed to be made in and in all respects shall
be interpreted, construed and governed by and in accordance with the law of
the state of Delaware without regard to the conflict of law principles
thereof. The parties hereby  



 

64  irrevocably and unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
courts of the Court of Chancery of Delaware and the Federal courts of the
United States of America located in the State of Delaware solely in respect of
the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of
the transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to
assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation
or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto
or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not
maintainable in said courts or that the venue thereof may not be appropriate
or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in or by such
courts, and the parties hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect
to such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware
State or Federal court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court
jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of
such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection
with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 7.4 or in
such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid
and sufficient service thereof.



(b) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in any Federal court located in the State of Delaware or in
Delaware state court, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity.



(c) Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may
arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult
issues, and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
litigation directly or indirectly arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party certifies and
acknowledges that (i) no representative, agent or attorney of any other party
has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in
the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver, (ii) each such
party understands and has considered the implications of this waiver, (iii)
each such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (iv) each such party has
been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the waivers
and certifications in this Section 7.5.



Section 7.6. _Descriptive Headings_. The descriptive headings herein
are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part
of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.



Section 7.7. _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and its successors
and permitted assigns and, except as expressly provided herein, nothing in
this Agreement is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any
rights, benefits or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of
this Agreement nor shall any such person be entitled to assert any claim
hereunder. In no event shall this Agreement constitute a third party

issuance of injunctive relief by any court of competent jurisdiction to
compel performance of such partys obligations and to the granting by any
court of the remedy of specific performance of its obligations hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if a party hereto receives all payments and
