(s) _La Porte Interests_. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.01(s) hereto: (1) the financial statements  of La Porte GP and La Porte LP attached hereto as part of Schedule 4.01(s) accurately reflect  the financial condition of La Porte GP and La Porte LP as of December 31, 2000 and December 31,  2001, and the capital accounts of D-K LLC and D-K III, and (2) there has been no material  change or impairment of that condition or of those accounts since December 31, 2001.   (t) _Ownership of the Assets_. The Splitter Assets are owned and will be owned at the Closing  by Sellers or by the specific legal entities and in the divided or undivided ownership  percentages set forth in Section 2.02 and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, free and clear of all  Liens.   ARTICLE V  _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY BUYER_    PAGE 15    5.01 _Buyer_. Buyer represents and warrants to Sellers that the matters set forth below in this Section 5.01 are as of the date hereof, and further warrants that such representations and warranties shall be as of Closing, true and accurate in all material respects in accordance with their terms:   (a) _Organization and Standing_. Buyer is a limited partnership duly organized, validly  existing, and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.   (b) _Authorization_. Being approved by the general partner of Buyer, Buyer has the power and  authority to enter into and perform this Agreement and the other documents to be executed by  Buyer hereunder, to carry out the transactions contemplated herein, and to close the  transactions contemplated hereby.   (c) _Enforceability_. This Agreement has been, and at the Closing the other documents to be  executed by Buyer will have been, duly executed and delivered by Buyer and constitute or will  constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of Buyer, enforceable in accordance with  its terms, except as that enforceability may be (1) limited by an applicable bankruptcy,  insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors\'  rights generally, and (2) subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such  enforceability is considered in a Proceeding in equity or at law).   (d) _Legal Proceedings_. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.01(d), there are no outstanding  Orders of any Governmental Body or, to the knowledge of Buyer, any Proceedings which would  prevent it from consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, to the  knowledge of Buyer, there are no Proceedings threatened in writing or pending against,  involving, or which might affect or impair the Splitter Assets.   (e) _No Violations_. This transaction will not (i) violate or conflict with any provision of  Buyer\'s organizational documents; (ii) result in the breach of any term or condition of, or  terminate or constitute a default or cause the acceleration of any obligation under, any  agreement or instrument to which Buyer is a party or is otherwise bound; (iii) violate or  conflict with any applicable Legal Requirement or Order; or (iv) require Buyer to obtain any  consent, approval, or waiver from any Governmental Body, except (A) compliance with the HSR  Act; or (B) approvals from those Governmental Bodies (other than pursuant to the HSR Act) or  other Persons listed in Schedule 5.01(e).   (f) _Securities Representation_. Buyer is acquiring the Splitter Assets for Buyer\'s own  account and not with a view to, or for offer of resale in connection with, a distribution  thereof, within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933.   (g) _Non-foreign Entity_. Buyer is not a non-resident alien, foreign corporation, foreign partnership,  or foreign estate for purposes of U.S. income taxation.   ARTICLE VI  _COVENANTS_    6.01 _Casualty Loss/Condemnation_.   (a) _Casualty Loss._ Prior to the Effective Time, if all or any portion of the Splitter  Assets have been or are destroyed by fire, flood, storm, or other casualty of a similar nature  (all of which are herein called a "Casualty Loss") and if such Casualty Loss is reasonably  determined to require repairs that will cost in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the Purchase  Price, then either Party shall have the right and option to declare this Agreement to be  terminated by written notice given to the other Party within thirty (30) days after the  occurrence of the Casualty Loss. Should such damage not be to such extent or should it be to  such extent but neither Party elects to so terminate this Agreement, then Sellers shall proceed  to repair any such damage or destruction as soon as is reasonably practicable following the   PAGE 16    expiration of said thirty (30) day period to the condition and operating levels and  efficiencies as existed immediately prior to such Casualty Loss, and upon completion of such  repair and all necessary testing and start-up, the transaction contemplated hereby will close,  subject to the other terms of this Agreement. Any insurance proceeds relating to a Casualty  Loss occurring while Sellers have the risk of loss shall be the sole property of Sellers. The  risk of Casualty Loss occurring after the Effective Time with respect to the Splitter Assets  shall pass to Buyer at Closing.   (b) _Condemnation_. If, prior to the Effective Time, all or a portion of the Splitter Assets  are taken by condemnation or are subject to being taken by a written threat of condemnation,  and if such taking or threat of a taking does, or would, materially limit Buyer\'s use of the  Splitter Assets or its ability to benefit from the full value to be paid for the Splitter  Assets, then Sellers shall promptly give written notice of such condemnation or condemnation  proceedings to Buyer and Buyer may terminate this Agreement upon prior written notice to  Sellers of at least fourteen (14) days or the number of days left until Closing, whichever is  fewer. If Buyer terminates this Agreement under this Section 6.01(b), any payments made under  threat of condemnation or condemnation awards shall be the sole property of Sellers. If Buyer  does not elect to terminate this Agreement, or cannot terminate this Agreement because the  taking or threatened taking did not or would not materially limit Buyer\'s use of the Splitter  Assets or its ability to benefit from the full value to be paid for the Splitter Assets, such  payments or awards shall be the sole property of Buyer.   6.02 _Conduct of Business Between Signing of this Agreement and Effective Time_.   (a) Between signing of this Agreement and the Effective Time, Sellers shall preserve and maintain  the Splitter Assets in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.   (b) Without the consent of Buyer (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and  prior to the Closing, Sellers shall not and shall not commit or agree to do, any of the  following:   (1) waive, compromise, or settle any right or Proceeding involving or relating to the  Splitter Assets or any Liabilities/Claims in respect thereof which singularly or in the  aggregate exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00);   (2) create, incur, or assume any Lien on or with respect to any Splitter Assets or any  income or profits therefrom;   (3) enter into or agree to any agreement or arrangement granting any rights to purchase  any of the Splitter Assets or the assets of La Porte Pipeline, except for agreements relating  to sales of inventory in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices;   (4) enter into, renew, extend, amend, or terminate any Contract or renew, amend, or  terminate any Real Property Instrument; and any other contracts relating to the operation, use,  or conduct of the business of the Splitter Assets may be entered into by Sellers only in the  ordinary course of business consistent with their past practice; provided that the aggregate  amount of obligations of all such other contracts shall not exceed Five Hundred Thousand  Dollars ($500,000.00);   (5) except as specifically provided for herein, transfer or sell, or agree to transfer or  sell, any part of the Splitter Assets; or   (6) except as otherwise provided for herein, terminate any Real Property Instrument or  Permit.   6.03 _Compliance with Conditions Precedent_. Each Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions precedent to Closing set forth in Sections 8.02 and 8.03, applicable to such Party, to be fulfilled and satisfied as soon as practicable but in any event prior to Closing.   PAGE 17    6.04 _Press Release_. Buyer expects to issue a press release upon the execution of this Agreement. Buyer and Sellers shall consult with each other in a good faith effort to agree upon the mutually-acceptable substance of such a press release and with regard to all publicity and other releases issued at or prior to Closing concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and except as required by Legal Requirements, neither Party shall issue any publicity or other release without the prior written consent of the other Party (which such consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   6.05 _Insurance_. Sellers shall keep, or cause to be kept, all existing insurance policies on the Splitter Assets in full force and effect through the close of business on the Closing Date.   6.06 _Consents to Assignment - Formation of Diamond-Koch_. Schedule 6.06 lists the Contracts and Real Property Instruments for which consent to assignment (including waivers of rights of first refusal or preferential purchase rights) is required, that were to be assigned to D-K I or D-K III in connection with the formation of the Diamond-Koch venture of which D-K I and D-K III are a part, and with respect to which such consent has not yet been obtained. Sellers shall, at Sellers\' sole cost and expense, use reasonable commercial efforts and diligence to obtain all such required consents, approvals, and waivers and deliver evidence of same reasonably satisfactory to Buyer as soon as reasonably practicable and whether before or after the Closing Date. Any and all cost and expense relating to such consents, approvals, and waivers obtained pursuant to this Section 6.06 shall be Sellers\' sole obligation.   6.07 _Consents to Assignment to Buyer._    (a) _Buyer\'s Obligations._ If the assignment or transfer of Contracts, Real Property  Instruments or Permits hereunder requires the consent of a third Person, except to the extent  of Sellers\' undertakings pursuant to Sections 6.06, 6.07(b) and 6.07(d), Buyer, at its sole  cost and expense, hereby assumes all obligations and responsibilities of obtaining such  consents.   (b) _Sellers\' Pre-Closing Obligations._ With respect to the required consents referenced in  Section 6.07(a), upon the execution of this Agreement, Sellers will use commercially reasonable  diligence to obtain such consents from the Persons from whom consent is required. To the  extent commercially reasonable, Sellers shall obtain such consents prior to Closing and shall  provide documentation of such consents to Buyer at Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the  contrary provided for in this Section 6.07(b) above, if the Closing occurs within five (5)  Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Sellers need not perform the covenants provided  for in this Section 6.07(b), and Buyer shall be responsible for initiating and completing the  consent requests described herein.   (c) _Consents Not Obtained by Closing._ Except as provided in Section 7.04, at Closing,  Sellers shall provide their files to Buyer relating to their efforts to obtain the consents not  obtained by Closing if required pursuant to Section 6.07(b). Buyer shall thereafter exercise  reasonable diligence to obtain such consents. The Parties shall assist each other with  respect to obtaining such consents until Sellers\' obligations expire as provided for in the  last sentence of this Section 6.07(c) or until such other time as mutually agreed. With respect  to Contracts and Real Property Instruments for which consents are not obtained by Closing  including the consents referred to in Section 6.06 (or, despite Buyer\'s efforts after Closing,  are not later obtained) (respectively the "Non-Conveyed Contracts" and "Non-Conveyed Real  Property Instruments"), Sellers shall, upon Buyer\'s written request, take commercially  reasonable steps and actions to provide Buyer with the benefit of such Non-Conveyed Contracts  and Non-Conveyed Real Property Instruments. Buyer shall enter into subcontracting or other  beneficial arrangements with Sellers or an Affiliate thereof pursuant to which Buyer shall  fulfill such obligations or liabilities at no additional expense to Sellers except Sellers\' own  costs in entering into, administering, and managing such arrangements. Sellers\' obligation to  provide such benefit with respect to a particular Non-Conveyed Contract shall expire  concurrently with the earlier of (a) the expiration of that Non-Conveyed Contract according to  its terms or (b) the earliest time that such Non-Conveyed Contract may be terminated by Buyer   PAGE 18    (as Sellers\' assignee) without breach thereof. Sellers\' obligation to provide such benefit  with respect to all Non-Conveyed Real Property Instruments shall expire concurrently with the  expiration of that Non-Conveyed Real Property Instrument according to its terms.   (d) _Certain Real Property Instruments._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in  Sections 6.07(a), (b) or (c), the provisions of this Section 6.07(d) govern consents to  assignment of Non-Conveyed Real Property Instruments pertaining to the following pipelines:  Amoco Lateral, Solvay Lateral, MCO Lateral, MCO to Texas City Pipeline, Amoco (Texas City)  Lateral, and ARCO Lateral. If, by Closing, any required consents for such Non-Conveyed Real  Property Instruments have not yet been obtained, Sellers will continue to pursue such consents,  with Buyer\'s assistance, until Sellers\' obligations expire as provided for in the last sentence  of Section 6.07(c) or until such other mutually agreed time. If, as a condition to granting  such consent, the landowner/grantor requires a one-time payment, and if Sellers, without making  such payment, are unable to provide Buyer with the benefit of that Non-Conveyed Real Property  Instrument, Sellers shall make the one-time payment and secure the required consent unless the  landowner/grantor specifically states or indicates that payment is being required because of  the identity of Buyer. Sellers covenant and agree that they will not suggest, imply, or in any  manner or fashion influence the landowner/grantor to make such a statement or indication. If,  however, as a condition of granting consent, the landowner/grantor requires some other  modification to the terms and conditions of the Non-Conveyed Real Property Instrument  (including an increase in periodic fees due thereunder), and if without agreement to such  modification Sellers are unable to provide Buyer with the benefit of that Non-Conveyed Real  Property Instrument, then, Buyer shall either agree to such modifications (or negotiate a  mutually agreed upon modification with the landowner/grantor) and obtain such consent, or  failing such, Sellers shall be relieved of all obligations to secure such consent for that  Non-Conveyed Real Property Instrument and Sellers shall have no further obligation or liability  with respect thereto except as set forth below with respect to annual increases in periodic  fees. Sellers covenant and agree that if a landowner/grantor advises Sellers that a one-time  payment of a Non-Conveyed Real Property Instrument will be required in order to secure consent,  Sellers shall not, without first consulting Buyer, suggest to the landowner/grantor other means  of securing the consent (such as modifications of the applicable Non-Conveyed Real Property  Instrument) without first requesting Buyer\'s approval of such other means, which approval shall  not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. Sellers further covenant and agree that  if a landowner/grantor advises Sellers that modifications are required to secure the consent,  Sellers will promptly notify Buyer of the requested modifications without negotiation with the  landowner/grantor.   With respect to increases in periodic fees required by landowners/grantors to secure consent,  if the sum of all increases in such periodic fees with respect to the Non-Conveyed Real  Property Instrument, on an annual basis, exceeds Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000.00)  annually, Sellers shall be obligated to pay Buyer an amount equal to the net present value of  the difference between (i) the sum of all periodic fee increases and (ii) $75,000.00, over a  five year period, using a discount rate of Eight Percent (8%). For example, if the sum of all  periodic fee increases total $100,000, Sellers will owe Buyer the net present value of a  $25,000.00 payment stream over a five year period using the 8% discount rate, or $99,817.00.   Nothing in this Section 6.07(d) modifies the terms of the last sentence of Section 6.07(c).   (e) _Consents - Permits._ Sellers shall have no obligations or liabilities with respect to  any non-assignable or non-transferable Permits. Buyer assumes all responsibility and  obligations for replacing or transferring all Permits and obtaining any permits it may require  to own or operate the Splitter Assets.   6.08 _Assumed Contracts/Instruments_. Buyer agrees to assume all rights and obligations of Sellers arising under the Contracts, Real Property Instruments, Transferred Intellectual Property Interests, Permits, and any contractual commitments made in accordance with Section 6.02 (to the extent transferable) on and   PAGE 19   after the Effective Time to the extent such rights and obligations accrue after the Effective Time and are incurred in accordance with Section 6.02.   6.09 _Inspection_. Prior to Closing, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable advance notice to Sellers, Sellers shall permit the representatives of Buyer to inspect the Splitter Assets and observe the operating and maintenance personnel therein employed, and to further observe any and all activities related to the maintenance, operation, contracting, and administration thereof. Buyer\'s representatives shall be entitled to make copies of any Records. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not be required to grant access to or furnish information which Sellers consider, in their sole judgment, to be confidential to Sellers or to others or which might disclose any techniques or applications which Sellers consider to be business secrets or proprietary information to Sellers. All information furnished to Buyer pursuant to this provision will be deemed to be "Confidential Information" for purposes of that certain "Confidentiality Agreement" described in Section 12.03 below. All inspections shall be conducted in compliance with all of Sellers\' applicable safety procedures, rules, and regulations in effect at the Splitter Assets from time to time, which shall include, without limitation, site safety training and access restriction procedures as are normally required by Sellers of third party invitees. No investigation by Buyer will affect any representation or warranty given by Sellers to Buyer or the remedies available to Buyer hereunder.   ARTICLE VII  _POST-CLOSING AGREEMENTS_    7.01 _Final Recapitulation Settlement; Subsequent Audits and Settlements_. With respect to final recapitulation and audits:   (a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (the "Final Recap Date"), Sellers shall provide  to Buyer, for Buyer\'s review, a proposed final recapitulation settlement in the form of the  Preliminary Settlement Statement (the "Final Recap Statement") to account for all actual  adjustments to the Purchase Price (and Net Inventory) known as of the Final Recap Date if such  actual adjustments differ from those shown on the Closing Statement provided prior to Closing  pursuant to Section 3.02 (the "Final Recap"). These adjustments shall be identified to the  associated Splitter Asset. Buyer shall have the right, within one hundred eighty (180) days  after the Closing Date, to complete an audit of the Final Recap Statement. If Buyer disagrees  with the Final Recap Statement, Buyer and Sellers shall use their respective commercially  reasonable efforts to reach agreement within thirty (30) days following Buyer\'s completion of  its audit of the Final Recap Statement.   (b) Should the Parties be unable to resolve any disagreements concerning the Final Recap Statement,  such disagreement shall, at the earliest practicable date, be referred, by either or both of  the Parties, to a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer and  Sellers (the "Accounting Firm"), along with all audit reports, work papers, schedules, and  calculations related to the matter in dispute. Within twenty-five (25) days after such  submission, the Accounting Firm shall issue a letter report determining the Final Recap, which  shall be final and binding. Any fees and expenses incurred in resolving disputes shall be  borne by the Party incurring such, except for the Accounting Firm, which shall be borne equally  by Buyer on the one hand and Sellers on the other hand.   (c) Payment of any amounts owed under the Final Recap is due within ten (10) days after the date  Sellers and Buyer agree on the Final Recap Statement, or within ten (10) days after the  determination of the Final Recap by the Accounting Firm, whichever is later.   PAGE 20    7.02 _Accounts Receivable_. After Closing, Sellers agree to cause to be paid to Buyer any amounts received by Sellers, including accounts receivables generated by the Splitter Assets after the Effective Time, to which Buyer is entitled but which is made instead to Sellers for whatever reason. After Closing, Buyer agrees to cause to be paid to Sellers any amounts received by Buyer after the Effective Time, including accounts receivables generated by the Splitter Assets prior to the Effective Time, to which Sellers are entitled but which are made instead to Buyer for whatever reason.   7.03 _Recording_. Except for the recording of the consents or approvals to the assignments described in Section 6.06 (for which Sellers shall promptly furnish the recording information to Buyer), Buyer shall be solely responsible for promptly recording the assignments and any other instruments related to the conveyance of any of the Splitter Assets, and shall promptly furnish Sellers with the recording information. All recording and filing fees for instruments to be recorded by a specified Party shall be paid by that Party.   7.04 _Files and Records_. At or prior to the Closing, Sellers shall permit Buyer to take possession of the original set of all hard copy and electronic Records in Sellers\' possession and located at Sellers\' Mont Belvieu, Texas, or Houston, Texas, offices. Other Records shall be made available to Buyer within thirty (30) days after the Closing Date at either Mont Belvieu, Texas, or Houston Texas, as designated by Buyer; provided, however, that Sellers shall, if reasonably needed by Buyer, make copies of such other Records available to Buyer upon Buyer\'s request prior to such time at Sellers\' sole expense. With respect to the accounting records that are not part of the Records, including all records that Buyer may need in order to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sellers shall make available to Buyer such records for inspection and copying during normal business hours. From time to time as requested by Sellers, Buyer shall make such files, records, and data which it acquires from Sellers and which are reasonably required by Sellers available to Sellers for inspection and copying during normal business hours, together with such additional non-privileged, non-protected files, data, and records of Buyer as relate specifically to the Splitter Assets as may be required by Sellers in order to pursue any of their claims, obligations, and disputes relating to the Splitter Assets. If there are records that relate to the Excluded Assets that also relate to the Splitter Assets, Sellers shall have the right to redact any information contained therein that relates exclusively to the Excluded Assets.   7.05 _Use of Sellers\' Names_. By no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after Closing, Buyer shall have covered, removed or caused to have been removed the names and marks of and used by Sellers and all variations and derivations thereof and logos relating thereto from the Splitter Assets and shall either remove all pipeline markers that bear Sellers\' names or place permanent stickers over Sellers\' specific information (i.e., name and telephone number) on such markers. After expiration of such time period specified above, Buyer shall not make any use whatsoever of those names, marks, and logos. If Buyer has not completed such removal within one hundred and twenty (120) days after Closing, Sellers shall have the right, but not the obligation, to take such steps as are required to complete such name change and removal or cause such name change and removal to be completed and Buyer shall reimburse Sellers for any costs or expenses incurred by Sellers in connection therewith.   7.06 _Further Assurances_. Each Party shall, from time to time at the reasonable request of the other, and without further consideration, execute and deliver such other instruments of sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment, clarification, and termination, and take such other action as the Party making the request may reasonably require to fully effectuate the transactions contemplated hereby, including those required to sell, transfer, convey, and assign to, and vest in Buyer, and to place Buyer in possession of the Splitter Assets, or, if necessary, to ensure that Buyer has no interest in any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability and that any interest in such an Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability incorrectly conveyed to Buyer is reconveyed to Sellers. Sellers intend to convey the Splitter Assets at Closing; provided, however, that if it is determined after Closing that: (i) any part of the Splitter Assets were not owned by Sellers and that the title to any part of the Splitter Assets is incorrectly in the name of another entity, or (ii) any Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability is conveyed to Buyer and that the title to such Excluded Asset is incorrectly in the name of Buyer or any Excluded Liability is for the account of Buyer, then each Party shall take all such action necessary to promptly and correctly convey any part of the Splitter Assets to Buyer, or any part of the Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities to Sellers.   PAGE 21    7.07 _Post-Closing Tax Proceedings_. If Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives notice of any examination, adjustment, or other Proceeding relating to the liability for taxes of or with respect to Sellers and concerning the Splitter Assets for any period prior to the Effective Time, Buyer shall notify Sellers in writing within five (5) business days of receiving notice thereof (or such lesser time if such notice given to Buyer requires action in less than five (5) business days). As to any such taxes for which Sellers are or may be liable, Sellers shall, at Sellers\' expense, control or settle the contest of such examination, adjustment, or other Proceeding, and shall defend (upon Buyer\'s request) and indemnify Buyer against all losses in connection therewith. The Parties shall cooperate with each other and with their respective Affiliates in the negotiations and settlement of any Proceeding described in this Section 7.07.   7.08 _Sales Taxes_. The Purchase Price provided for hereunder excludes any sales tax or other taxes required to be paid in connection with the sale of the Splitter Assets. Buyer shall be responsible for all applicable sales and use taxes, gross receipts, conveyance, transfer, and recording fees, motor vehicle transfer and excise taxes and registration fees, and real estate transfer taxes and documentary stamp taxes, if any, that may be imposed on any transfer pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer shall defend (upon Sellers\' request), indemnify, and hold Sellers harmless for any and all sales, use, gross receipts, and similar taxes, penalties, and interest imposed on Sellers based on the sale of the Splitter Assets. To the extent the sale of the Splitter Assets is a sale of tangible personal property, Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers to provide any applicable exemption certificates or other documentation necessary to obtain available tax exempt status for the sale of the Splitter Assets.   7.09 _Other Taxes_.   (a) All taxes (excluding taxes described in Section 7.08) associated with the ownership, operation  or use of any of the Splitter Assets and which have accrued prior to the Effective Time have  been or will be properly paid or withheld by Sellers, and all statements, returns, and  documents pertinent thereto have been or will be properly filed. Sellers shall indemnify,  defend, and hold Buyer harmless from and against all such taxes and related liabilities and  obligations.   (b) Buyer shall defend (upon Sellers\' request) and indemnify Sellers for, and shall be responsible  for, paying or withholding or causing to be paid or withheld all taxes associated with the  ownership, operation, or use of any of the Splitter Assets which have accrued after the  Effective Time and for filing all statements, returns, and documents incident thereto.

(a) Except as specifically provided for in Sections 10.01 through 10.06, commencing at the  Effective Time, Buyer shall indemnify, reimburse, defend, and hold harmless Sellers, their  parent companies, Affiliates, and subsidiaries and their respective partners, members,  Affiliates, directors, shareholders, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, representatives,  contractors, and subcontractors (collectively, "Sellers Indemnitees") from and against: (1) all   PAGE 29    Liabilities/Claims, whether or not caused in whole or in part by the strict liability, fault,  or negligence of Sellers, Buyer Indemnitees or any other Person (whether sole, joint,  concurrent, or comparative with any strict liability, fault, or negligence of Buyer or any  other person) arising from or relating to (A) the ownership or operation of the Splitter Assets  by any Person arising after the Effective Time; (B) the condition of the Splitter Assets,  whether attributable to periods of time before or after the Effective Time; or (C) all  Environmental Liabilities/Claims (other than those covered by Sections 10.01(a) or 10.02),  whether attributable to periods of time before or after the Effective Time; and (2) all  Liabilities/Claims arising from or related to any breach of Buyer\'s express representations,  warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein.   (b) Commencing at the earlier of (1) the time when Sellers and Sellers Guarantors, in the  aggregate, have incurred or paid Liabilities/Claims totaling the sum of Five Million Dollars  ($5,000,000.00) for Offsite Disposal pursuant to Section 10.02 and the other applicable  provisions of this Article X, or (2) the expiration of the period of four (4) years after the  Effective Time (whether or not Sellers and Sellers Guarantors have paid or incurred all or any  part of the $5,000,000.00 amount), Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Sellers  Indemnitees from and against any Liabilities/Claims arising from or relating to Offsite  Disposal, whether attributable to periods of time before or after the Effective Time, and  whether or not Sellers, but for this Section 10.07(b), would be legally liable to the claimant  or to a Buyer Indemnitee or otherwise for such Liabilities/Claims.   (c) Commencing at the earlier of (1) the time when Sellers and Sellers Guarantors, in the  aggregate, have incurred or paid, after the Effective Time, Sellers\' Maximum Liability arising  from or related to the Splitter Assets, or (2) the expiration of the period of five (5) years  after the Effective Time for any Liabilities/Claims for which notice is given to Sellers after  such five (5) year period expires (whether or not Sellers and Sellers Guarantors have paid or  incurred Sellers\' Maximum Liability), Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Sellers  Indemnitees from and against any Liabilities/Claims of any kind or nature (except for a Tax  Liability) arising out of or related to the Splitter Assets, whether attributable to periods of  time before or after the Effective Time, and whether or not Sellers, but for this Section  10.07(c), would be legally liable to the claimant or to a Buyer Indemnitee or otherwise for  such a Liability/Claim or a part thereof.   10.08 _Sellers\' Maximum Liability_ _._ As reflected above, it is the intent of the Parties that Sellers have contractual indemnity obligations only under Sections 10.01 through 10.04 (subject to the limits provided for in this Article X), and that Buyer have contractual indemnity obligations only under Section 10.07 (subject to the limits provided for in this Article X). In no event shall the sum of Sellers\' and Sellers Guarantors\' payments for Expenditures, Liabilities/Claims, and Sellers and Sellers Guarantor\'s costs in defending themselves ("Sellers\' Defense Costs"), including amounts applied toward the Ceiling in Section 10.05(a), exceed Thirty-two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($32,500,000.00) ("Sellers\' Maximum Liability"), exclusive of and without limitation of Sellers\' obligations under Sections 10.01(c) and 10.03 of this Article X and under Sections 6.07(b) and 6.07(d) of the Agreement.   10.09 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_ _._ Other than claims for actual fraud, the right of each Party to seek indemnification (subject to the limitations provided for in this Article X) from the other Party pursuant to this Article X shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of each Party against the other under the Agreement, and subject to the foregoing, it is expressly understood and agreed that, except by virtue of the indemnification provisions set forth herein, none of the Parties are entitled to any non-contractual indemnity, contribution, adjustment, reduction, set-off, damages, injunctions, specific performance, or the like in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby.   10.10 _Limitation_ _._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Agreement, neither Party:   PAGE 30    (a) shall be liable to the other Party for any damages related to or arising in connection with the  Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby other than actual or compensatory damages; it  being agreed that no Party shall be liable to the other for indirect, incidental,  consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages hereunder, including any lost earnings or  profits, losses due to business interruption or diminution in value of the business except to  the extent arising from third Persons; or   (b) shall be entitled to recover more than once for any one Liability/Claim for which full  indemnification is provided hereunder, such as in the case of Liabilities/Claims flowing from  the breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement hereunder.   10.11 [INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]   10.12 _Survival_. Except as set forth below in this Section 10.12, all obligations under the Agreement, including the indemnification obligations hereunder, shall survive the Effective Time; provided that the representations and warranties of Sellers and Buyer contained in Sections 4.01(a), (b), (c) and (d) and 5.01(a), (b), (c), (e), (f) and (g) of the Agreement shall survive the Effective Time indefinitely, but subject to the applicable statute of limitations, and all other representations and warranties of Sellers and Buyer in the Agreement shall survive the Effective Time for two (2) years; provided that any acknowledgments, waivers, or representations given in the Agreement may be asserted as a defense by any Party hereunder at any time in connection with defending a claim or claims asserted by the other Party hereto, or its successors or assigns, with regard to any of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement; and provided further that Buyer\'s indemnity obligations hereunder shall survive the Effective Time indefinitely notwithstanding any otherwise applicable statute of limitation.   10.13 _Indemnification Procedures_.   (a) If a Party to be indemnified under the Agreement (an "Indemnitee") learns of facts that the  Party believes would entitle that Party to indemnification from the other Party (an  "Indemnitor") (including, in the case of Buyer, that would apply toward the Deductible or the  Ceiling applicable to Sellers\' indemnity obligation hereunder or to the Title Deductible), the  Party who has the right of indemnification based upon such facts shall, within sixty (60) days  after the month in which that Party learns of such facts, provide written notice to the other  Party containing reasonable details and any supporting documentation then known to the  notifying Party of the facts upon which the indemnity claim is based. Supplemental written  notices of additional material facts with respect to matters previously noticed will be given  promptly by the Party to be indemnified to the other. Failure to comply with the proper notice  provisions of this Section 10.13 shall result in a waiver of the right of a Party to seek  indemnification or other relief from the other Party or from the Buyer Guarantor or Sellers  Guarantors, as applicable.   (b) The Indemnitor shall have the right, at its option and at its own expense, to be represented by  counsel of its choice and to participate in the defense, negotiation, and/or settlement of any  Liability/Claim for which it is obligated hereunder which results from a Person not affiliated  with the Indemnitor ("Third Person Liability/Claim"). If Indemnitor chooses to acknowledge its  obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee for such Third Person Liability/Claim, Indemnitor may  assume the defense thereof with Indemnitor-selected counsel to which Indemnitee has not  reasonably objected. Should the Indemnitor so elect to assume the defense of a Third Person  Liability/Claim, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for legal expenses  subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof. If the  Indemnitor assumes such defense, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the  defense thereof and to employ counsel (not reasonably objected to by the Indemnitor), at its  own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnitor, it being understood that the  Indemnitor shall control such assumed defense. The Indemnitor shall be liable for the   PAGE 31    reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee for any period during which  the Indemnitor has failed to assume the defense thereof (other than during the period prior to  the time the Indemnitee shall have given notice of the Third Person Liability/Claim as provided  above).   (c) If the Indemnitor so elects to assume the defense of any Third Person Liability/Claim, the  Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in the defense or prosecution thereof. Such  cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the Indemnitor\'s request) the provision to  the Indemnitor of records and information, which are relevant to such Third Person  Liability/Claim, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide  additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the  Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a Third Person Liability/Claim, the Indemnitee  shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third  Person Liability/Claim without the Indemnitor\'s prior written consent (which consent shall not  be unreasonably withheld). If the Indemnitor shall have assumed the defense of a Third Person  Liability/Claim, the Indemnitee shall agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of a  Third Person Liability/Claim which the Indemnitor may recommend and which by its terms  obligates the Indemnitor to pay the full amount of the liability in connection with such Third  Person Liability/Claim, which releases the Indemnitee completely in connection with such Third  Person Liability/Claim and which would not otherwise adversely affect the Indemnitee.   (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not be entitled to assume the defense of  any Third Person Liability/Claim (and shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of  counsel incurred by the Indemnitee in defending such Third Person Liability/Claim) if the Third  Person Liability/Claim seeks an order, injunction, or other equitable relief or relief for  other than money damages against the Indemnitee which the Indemnitee reasonably determines,  after conferring with its outside counsel, cannot be separated from any related claim for money  damages. If such equitable relief or other relief portion of the Third Person Liability/Claim  can be so separated from that for money damages, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to assume the  defense of the portion relating to money damages. The indemnification required by the foregoing  sections shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the course of the  investigation, remediation, or defense, as and when bills are received or loss, liability,  claim, damage or expense is incurred.   ARTICLE XI  _EMPLOYEE MATTERS_    11.01 _Employees_   (a) Buyer may interview and offer employment to any or all of the individuals listed on Schedule 11.01 (the  "Employees"), which offers of employment shall be effective as of the Effective Time. Buyer shall provide  to Sellers a list of all of those Employees it wishes to interview or to make offers of employment  without interviews and shall coordinate interviews with a Sellers-designated representative. Sellers  shall (i) cooperate with Buyer in its attempts to hire such Employees who may be offered employment by  Buyer, (ii) permit Buyer to review the personnel records and such other information concerning such  Employees as Buyer may reasonably request, subject to obtaining any legally required written permission  of any affected Employee and subject to any restrictions imposed by applicable law, and (iii) not  directly or indirectly discourage any Employee from accepting an offer of employment from Buyer. Buyer  shall provide to Sellers a list of those Employees it intends to make offers of employment, which list  shall include the offered salary and location of employment. Sellers shall, and shall cause their  owners and their Affiliates to, continue to employ all Employees through the Effective Time, except for  any Employee who (i) is terminated with the prior written consent of Buyer or (ii) voluntarily resigns.  Buyer shall also provide to Sellers a list of those Employees who have previously accepted Buyer\'s  employment offer on or before seven (7) days prior to the Closing Date. Those Employees accepting   PAGE 32    employment with Buyer effective as of the Effective Date are herein referred to as the "Hired  Employees." Buyer agrees that it will treat the Hired Employees on substantially the same basis as other  similarly situated employees of Buyer. Sellers shall not, and shall cause their owners and their  respective Affiliates to not, solicit the services of any Hired Employee during the one-year period  following the Closing Date.  (b) Buyer will be responsible for any severance pay and severance benefits to the extent required under  federal, state, or local law, or notices required under such laws, with respect to terminations by Buyer  of Hired Employees occurring after the Effective Time. Buyer shall defend, indemnify, and hold Sellers  and their Affiliates harmless from any Liabilities/Claims by any Hired Employee for their wages,  salaries, bonuses, severance pay, and severance benefits provided under federal, state, or local law,  notices required under such laws, and compensation or benefits of any kind which have been earned under  Buyer\'s employee benefit plans as a result of and related to any of the Hired Employees\' employment by  Buyer after the Effective Time.  (c) Sellers or their Affiliates shall retain responsibility for payment of the following matters that have  been earned for the periods prior and up to the Effective Time as a result of the Employees\' employment  with Seller:   (i) wages, salaries and bonuses;   (ii) severance pay and severance benefits to the extent required under federal, state, or local law,  or notices required under such laws, with respect to employees of Sellers who are terminated  prior to the Effective Time; and   (iii) except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article XI, all liability and obligations under  all Employee Benefit Plans, deferred and incentive compensation plans of Sellers or its  Affiliates and all employment-based or related claims and matters.  11.02 _Employee Benefit Plans_.  (a) As of the Effective Time, Sellers or their Affiliates shall cause the termination of the participation  of the Hired Employees in all of the savings, Code section 401(k), pension, retirement, medical, dental,  life insurance, accident and sickness, short-term disability, long-term disability, profit-sharing,  deferred compensation, stock option, vacation, stock bonus, employee stock ownership, bonus, severance,  or other similar plans, programs, agreements, and arrangements, including all employee benefit plans as  defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),  which are maintained by or contributed to by Sellers (the "Plans"), except that the Hired Employees\'  participation in Sellers\' or their Affiliates\' medical and dental plans shall continue through the last  day of the month in which the Effective Time occurs. At the end of the last day of the month prior to  the month in which the Effective Time occurs, the Hired Employees\' participation in Sellers\' or their  Affiliates\' medical and dental plans shall terminate. If the "same desk" rule does not apply to the  Sellers\' or their Affiliates\' tax qualified savings plan, Sellers shall make distribution to the  Employees in accordance with the terms of Sellers\' or their Affiliates\' plan. Sellers and Buyer shall  permit direct rollovers to Buyer\'s plan in cash and participants\' loans for electing participants.  Buyer\'s tax qualified savings plan permits rollovers of outstanding participants\' loans. If such rule  applies, the Parties shall cooperate in determining whether a Plan to Plan transfer of assets from  Sellers\' or their Affiliates\' tax qualified savings plan to Buyer\'s tax qualified savings plan can be  made for the Hired Employees. If it is determined a transfer of assets can be made, the Parties shall  promptly arrange a conference call with their respective record keepers of their Plans and direct the  record keepers to cause a transfer of assets ("TOA"), in a form acceptable to Buyer, and shall establish  a date for the TOA. The Parties shall urge their respective record keepers to conclude the TOA as  quickly as possible, but in any event within nine (9) months after the Parties have agreed to the TOA.  Each Party shall ensure that amendments to its Plan documents necessary to accomplish the TOA are  submitted to its board of directors prior to the TOA and shall provide the other Party with a copy of  any such amendment upon adoption.   PAGE 33   (b) As of the Effective Time, all of the Hired Employees will either be covered or permitted to enroll in  all of Buyer\'s Plans in accordance with the terms and conditions of Buyer\'s plans in effect from time to  time for its similarly situated employees generally.  (c) As of the Effective Time, Buyer shall waive or cause the waiver of waiting periods, pre-existing  condition exclusions, and other limitations on participation otherwise applicable to any Hired Employee  and qualified dependents (who was covered by an employee group health plan of Sellers or their  Affiliates and immediately elects to be covered by the group health plan of Buyer) under or with respect  to all plans maintained by Buyer for such Hired Employees. Buyer shall recognize or cause to be  recognized all claims and expenses of Hired Employees during 2002 for purposes of satisfying applicable  deductible provisions (and any other like adjustments or limitations on coverage) under, and to the  extent recognized for current employees of Buyer, all applicable group health plans maintained by  Buyer. To the extent reasonably required by Buyer, Sellers shall cause Sellers\' or their Affiliates\'  plan providers and insurers to provide to Buyer a true and complete listing of all amounts so expended  (including co-payments and deductibles paid) with respect to each Hired Employee and such other  information as Buyer may reasonably require in order to properly administer the provisions of this  Section 11.02(c).  (d) Without limiting Section 11.01(c)(iii), Sellers shall retain responsibility for all medical, dental,  life, vision, AD and D, cafeteria, short-term disability, and long-term disability claims by any Hired  Employee which were incurred on or prior to the Effective Time and for workers\' compensation claims  related to injuries arising from the employment of the Employees for periods prior to the Effective  Time, in each case to the extent covered by the respective employee benefit plan and/or insurance plan  or policy of Sellers or their Affiliates, and any claims regarding Sellers\' 401(k) Plan which arise out  of the administration or operation of such Plan prior to the Effective Time. Sellers will provide  reasonable assistance, at no cost to Buyer, for the administration or termination of such benefits.  (e) For purposes of this Section 11.02, a claim for reimbursement under a medical, hospital or dental,  prescription drug, or similar plan shall be deemed to be incurred on the date that the claim occurs. A  claim occurs on the date service is provided and there shall be no continuation of a claim from one day  to the next. In the event of a hospitalization commencing on or prior to the last day of the month in  which the Effective Time occurs, any existing coverage shall cease on the end of the last day of the  month in which the Effective Time occurs unless the participant elects COBRA continuation coverage.  (f) To the extent recognized by Sellers, prior employment with Sellers or an Affiliate thereof shall be  recognized by Buyer for the purpose of determining service awards, vacation eligibility, and for  eligibility, vesting, and participation under Buyer\'s employee benefit plans for the Hired Employees but  not with respect to calculating pension benefit payments; provided, however, that vacation time earned  and unused while a Hired Employee was employed by Sellers\' Affiliate shall be paid by the employing  Affiliate to the applicable Hired Employees; and provided further, that Buyer shall allow Hired  Employees to take such accrued and unused vacation on or before the time it would have been required to  be taken under the Hired Employee\'s prior employer\'s policies without pay. Neither the foregoing nor any  other provision of this Article XI constitutes an assumption of any liability by Buyer with respect to  any liability or obligation of Sellers, their owners or an Affiliate thereof to or with respect to any  Hired Employees. Commencing with the anniversary year of their employment with Buyer, Hired Employees  will be given vacation recognizing prior years of service with Sellers or their Affiliates on Buyer\'s  vacation schedule.  (g) Nothing in this Article XI should be construed as requiring Buyer to maintain any employee benefit plan  or prevent Buyer from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan at any time in its sole  discretion. Further, nothing herein shall prevent Buyer from terminating any Hired Employee after the  Effective Time for any reason.  (h) No provision of this Article XI shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Hired Employee  (or any beneficiary or dependent thereof), including without limitation, any right to continued  employment with Buyer for any specified period of time after the Effective Time.   PAGE 34   (i) Sellers and Buyer agree that, with respect to Hired Employees who accept employment with Buyer upon the  Closing, each will take the position that they respectively meet the definitions of "predecessor" and  "successor" as defined in Revenue Procedure 96-60 and IRS Regulation Section 31.3121(a)(1)-1(b). Absent  a mutual agreement to the contrary, Sellers and Buyer will use the "Standard Procedure" described in  Section 4 of Revenue Procedure 96-60. Sellers shall supply to Buyer, with respect to all Hired  Employees, all cumulative payroll information as of the Effective Time that Buyer shall reasonably  request in order to comply with IRS Regulation 31.3121(a)(1)-1(b).   ARTICLE XII  _MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_    12.01 _Commission_. Each of the Parties hereto represents and warrants that there are no claims against such Party for brokerage commissions or finders\' fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Sellers and Buyer will respectively pay or discharge, and will defend (upon the other\'s request) and indemnify the other for brokerage commissions or finders\' fees incurred by reason of any action taken by such indemnifying Party.   12.02 _Assignment_. The terms, provisions, and conditions of this Agreement shall extend to, be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto, their respective successors, and assigns. No Party will make an assignment of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to a Person that is not an Affiliate of such assigning Party without the prior written consent of the other, which such consent may be withheld for any reason; provided, that notwithstanding any contrary provision of law, including Texas statutory law, a merger or consolidation of Sellers or Buyer with or into any other Person (excluding an Affiliate) shall be an assignment for purposes of this Agreement, and provided further, that the assigning Party, as a condition to making an assignment to an Affiliate or to obtaining the consent of the other Party to any non-Affiliate assignment, shall execute and deliver an instrument, in a form reasonably satisfactory to the consenting Party, by which the assigning party expressly agrees to remain bound by and primarily liable under this Agreement. Any assignment or attempted assignment in violation of this Section shall be void.   12.03 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_.

Additionally, Sellers agree to hold in confidence and not disclose all Splitter Asset-related Confidential Information (as that term is defined in such Confidentiality Agreement), except and to the extent required to be disclosed by applicable Legal Requirements (including disclosures necessary or convenient in the winding up of the business related to the Splitter Assets). This Agreement may be amended only by a written instrument duly executed by the Parties. Any condition to a Party\'s obligations hereunder may be waived in writing by such Party.

Each portion of this Agreement is intended to be severable. If any term or provision hereof is illegal or invalid for any reason whatsoever, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this Agreement.   12.05 _Actions_. Each Party agrees that it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all such action as may be necessary for it to consummate the transactions as set forth in this Agreement and to assure that it will not be under any material corporate, legal, or contractual restriction that would prohibit or delay the timely consummation of such transactions.   PAGE 35    12.06 _Termination_.   (a) This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing:   (1) by mutual written consent of Sellers and Buyer;   (2) by Sellers on the Closing if the conditions set forth in Section 8.03 have not been  satisfied by Buyer or waived by Sellers in writing by the Closing;   (3) by Buyer on the Closing if the conditions set forth in Section 8.02 have not been  satisfied by Sellers or waived by Buyer in writing by the Closing;   (4) pursuant to Section 6.01; and   (5) by either Party, if there shall be any final, non-appealable order, writ, injunction  or decree of any Governmental Body binding Sellers or Buyer which prohibits or restrains  Sellers or Buyer from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) If the Closing does not occur as a result of either Sellers or Buyer exercising its right to  terminate pursuant to this Section 12.06, this Agreement shall be null and void, and no Party  shall have any rights or obligations under this Agreement, except that:   (1) All filings, applications and other submissions made to any Governmental Body shall,  to the extent practicable, be withdrawn from the Governmental Body to which they were made;   (2) A termination shall not relieve any Party from any liability for breach hereof  occurring prior to termination, and the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to any and all  relief under applicable law or in equity on account of such breach; and   (3) Buyer\'s indemnification and related obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement  referenced in Section 12.03 shall survive any such termination.   12.07 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.   12.08 _Governing Law_.

(a) All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be served on the Parties at the addresses set forth in Section 12.10(b).

In relation to any dispute resolution, legal action, or proceedings to enforce this Agreement  or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement ("Enforcement Proceedings"), each of the  Parties irrevocably agrees to conduct such proceedings in an appropriate federal or state court  sitting in Houston, Harris County, Texas, and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such  courts and waives any objection to Enforcement Proceedings in such courts on the grounds of  jurisdiction, venue, or on the grounds that the Enforcement Proceedings have been brought in an  inconvenient forum. The prevailing Party in any such Proceedings (specifically excluding the  dispute resolution proceedings described in the following subsection) shall be entitled to  recover its reasonable attorneys\' fees and other fees and expenses from the other Party.   (b) The Parties agree that all claims, controversies, and disputes arising out of or relating to  this Agreement, or to the breach, termination, interpretation, or validity thereof ("Disputes")  shall be handled as follows: The Party initiating the Dispute shall first give written notice  of the Dispute to the other Party. Executives (of each Party) having authority to settle the  Dispute shall then meet and negotiate to resolve the Dispute. If such executives fail to meet  or are unable to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date of the receiving  Party\'s receipt of the notice from the Party initiating the Dispute, the Parties shall endeavor  to settle the dispute by mediation under the Mediation Procedure of the CPR Institute for  Dispute Resolution ("CPR") in effect on the date of this Agreement. The Parties have agreed  that CPR shall select a mediator in any such Dispute, and such person will agree to serve in  that capacity and to be available on reasonable notice. If the foregoing selected individual  is or becomes unwilling or unable to serve, CPR shall appoint another mediator. If neither of  these two selected individuals is able or willing to serve, the Parties will agree on a  substitute with the assistance of CPR. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the Parties will  select a mediator from the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals. Each Party agrees to bear  fifty percent (50%) of the mediation costs, including the fees and expenses of the mediator. If  the Dispute has not been resolved by mediation within sixty (60) days after the mediator has  commenced such mediation, either Party shall be free to file an appropriate action in the  courts identified in the prior subsection with respect to such Dispute.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party shall be free to seek judicial relief in the courts  specified in subsection (a) above, without resort to the dispute resolution procedures of  subsection (b) above, if necessary to prevent immediate or irreparable harm.  12.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. __Nothing in this Agreement shall provide any benefit to any third party or entitle any third party to any claim, cause of action, remedy, or right of any kind, it being the intent of the Parties to this Agreement that this Agreement shall not be construed as a third party beneficiary   PAGE 38    contract; provided, however, that the provisions of Article IX and Article X related to disclaimers and indemnification in this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Buyer Indemnitees and the Sellers Indemnitees as provided therein.  12.13 _Expenses_ _._ Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, and except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such costs or expenses.
