Section 3.1. _Effect on Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Flotek, Acquisition Sub, the Company, or
the Stockholders:

 

(a) The shares of voting common stock of the Company which are issued and

The

 



2  Merger Consideration, as adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.1, shall be

holder pursuant to the Merger) shall be paid in cash (without interest) an
amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Closing Stock Value.

 

Section 3.2. _Net Working Capital Procedures._

(a) The Parties acknowledge that the Merger Consideration is based in part on
the Company having Net Working Capital as of April 30, 2013 (the " _Closing
Balance Sheet Date_ ") in an amount somewhere between $11,500,000 and
$12,500,000. No later than three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare or cause to be prepared and deliver or cause to be
delivered a consolidated balance sheet of the Company Group as of the Closing
Balance Sheet Date, which consolidated balance sheet shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP; _provided_ , _however_ , that, even if inconsistent with
GAAP, such consolidated balance sheet shall not take into account the
Transaction, other than as otherwise provided in Section 3.2(b) and Section
6.2(a) below (such consolidated balance sheet prepared in accordance with this
Section 3.2(a) being referred to as the " _Estimated Closing Date Balance
Sheet_ " and the Net Working Capital shown thereon being referred to as the "
_Estimated Net Working Capital_ ").

(b) The Parties agree that the Net Working Capital as of the Closing Balance
Sheet Date will be reduced by payments made by the Company to satisfy the
Change of Control Payment Obligations identified on Schedule 3.2 attached
hereto, which payments will be treated as having been made by the Company
prior to the Closing for both accounting and tax purposes.

(c) If the Estimated Net Working Capital exceeds $12,500,000, then the Cash
Portion shall be increased by the amount of such excess.

 

(d) If the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than $11,500,000, then the
Cash Portion shall be decreased by an amount equal to the amount by which the
Estimated Net Working Capital is less than $11,500,000.

 



3 (e) Following the Closing, Flotek and its representatives shall have the
reasonable opportunity to examine the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet
and the supporting schedules, analyses, work papers and other underlying
records or documentation as are reasonably necessary and appropriate for
Flotek to confirm or object to the Companys calculation of the Estimated Net
Working Capital shown on the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet. The
Stockholders shall cooperate with Flotek and their representatives in
connection with such examination, including providing answers to questions
asked by Flotek and their representatives. For the purpose of confirming the
Estimated Net Working Capital, Flotek shall prepare or cause to be prepared a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Closing Balance
Sheet Date, which consolidated balance sheet shall be prepared using the same
principles and policies used to prepare the Estimated Closing Date Balance
Sheet in accordance with Section 3.2(a) (such consolidated balance sheet being
referred to as the " _Final Closing Date Balance Sheet_ ").

(f) No later than the date that is three (3) months after the Closing Date,
Flotek shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Stockholders
Representative the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, together with a worksheet
showing the difference, if any, between the Net Working Capital shown on
the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet (the " _Final Net Working Capital_ ")
and the Estimated Net Working Capital shown on the Estimated Closing Date
Balance Sheet. Following the delivery of such Final Closing Date Balance Sheet
and such worksheet to the Company, Flotek shall afford the Stockholders
Representative and his representatives the reasonable opportunity to examine
such Final Closing Date Balance Sheet, such worksheet and such supporting
schedules, analyses, work papers and other underlying records or
documentation that are in Floteks possession or control as are reasonably
necessary and appropriate for the Stockholders Representative to confirm or
object to Floteks calculation of the Final Net Working Capital shown on the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet. Flotek shall cooperate with the
Stockholders Representative and his representatives in connection with such
examination, including providing answers to questions asked by the
Stockholders Representative and its representatives. If, within 45 days after
the date of the delivery to the Company of the Final Closing Date Balance
Sheet, the Stockholders Representative disagrees in good faith with any
item included in the calculation of the Final Net Working Capital shown on
the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet (such disputed items being the "
_Disputed Working Capital Items_ "), then the Stockholders Representative may
give written notice (a " _Working Capital Dispute Notice_ ") to Flotek within
such 45-day period, which Working Capital Dispute Notice shall: (i) set forth
the Stockholders Representatives proposed resolution of the Disputed
Working Capital Items (including the calculation of the Stockholders
Representative of the Final Net Working Capital, taking into account such
proposed resolution of the Disputed Working Capital Items), (ii) specify in
reasonable detail the Stockholders Representatives basis for disagreement
with respect to the Disputed Working Capital Items and (iii) include materials
showing in reasonable detail the Stockholders Representatives support for
such position. Any matters set forth in the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet
that are not included as Disputed Working Capital Items in a timely delivered
Working Capital Dispute Notice shall be deemed accepted by the Stockholders
Representative and shall be final and binding for all purposes under this
Agreement, and (A) the failure by the Stockholders Representative to provide
a Working Capital Dispute Notice within such 45-day period or (B) the delivery
by the Stockholders Representative to Flotek during such 45-day period of a
written notice stating that the Stockholders Representative has elected not
to deliver a Working Capital Dispute Notice, 

 



4  will constitute a full and complete acceptance of the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet as prepared by Flotek, and such Final Closing Date Balance Sheet
shall be final and binding for all purposes under this Agreement. If Flotek
and the Stockholders Representative are unable to resolve any disagreement
between them with respect to the Disputed Working Capital Items within 15 days
after the delivery of a Working Capital Dispute Notice by the Stockholders
Representative to Flotek, then the Disputed Working Capital Items (but no
others) may be referred by the Stockholders Representative or Flotek for
determination to the Independent Accountant. Each of the Stockholders
Representative and Flotek shall provide the Independent Accountant and the
other Party with a statement of its position as to the amount for each
Disputed Working Capital Item (including their respective calculation of the
Final Net Working Capital, taking into account such proposed resolution of
the Disputed Working Capital Items) within 15 days from the date of the
referral of the disagreement to the Independent Accountant. The Independent
Accountant shall make a written determination of the Final Net Working
Capital as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the
date on which the disagreement is referred to the Independent Accountant,
after taking into account the Final Net Working Capital as calculated by the
Stockholders Representative and by Flotek and their respective positions as
to each Disputed Working Capital Item, and such determination shall be final
and binding for all purposes under this Agreement. If at any time
the Stockholders Representative and Flotek resolve their dispute, then
notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Section 3.2(e), the
Independent Accountants involvement promptly shall be discontinued and the
Final Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be revised, if necessary, to reflect
such resolution and thereupon shall be final and binding for all purposes of
this Agreement. Each Party shall make readily available to the Independent
Accountant all relevant Books and Records relating to the Final Closing Date
Balance Sheet and all other items reasonably requested by the Independent
Accountant in connection with resolving the disagreement regarding the
Disputed Working Capital Items. The Stockholders, on one hand jointly and
severally, and Flotek, on the other hand, shall each be responsible for paying
fifty percent (50%) of the costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant.
The decision of the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding for all
purposes of this Agreement and the Final Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be
revised, if necessary, to reflect such decision and thereupon shall be final
and binding for all purposes of this Agreement.

compliance with (i) the obligations and requirements of the FCPA, including
the anti-bribery provisions and the accounting and record-keeping requirements
set forth in the FCPA, (ii) the obligations and requirements of United Kingdom
Bribery Act of 2010, (iii) the principles set out in the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development Convention Combating Bribery of Foreign
Public Officials in International Business Transactions and (iv) all other
similar or equivalent anti-corruption and/or anti-bribery laws of
any jurisdiction applicable to such member of the Company Group (whether by
virtue of such Company Group members jurisdiction of organization or conduct
of its business) (clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) collectively, " _Anti-
Corruption Laws_ "). Each member of the Company Group has instituted and
maintained policies and procedures designed to ensure, and which are
reasonably expected to continue to ensure, compliance with all Anti-Corruption
Laws. 

 



23 (b) No member of the Company Group or any agent, representative, consultant or
other third party acting for or on behalf of any member of the Company Group
has, at any time:

(i) made, directly or indirectly, any payment or promise to pay, or gift or
promise to give or authorized such a promise or gift, of any money or anything
of value, directly or indirectly, (A) to (1) any "foreign official" (as such
term is defined in the FCPA) for the purpose of influencing any official act
or decision of such official or inducing him or her to use his or her
influence to affect any act or decision of a foreign Governmental Authority,
or (2) any foreign political party or official thereof or candidate for
foreign political office for the purpose of influencing any official act or
decision of such party, official or candidate or inducing such party, official
or candidate to use his, her or its influence to affect any act or decision
of a foreign Governmental Authority, in the case of both clauses (1) and (2),

Section 5.29. _Securities Matters._ The Flotek Shares are being or will be
acquired by each Stockholder for his or its own account and with no intention
of distributing or reselling such securities or any part thereof in any
transaction that would be in violation of the securities laws of the United
States of America, or any state, without prejudice, however, to the rights of
the Stockholders at all times to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part
of such securities under an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act, or under an exemption from such registration available under
the Securities Act. Each Stockholder is experienced in evaluating companies
such as Flotek and has such knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of
his or its investment and has the ability to suffer the total loss of his or
its investment. Each Stockholder has had the opportunity to ask questions of
and receive answers from executive officers of Flotek concerning the terms
and conditions of the offering of the shares of Flotek Common Stock and to
obtain additional information to the satisfaction of the Stockholder. Each
Stockholder is an "accredited investor" as that term is defined by Rule 501
of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Each Stockholder
understands that the Flotek Shares will not be registered at the time of their
issuance under the Securities Act for the reason that the sale provided for
in this Agreement is exempt pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and
that the reliance of Flotek on such exemption is predicated in part on the
representations set forth herein. No Stockholder will sell or assign any
Flotek Shares except pursuant to a valid registration statement filed pursuant
to the Securities Act or pursuant to a valid exemption from the registration
requirements thereof.

 



24 Section 5.30. _Disclosure_. No representation or warranty made by the Company

material fact, or omits to state a material fact necessary to make such
representation or warranty, in light of the circumstances in which it is made,
not misleading.

Section 7.2. _Indemnification by the Stockholders_. Subject to the limitations
set forth in Sections 7.6, 7.7 and 7.8 below, each Stockholder shall jointly
and severally (except as otherwise provided in Section 7.7(d) below) indemnify
Flotek and Acquisition Sub, and their respective Affiliates (including their
respective officers, directors, employees and agents) (a " _Flotek
Indemnified Party_ ") against, and hold each of them harmless from and
against, any Damages suffered, paid, or incurred by the indemnified Party as a
result of (a) any inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations and
warranties made by or on behalf of the Company or the Stockholders in Article

28  Flotek and Acquisition Sub in Article IV of this Agreement (in each case
without regard to any qualification as to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect), and/or (b) any violation or breach by Acquisition Sub or Flotek of
or default by Acquisition Sub or Flotek under the terms of this Agreement.

Section 7.4.  _Procedure_.

(a) Promptly after receipt by a person entitled to indemnity under this
Article VII (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") of notice of the assertion of a
claim by a non-party hereto (" _Third-Party Claim_ ") against it, such
Indemnified Person shall give notice to the Person or Persons obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Person under this Article VII (whether one or more,
an " _Indemnifying Person_ ") of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim;
provided, however, that the failure to so promptly notify the Indemnifying
Person of such Third-Party Claim will not relieve such Party from any
Liability which it may have under this Article VII except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the Indemnifying Person.

 

(b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant
to Section 7.4(a) hereof of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Third-Party Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless the Indemnifying
Person is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the
Indemnified Person determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim. After the
Indemnifying Person provides notice to the Indemnified Person of the
Indemnifying Persons election to assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it diligently conducts
such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this Article VII for
any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the defense
of such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Person assumes the defense of a
Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption shall not be deemed consent by the
Indemnifying Person that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within
the scope of and subject to indemnification, and (ii) no compromise or
settlement of such Third-Party Claim may be effected by the Indemnifying
Person without the Indemnified Persons written consent (which consent may
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (A) there is no
finding or admission of any violation of any legal requirement or any
violation of the rights of any person; (B) the sole relief provided
is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person; and (C)
the Indemnified Person shall have no liability with respect to any compromise
or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its written consent.
If notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any Third-
Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person does not, within ten (10) business
days after the Indemnified Persons notice is given, give notice to the
Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Person shall defend the Third Party Claim, but any
settlement of such claim will require the consent of the Indemnifying Person,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this Article VII: (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying
Person, as the case may be, shall keep the other Party fully informed of the
status of such Third-Party Claim and any related proceedings at all stages
thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the
Parties agree (each at its own expense) to render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in
good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any Third-Party Claim.

 



29 (d) If the Indemnifying Person is responsible for the attorneys fees of
the Indemnified Person and there is more than one Indemnified Person with
respect to the Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Persons shall retain
only one law firm to represent them with respect to such claim unless there
is, under applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any
significant issue between the positions of any two or more of such Indemnified
Persons.

(e) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under
this Article VII, the Parties agree to cooperate in such a manner as to
preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all
confidential information of each Party and the attorney-client and work-
product privileges. In connection therewith, each Party agrees that: (i) such
Party will use its commercially reasonable best efforts, in respect of any
Third-Party Claim in which it has assumed or participated in the defense, to
avoid production of confidential information of the other Party (consistent
with applicable law and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications
between any Party and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense
of any Third-Party Claim shall, to the extent possible, be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege.

 

Section 7.5. _Escrow_. The following terms shall apply to the Escrow Amount:

 

(i) If, prior to final release of the Escrow Amount to the Stockholder, the
Stockholders become finally obligated to make payments in respect of any
Damages pursuant to this Article VII and such obligation is not in dispute,
then, subject to the provisions of this Section 7.5, Flotek and the
Stockholders Representative shall promptly (but in any event within five
Business Days of such obligation arising (or, if later, ceasing to be in
dispute)) issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the
Escrow Agent to release the amount pursuant to such obligation (up to a
maximum amount equal to the Escrow Amount then on deposit in the Escrow
Account) from the Escrow Account to the Flotek Indemnified Party within three
(3) Business Days of receipt of such joint written instructions.

 

(ii) To the extent the Stockholders are obligated to make payments in respect
of any Damages pursuant to this Article VII, such Damages shall be satisfied
first by the release to the Flotek Indemnified Party from the Escrow Account
of the amount payable by the Stockholders, fifty percent (50%) in cash and
fifty percent (50%) in Flotek Shares, with Flotek Shares valued for such
purpose at the Closing Stock Value. To the extent the Escrow Amount then on
deposit in the Escrow Account is insufficient to fully satisfy any such
Indemnified Amount, then, subject to the provisions of this Section 7.5,
any remaining payments that the Stockholders are obligated to make shall be
payable directly by the Stockholders pursuant to Section 7.2.

(iii) On the Escrow Interim Release Date, Flotek and the Stockholders
Representative shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release to the Stockholders from the Escrow
Account within three Business Days of receipt of such joint written
instructions $5,000,000 _minus_ (A) the amount, if any, of such

 



30  Escrow Amount that the Escrow Agent has released in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement as of such date, (B) the amount, if any, of
such Escrow Amount that the Escrow Agent has been instructed to release in
accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement but has not actually
released as of such date and (C) if any Flotek Indemnified Party has on or
prior to such date asserted in good faith a Claim with respect to any
Damages, a reasonable reserve amount (as determined by Flotek). Any amounts
released pursuant to this Section 7.5(iii) shall be released in the form of
50% cash (among the Stockholders pro rata in proportion to the total amount
of cash to be received by each of them under Section 3.1(a) above) and 50%
Flotek Shares (among the Stockholders pro rata in proportion to the total
number of Flotek Shares to be received by each of them under Section 3.1(a)
above), based on a valuation of the Flotek Shares at the Closing Stock Value.

(iv) On the Escrow Final Release Date, Flotek and the Stockholders
Representative shall issue joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to release to the Stockholders from the Escrow
Account within three Business Days of receipt of such joint written
instructions (A) the Escrow Amount then on deposit in the Escrow Account, if
any, _minus_ (B)(1) the amount, if any, of such Escrow Amount that the Escrow
Agent has been instructed to release in accordance with this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement but has not actually released as of such date and (2) if any
Flotek Indemnified Party has on or prior to such date asserted in good faith a
Claim with respect to any Damages, a reasonable reserve amount (as determined
by Flotek). The cash to be released under this Section 7.5(iv) shall be
distributed among the Stockholders pro rata in proportion to the total amount
of cash to be received by each of them under Section 3.1(a) above) and the
Flotek Shares to be released under this Section 7.5(iv) shall be distributed
among the Stockholders pro rata in proportion to the total number of Flotek
Shares to be received by each of them under Section 3.1(a) above).

 

(v) Following resolution from time to time of any Claim for which a reserve of
a portion of the Escrow Amount then on deposit was established as described
in Sections 7.5(e)(iii), Flotek and the Stockholders Representative shall
execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent joint written instructions instructing
the Escrow Agent to release such reserve amount from the Escrow Account to
the Stockholders, the Flotek Indemnified Parties, or both, as appropriate for
the resolution of such Claim within three Business Days of receipt of such
joint written instructions.

 

(vi) If Flotek or the Stockholders Representative shall fail to timely
execute and deliver joint written instructions when required hereunder, the
Stockholders Representative or Flotek, respectively, shall be entitled to
seek an order, judgment or decision that will enable the Escrow Agent to
distribute to the Stockholders or the Flotek Indemnified Party,
as applicable, the Escrow Amount to which it is entitled and to seek Damages
from Flotek or the Stockholders, as applicable, as a result of such failure to
comply herewith.

Section 7.6. _Express Negligence; Indemnification_. The indemnification
obligations under this Article VII shall apply regardless of whether any suit
or action results solely or in part from the active, passive or concurrent
negligence of the indemnified Party. The rights of the Parties to
indemnification under this Article VII shall not be limited due to any
investigations heretofore or hereafter made by such Parties or
their representatives, regardless of negligence in the conduct of any such
investigations. The representations, warranties and covenants and agreements
made by the Parties shall not be deemed merged into any instruments or
agreements delivered in connection with the Closing or otherwise in

31 Section 7.7. _Limitations on Liability_.

 

(a) The Company and the Stockholders will have no liability under Section
7.2(a) and Section 7.2(e) until the aggregate amount of all Damages with
respect to matters covered by such Sections exceeds $600,000 (the "
_Deductible_ "), in which case the Company and the Stockholders shall be
liable only for Damages in excess of the Deductible.

 

(b) The maximum amount of Damages that Flotek and the Acquisition Sub will be
entitled to recover from the Company and the Stockholders pursuant to Section
7.2(a) and Section 7.2(e) shall equal $20,000,000 (the " _Cap_ ").

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, neither the Deductible
nor the Cap shall apply to or limit any recovery for any Damages arising from
a breach of Section 5.1, Section 5.2, Section 5.3, Section 5.4 or 5.9(a),
or any claim arising from actual fraud, provided that the maximum aggregate
amount of Damages that Flotek and the Acquisition Sub will be entitled to
recover from the Stockholders pursuant to Section 7.2(a) for any Damages
arising from a breach of Section 5.1, Section 5.2, Section 5.3 or Section
5.4, shall be limited to $99,500,000.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to
the extent this Agreement provides that any liability or obligation of the
Stockholders is to be joint and several, such provision shall not apply to
either of the Snively Trusts and, instead the liability of the Snively Trusts
shall be only joint and several with respect to each other, and several with
respect to the other Stockholders in proportion to their respective
Proportionate Ownership. For example, if the Stockholders are liable for
Damages in the amount of $1,000,000 under this Agreement, then the liability
of the Snively Trusts will be limited to $100,000 in the aggregate (10% of
$1,000,000),with each such Snively Trust being jointly and severally liable
for such amount.

Section 7.8. _Exclusive Remedy._ No Party shall have any liability, and no
Party shall make any claim, for any Liability or other matter (and each of
the Parties hereby waives any right of contribution against the other and
their respective Affiliates), under, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any other document, agreement, certificate or other matter
delivered pursuant hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby, whether
based on contract, tort, strict liability, other Laws or otherwise, except as
provided in this Article VII or for any remedy available to the Acquisition
Sub for fraud or willful misconduct.

as they deem reasonably necessary and shall discuss the problem and negotiate
in good faith in an effort to resolve the Dispute without the necessity of any
formal proceeding. In addition, to facilitate such negotiations, the Parties
may agree to utilize the services of a mediator whose fees shall be split
equally by Flotek and the Stockholders.

 

(ii) The Parties agree that any written statements, including the Dispute
Notice and the Dispute Response, will be prepared in connection with
settlement negotiations, and as such will be privileged and shall not be used
against the Party who prepared such statement unless it is subsequently
introduced by the preparing Party in any formal proceedings. The Parties also
agree that the informal settlement negotiations will be conducted privately,
amicably and confidentially.

(iii) Should the Representatives fail to reach agreement within 30 days after
receipt of the Dispute Notice in accordance with Section 9.11(a)(i) (or such
longer period as such Representatives may agree in writing), then formal
proceedings for the resolution of such Dispute may be commenced in accordance
with the remainder of this Section 9.11.

 



42 (iv) This Section 9.11 will not be construed to prevent the Parties from
instituting, and the Parties are authorized to institute, formal proceedings
(including seeking provisional remedies such as attachment, temporary
restraining order, preliminary injunction and replevin from the appropriate
court) earlier to avoid the expiration of any applicable limitations period,
to avoid irreparable harm, to preserve a superior position with respect to
other creditors, or, to pursue injunctive or other equitable remedies.

 

(b) Arbitration. If the Parties are unable to resolve any Dispute arising
under this Agreement as contemplated by Section 9.11(a), then (subject to the
exceptions referred to in Section 9.11(a)(iv)) such Dispute shall be submitted
to mandatory and binding arbitration at the election of either Flotek or the
Stockholders Representative (the " _Disputing Party_ ") pursuant to the
following conditions:

(i) Procedures. The arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to (i) the
Federal Arbitration Act with the arbitrator(s) selected pursuant to the
procedures set forth in Section 9.11(b)(ii)(B) or Section 9.11(b)(ii)(C) below
(the " _Arbitrator(s)_ "), and (ii) the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, as they may be amended from time to time,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 9.11 (the " _AAA Rules_
"). In resolving the substance of the Dispute, the Arbitrator(s) shall apply
substantive Florida law or applicable substantive federal law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no aspect of the Florida Arbitration Act shall be applied to
the arbitration proceeding.

 

(ii) Selection of Arbitrator(s).

(A) The Disputing Party shall notify the other Parties that it is submitting
the Dispute to final and binding arbitration to be conducted privately and
confidentially in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.11.

(B) If the amount in dispute is less than $1,000,000, then such Dispute shall
be resolved by a single Arbitrator mutually acceptable to Flotek and the
Stockholders Representative. If the Parties are unable to agree upon a
mutually acceptable Arbitrator within 30 days of the submission of the Dispute
to arbitration, such Arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the AAA
Rules.

(C) If the amount in dispute is $1,000,000 or more, then, within 30 days
after the notice of initiation of the arbitration procedure, the Flotek
Representative and the Stockholders Representative shall each nominate one
Arbitrator, who must be neutral. If either the Flotek Representative or the
Stockholders Representative fails or refuses to timely nominate an
Arbitrator, such Arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the AAA
Rules. Upon selection of the two Arbitrators by the Flotek Representative and
the Stockholders Representative, the two Arbitrators shall select a third
Arbitrator within 15 days after their appointment, failing agreement on which
such third Arbitrator shall be appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules. The
Arbitrators, acting by

 



43  majority vote, shall resolve all Disputes between the Parties. If one of the
Party-appointed Arbitrators refuses to participate in the proceedings or
refuses to vote, the unanimous decision of the other two Arbitrators shall be
binding.

(iii) _Replacement of Arbitrator_. Should any Arbitrator refuse or be
unable to proceed with arbitration proceedings as called for by this Section
9.11(b), such Arbitrator shall be replaced in the same manner by which he or
she was appointed ( _e.g._ , if a Party appointed the departing Arbitrator,
that Party would appoint his or her replacement, and if the two Party-
appointed Arbitrators appointed the departing Arbitrator, then they would
appoint his or her replacement).

(iv) Place of Arbitration. The arbitration shall be held in Atlanta, Georgia
in the office of the American Arbitration Association or such other location
as may be agreed upon by Flotek and the Stockholders Representative.

(v) Conduct of Arbitration. Upon the service of an arbitration demand, the
Flotek Representative and the Stockholders Representative shall discuss and
attempt to agree upon the manner, timing and extent of discovery that may be
conducted prior to and in preparation for the arbitration hearing. In the
event Flotek and the Stockholders Representative are unable to agree upon
the manner, timing and extent of discovery, such issues shall be submitted to
the Arbitrator(s) for resolution. However, under no circumstances shall the
Arbitrator(s) allow more depositions, interrogatories, requests for
production of documents and requests for admission than permitted by the
presumptive limitations set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2). The
Arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to impose appropriate sanctions,
including an award of reasonable attorneys fees, against any Party that fails
to cooperate in good faith in discovery permitted by this Section 9.11(b)(v)
or ordered by the Arbitrator(s). If the amount in dispute is less
than $1,000,000, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the arbitration
hearing shall be conducted no later than 150 days after the selection of the
Arbitrator in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 9.11(b)(ii).
If the amount in dispute is $1,000,000 or more, the arbitration hearing shall
be conducted at such time as the Parties have completed the discovery
permitted by this Section 9.11(b)(v) and as determined by the Arbitrators.
Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the arbitration hearing shall be
conducted on consecutive days. There shall be no transcript of the arbitration
hearing. The Arbitrator(s) must give effect to legal privileges including the
attorney-client privilege and the work-product immunity.

(vi) Arbitration Award. The Arbitrator(s) shall render a binding decision
within 20 days after the completion of the arbitration hearing. The award of
the Arbitrator(s) shall be reasoned and in writing. The Arbitrator(s) must
certify in the award that such award conforms to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement ( _e.g._ , the award must comply with the parameters
set forth in Article IX of this Agreement). The award rendered by the
Arbitrator(s) shall be conclusive, and judgment on the award may be entered in
any court having jurisdiction.

 

(vii) Binding Nature of the Arbitration Award. The arbitration award shall be
binding on the Parties, and judgment thereon may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction, and may not be appealed except to the extent permitted
by the Federal Arbitration Act.

 



44 (viii) Time of the Essence. The Arbitrator(s) are instructed that time is of
the essence in the arbitration proceeding, and that the Arbitrator(s) shall
have the right and authority to issue reasonable monetary sanctions against
any of the Parties if, upon a showing of good cause, that Party is
unreasonably delaying the proceeding. The amount of such sanction shall be
related to the additional harm, if any, caused by the delay.

(ix) Expenses. The Arbitrator(s) shall have the authority to assess the costs
and expenses of the arbitration proceeding (including the Arbitrator(s) fees
and expenses) against any or all of the Parties. The Arbitrator(s) shall also
have the authority to award attorneys fees and expenses to the prevailing
Party.

(x) Confidentiality. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitration
proceedings and award shall be maintained in confidence by the Parties.

(xi) _Severability_. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any
provision of this Section 9.11 is invalid or unenforceable, then the
invalidity or unenforceability of that provision shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of any other provision of this Section 9.11 and all other
provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

(xii) _Acknowledgement_. THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN ENTERING INTO
THIS SECTION 9.11 THEY ARE KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVING THEIR RIGHT TO A
JURY TRIAL.
