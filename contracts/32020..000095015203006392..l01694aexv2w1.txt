                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


      This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement"), dated as of June
25, 2003, is made and entered into by and among The Elder-Beerman Stores
CORP., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), Wright Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and Wright Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Sub").

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined that it is
advisable and in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to
consummate and has recommended approval by the shareholders of the Company of
the business combination transaction provided for herein in which Sub would
merge with and into the Company and the Company would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (the "Merger");

      WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Sub have each determined
that it is advisable and in the best interests of their respective companies and
shareholders to consummate, and have approved, the Merger;

      WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger;

      WHEREAS, certain executives of the Company will enter into letter
agreements with Parent (the "Management Letters") pursuant to which such persons
will agree to execute, immediately prior to the Effective Time, certain
agreements which will provide for, among other things, the transfer of Company
Common Shares held by such executives for equity in Parent and the assumption by
Parent of certain unexercised options to purchase Company Common Shares held by
such executives, whereby such executives shall be entitled to acquire, by virtue
of the Merger, common stock of Parent upon exercise of such assumed options;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements
set forth in this Agreement, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE I

                                   THE MERGER

      1.01 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, Sub shall be merged with and into the Company
in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Ohio (the
"OGCL"). At the Effective Time, the separate existence of Sub shall cease and
the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Sub and the
Company are sometimes referred to herein as the "Constituent


                                       1
<PAGE>
Corporations." As a result of the Merger, the outstanding shares of capital
stock and the treasury shares of the Constituent Corporations shall be converted
or cancelled in the manner provided in Article II.

      1.02 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the
transactions herein contemplated shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section
8.01, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver (where applicable) of the
conditions set forth in Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing")
will take place at the offices of Thompson Hine LLP, 2000 Courthouse Plaza,
N.E., Dayton, Ohio 45402 at 10:00 a.m., local time, on the seventh calendar day
following satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that, by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) (or, if such day is
not a business day, on the next succeeding business day), unless another date,
time or place is agreed to by the parties hereto (the "Closing Date"). At the
Closing there shall be delivered to Parent, Sub and the Company the certificates
and other documents and instruments required to be delivered under Article VII.

      1.03 Effective Time. At the Closing, a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger") shall be duly prepared and executed by the Constituent
Corporations and thereafter delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of
Ohio (the "Secretary of State") for filing, as provided in Section 1701.81 of
the OGCL, on the Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective at the time of
the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State (the date
and time of such filing being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

      1.04 Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of the Surviving
Corporation. At the Effective Time, (i) the articles of incorporation of Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended so that the
name of Sub shall be changed to The Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. and, as so
amended, such articles of incorporation shall be the articles of incorporation
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and
such articles of incorporation, and (ii) the code of regulations of Sub as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the code of regulations
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law, the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such code of
regulations.

      1.05 Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation. The directors
and officers of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and
after the Effective Time, be the directors and officers, respectively, of the
Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Surviving Corporation's articles of incorporation and code
of regulations.

      1.06  Effects of the Merger.  Subject to the foregoing, the effects of
the Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the OGCL.

      1.07 Further Assurances. Each party hereto will, either prior to or after
the Effective Time, execute such further documents, instruments, deeds, bills of
sale, assignments and assurances and take such further actions as may reasonably
be requested by one or more of the others to consummate the Merger, to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all assets,


                                       2
<PAGE>
properties, privileges, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either
of the Constituent Corporations or to effect the other purposes of this
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE II

                              CONVERSION OF SHARES

      2.01  Conversion of Capital Shares.  At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof:

      (a) Conversion of Sub Common Shares. Each issued and outstanding common
share, without par value, of Sub ("Sub Common Shares") shall be converted into
and become one fully paid and non-assessable common share, without par value, of
the Surviving Corporation ("Surviving Corporation Common Shares"). Each
certificate representing outstanding Sub Common Shares shall as the Effective
Time represent an equal number of Surviving Corporation Common Shares.

      (b) Cancellation of Treasury Shares and Shares Owned by Parent and
Subsidiaries. All common shares, without par value, of the Company ("Company
Common Shares") that are owned by the Company as treasury shares and any Company
Common Shares owned by Parent, Sub or any other wholly-owned Subsidiary of
Parent shall be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist and no stock of
Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

      (c)   Conversion Ratio for Company Common Shares.

            (i) Each issued and outstanding Company Common Share (other than
      shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and other than
      Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.01(d))) shall be converted into
      the right to receive $6.00 in cash, without any interest thereon (the
      "Merger Price"), subject to appropriate adjustment for any stock dividend,
      subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or
      exchange with respect to the Company Common Shares occurring before the
      Effective Time.

            (ii) All Company Common Shares converted in accordance with
      paragraph (i) of this Section 2.01(c) shall no longer be outstanding and
      shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
      each holder of a certificate representing any such shares shall cease to
      have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
      Merger Price per share, upon the surrender of such certificate in
      accordance with Section 2.02, without any interest thereon, subject to any
      applicable withholding tax.

      (d)   Dissenting Shares.

            (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
      outstanding Company Common Share that is held of record by a holder who
      has properly exercised dissenters' rights with respect thereto under
      Section 1701.85 of the OGCL (a "Dissenting Share"), shall not be converted
      into or represent the right to receive the Merger Price pursuant to
      Section 2.01(c), but the holder thereof shall be entitled to


                                       3
<PAGE>
      receive such payment of the fair cash value of such Company Common Share
      from the Surviving Corporation as shall be determined pursuant to Section
      1701.85 of the OGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall have
      failed to perfect or shall withdraw or lose such holder's rights under
      Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, each such holder's Company Common Shares
      shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time
      into the right to receive the Merger Price, without any interest thereon,
      pursuant to Section 2.01(c).

            (ii) The Company shall give Parent (x) prompt notice of any written
      demands for payment of the fair cash value of shares, withdrawals of such
      demands and any other instruments delivered pursuant to Section 1701.85 of
      the OGCL and (y) the opportunity to jointly participate with the Company
      in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for payment
      under Section 1701.85 the OGCL. The Company will not voluntarily make any
      payment with respect to any demands delivered to the Company pursuant to
      Section 1701.85 of the OGCL and will not, except with the prior written
      consent of Parent, settle or offer to settle any such demands.

      (e)   Company Stock Option Plan.

            (i) Subject to paragraph (ii) below and to the terms of the
      Management Letters, immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
      outstanding option to acquire Company Common Shares ("Company Options")
      granted under The Elder-Beerman Stores Corp. Equity and Performance
      Incentive Plan (the "Company Option Plan"), whether or not then
      exercisable, shall be cancelled by the Company, and in consideration of
      such cancellation, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive from
      the Company at the Effective Time an amount in respect thereof equal to
      the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Price per share over
      the per share exercise price thereof and (B) the number of Company Common
      Shares subject thereto (the "Option Amount") (such payment to be net of
      applicable withholding taxes). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
      shall deposit in a bank account an amount of cash equal to the Option
      Amount for each Company Option then outstanding (subject to any applicable
      withholding tax), together with instructions that such cash be promptly
      distributed following the Effective Time to the holders of such Company
      Options in accordance with this Section 2.01(e). From and after the
      Effective Time, other than as expressly set forth in this Section 2.01(e),
      no holder of an Option shall have any other rights in respect thereof
      other than to receive payment, if any, for his or her Options as set forth
      in this Section 2.01(e).

            (ii) Except as provided herein or as otherwise agreed by the
      parties, the Company shall take all actions prior to or as of the Closing
      Date to the effect that the Company Option Plan and any other plan,
      program or arrangement with any current or former employee, officer,
      director or consultant providing for the issuance or grant of any interest
      in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall terminate as of the
      Effective Time. The Company shall exercise reasonable best efforts to
      ensure that following the Effective Time no current or former employee,
      officer, director or consultant shall have any option to acquire any
      Company Common Shares or any other equity interest in the Company under
      the Company Option Plan or any other plan, program or arrangement
      maintained by the Company.


                                       4
<PAGE>
            (iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the
      Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company
      Option Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such actions as are
      necessary to carry out the terms of Section 2.01(e)(i), subject, if
      necessary, to obtaining consents of the holders of Company Options to the
      cancellation thereof in exchange for the consideration set forth in
      Section 2.01(e)(i).

      2.02  Exchange of Certificates.

      (a) Payment Agent. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with a bank or
trust company designated before the Closing Date by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Payment Agent"), a cash amount equal to the
aggregate Merger Price to which holders of Company Common Shares shall be
entitled upon consummation of the Merger, to be held for the benefit of and
distributed to such holders in accordance with this Section 2.02. The Payment
Agent shall agree to hold such funds (such funds, together with earnings
thereon, being referred to herein as the "Payment Fund") for delivery as
contemplated by this Section 2.02 and upon such additional terms as may be
agreed upon by the Payment Agent, the Company and Parent. If for any reason
(including losses) the Payment Fund is inadequate to pay the cash amounts to
which holders of Company Common Shares shall be entitled, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall in any event remain liable, and shall make available
to the Payment Agent additional funds, for the payment thereof. All earnings in
the Payment Fund in excess of the aggregate Merger Price are the property of
Parent and shall be disbursed to Parent promptly upon termination of the Payment
Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose except as expressly
provided in this Agreement.

      (b) Exchange Procedures. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail
to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Company Common Shares (the
"Certificates") whose shares are converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c) into the
right to receive the Merger Price (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Payment
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Surviving
Corporation may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Price. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Payment Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with its
terms, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a check representing the Merger Price per Company Common Share
represented thereby, subject to any applicable withholding tax, which such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II,
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In no event
shall the holder of any Certificate be entitled to receive interest on any funds
to be received in the Merger, including any interest accrued in respect of the
Payment Fund. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Shares
which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Price
may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing such Company
Common Shares is presented to the Payment Agent accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be


                                       5
<PAGE>
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Price per Company Common Share
represented thereby as contemplated by this Article II, together with the
dividends, if any, which may have been declared by the Company on the Company
Common Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all
fees and expenses of the Payment Agent in connection with the distribution of
the Merger Price.

      (c) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
Merger Consideration due to such Person as provided in Section 2.02(b).

      (d) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Shares. All cash paid
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Company Common Shares represented thereby, subject, however,
to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends which may have
been declared by the Company on such shares of Company Common Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and which remained unpaid at the
Effective Time. Unless otherwise required by Section 1701.85 of the OGCL, from
and after the Effective Time, the share transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Shares which
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates (other than Certificates representing Dissenting
Shares) are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.02.

      (e) Termination of Payment Fund. Any portion of the Payment Fund which
remains undistributed to the shareholders of the Company for six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon
demand, and any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) as general
creditors for payment of their claim for the Merger Price per Company Common
Share. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder of Company Common Shares for cash representing the Merger Price delivered
to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

      (f) Withholding Rights. Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder of Company Common Shares such amounts as Parent is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable provision of state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

                                   ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

      The Company represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as of the date of
this Agreement as follows:

      3.01 Organization and Qualification. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation and has full
corporate power and authority to conduct its business as and to the extent now
conducted and to own, use and lease its assets and properties. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified, licensed or admitted to do
business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the ownership,
use or leasing of its assets and properties, or the conduct or nature of its
business, makes such qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for
such failures to be so qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing
which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. Section 3.01 of the letter dated the date hereof and delivered to Parent
and Sub by the Company concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter") sets forth (i) the name and
jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary of the Company, (ii) the
authorized capital shares of each such Subsidiary, (iii) the number of issued
and outstanding capital shares of each such Subsidiary, and (iv) the record
owners of all such shares. Except for interests in the Subsidiaries of the
Company as set forth in Section 3.01 of the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in,
or any interest convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity
or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture or other business association or entity. The Company has
previously delivered or made available to Parent complete and correct copies of
the certificates or articles of incorporation and code of regulations or bylaws
(or other comparable charter documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

      3.02  Capitalization.

      (a) The authorized capital shares of the Company consists solely of
25,000,000 Company Common Shares and 5,000,000 preferred shares, without par

Common Shares were issued and outstanding and no shares were held in the
treasury of the Company. As of June 12, 2003, the Company had authorized for
issuance 2,750,000 Company Common Shares pursuant to the Company Option Plan,
and awards relating to 1,746,297 Company Common Shares have been issued of which
the number of awards relating to Company Common Shares with an exercise price
less than the Merger Price is set forth in Section 3.02 of the Company
Disclosure Letter. As of the date hereof, no Company Preferred Shares are issued
and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding Company Common Shares are,
and all shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the Company Option Plan will be
upon issuance in accordance with the terms specified in the Company Option Plan
and the agreements pursuant to which they are issuable, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Except pursuant to this Agreement and the
Rights Agreement, dated as of November 30, 1997 and as amended as of November
11, 1998, by and between the Company and Norwest Bank Minnesota, N.A., as rights

of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no outstanding subscriptions,
options, warrants, rights (including "phantom" stock rights), preemptive rights
or other contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements, including any
right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security, instrument or
agreement (together, "Options"), obligating the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to issue or sell any capital shares of the Company or to grant,
extend or enter into any Option with respect thereto.

      (b) Except as set forth in Section 3.02 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
all of the outstanding capital shares of each Subsidiary of the Company are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and are owned,
beneficially and of record, by the Company or a Subsidiary wholly-owned,
directly or indirectly, by the Company, free and clear of any liens, claims,
mortgages, encumbrances, pledges, security interests, equities and charges of
any kind (each a "Lien"). Except as set forth in Section 3.02 of the Company
Disclosure Letter, there are no (i) outstanding Options obligating the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any capital shares of any Subsidiary
of the Company or agreements to grant, extend or enter into any such Option or
(ii) voting trusts, proxies or other commitments, understandings, restrictions
or arrangements in favor of any Person other than the Company or a Subsidiary
wholly-owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company with respect to the voting
of or the right to participate in dividends or other earnings on any capital
shares of any Subsidiary of the Company.

      (c) Except as set forth in Section 3.02 of the Company Disclosure Letter,
there are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company or any
Subsidiary of the Company to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company
Common Shares or any capital shares of any Subsidiary of the Company or to
provide funds to, or make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of the Company or any other
Person.

Company Shareholders' Approval. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its
terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of

Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses only in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice.

contingent, fixed or otherwise, or whether due or to become due) of any nature,
except liabilities (i) which were incurred in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, (ii) which have been disclosed in Section 3.07 of

3.08 of the Company Disclosure Letter, (i) there are no actions, suits,
arbitrations or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against, relating to or affecting, nor to the knowledge of the
Company are there any Governmental or Regulatory Authority investigations or
audits pending or threatened against, relating to or affecting, the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets and properties which,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or
on the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is
subject to any order of any Governmental or Regulatory Authority which,

this Agreement.

      3.09 Information Supplied. None of (a) the proxy statement relating to the
Company Shareholders' Meeting, as amended or supplemented from time to time (as
so amended and supplemented, the "Proxy Statement"), and any other documents to
be filed by the Company with the SEC or any other Governmental or Regulatory
Authority in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby or (b) information supplied by the Company in writing for inclusion in
the Schedule 13E-3 will, on the date of its filing or, in the case of the Proxy
Statement, at the date it is mailed to shareholders of the Company and at the
time of the Company Shareholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading or necessary to

become false or misleading, except that no representation is made by the Company
with respect to information supplied in writing by or on behalf of Parent or Sub
expressly for inclusion therein and information incorporated by reference

The Proxy Statement filed by the Company with the SEC under the Exchange Act
relating to the Company Shareholders' Meeting will comply as to form in all
material respects with the Exchange Act.

      3.10 Permits; Compliance with Laws and Orders. The Company and its
Subsidiaries hold all permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and
approvals of all Governmental and Regulatory Authorities necessary for the
lawful conduct of their respective businesses (the "Company Permits"), except
for failures to hold such permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders and
approvals which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. The Company, its Subsidiaries, the Owned Real Property and the
Company Store Leases are in compliance with the terms of the Company Permits,
except for failures so to comply which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company and its
Subsidiaries are not in violation of or default under any Law or Order of any
Governmental or Regulatory Authority, except for such violations or defaults

whole.

      3.11  Compliance with Agreements; Certain Agreements.

material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
All such Contracts are in full force and effect, except to the extent they have
previously expired in accordance with their terms, or except where such
invalidity or unenforceability would not reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

hereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, other

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

of 1,000 common shares, without par value, all of which shares are validly
issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by Parent
free and clear of any and all Liens. On the date hereof Sub has, and at all
times through the Effective Time, Sub will continue to have, no obligations or
liabilities (whether absolute, accrued, contingent, fixed or otherwise, or
whether due or to become due) of any nature except for nominal liabilities
associated with Sub's organization and liabilities arising under or in
connection with this Agreement.

      4.07 Financing. Parent has, or has received binding (subject to the terms

                                       24

has provided the Company with true and complete copies of all commitments and
agreements from third parties to provide such financing to Parent or Sub. Parent
shall keep the Company informed with respect to material activity concerning the
status of such financing, and shall give the Company prompt notice of any
material adverse change with respect to such financing.

                                    ARTICLE V

      5.02  No Solicitations.

      (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees (a) that neither it
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and it shall cause their respective
Representatives not to, initiate, solicit or encourage, directly or indirectly,
any inquiries or the making or implementation of any proposal or offer
(including, without limitation, any proposal or offer to its shareholders) with
respect to an Alternative Proposal, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential information or data to, or have any discussions with,
any Person or group relating to an Alternative Proposal (excluding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or grant any waiver or release
under any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement with respect to any
class of equity securities of the Company or any Subsidiary; and (b) that it
will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties with respect to any of the
foregoing, and it will take the necessary steps to inform such parties of its
obligations under this Section 5.02; provided, however, that nothing contained
in this Section 5.02 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from
(i) furnishing information to (but only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement
in customary form and having terms and conditions no less favorable to the
Company than the Confidentiality Agreement; provided, however, that any such
confidentiality agreement shall not restrict the parties thereto from making an
Alternative Proposal) or entering into discussions or negotiations with any
Person or group that makes an unsolicited bona fide Alternative Proposal, if a
majority of the


                                       27
<PAGE>
Board of Directors of the Company, without including directors who may be
considered Affiliates (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act) of any
person making an Alternative Proposal ("Disinterested Directors"), determines in
good faith (after receipt of advice from reputable outside legal counsel
experienced in such matters (including without limitation Thompson Hine) that
there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the failure to take any action that
would otherwise be prohibited by any such restriction would result in a breach
of the Board of Directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law) that the
Alternative Proposal is or presents a reasonable likelihood of resulting in a
Superior Proposal and was not solicited by it after the date hereof and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.02; and (ii) to the extent
required, taking and disclosing to the Company's shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with
regard to an Alternative Proposal, or making any other disclosure to the
Company's shareholders if, in the good faith judgment of a majority of the
Disinterested Directors, after being advised by reputable outside counsel
experienced in such matters (including without limitation, Thompson Hine), there
is a reasonable basis to conclude that disclosure is required under applicable
Law. The Company will promptly notify Parent after receipt of a proposal
relating to any Alternative Proposal or any request for information relating to
the Company or for access to the properties, books or records of the Company by
any Person that has made a proposal relating to an Alternative Proposal or any
Person who the Company believes in its reasonable judgment may be considering
making, or has made, a proposal relating to an Alternative Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information from any Person, and will keep Parent fully
informed on a current basis (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt of
an indication, request or a proposal relating to an Alternative Proposal, or any
revision of such proposal) of the status and details of any such Alternative
Proposal, indication or request. The Company will not enter into any agreement
or arrangement (other than a confidentiality agreement as described above), or
make any recommendation (except as contemplated by Section 5.021(a)(ii) above),
with respect to an Alternative Proposal that is or presents a reasonable
likelihood of resulting in a Superior Proposal for three business days after
delivery of such a notice to Parent indicating the Company's intention to enter
into such an agreement or arrangement, or to make such a recommendation, with
respect to such Alternative Proposal, which notice shall include all material
terms of such proposal, and the Company will negotiate exclusively in good faith
with Parent for such three-business day period to make such adjustments in the
terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed
with the transactions contemplated herein on such adjusted terms; provided,
however, that any such proposed adjustments shall be at the discretion of the
parties hereto at the time and that no more than one three-day negotiation
period shall apply to any particular Alternative Proposal, it being understood
that any material change to an Alternative Proposal will give rise to a new
three-day negotiation period under this Section 5.02, unless the Company shall
have notified Parent in writing that the Company does not intend to enter into
any agreement or arrangement (other than a confidentiality agreement as
described above), or make a recommendation, with respect to such Alternative
Proposal as modified by such material change. Nothing in this Section 5.02 shall
permit the Company to terminate this Agreement except as provided in Article
VIII.

      (b) Neither the Company nor the Board of Directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw or modify, in
any manner adverse to Parent, the approval or recommendation of this Agreement
or the Merger, or, except as contemplated by Section 5.02(a)(ii) above, propose
publicly to approve or recommend an


                                       28
<PAGE>
Alternative Proposal unless a majority of the Disinterested Directors
determines, in its good faith judgment (after receipt of advice from reputable
outside legal counsel experienced in such matters, including without limitation
Thompson Hine) that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the failure to
take such action would result in a breach of the Board of Directors' fiduciary
duties under applicable Law and the Company has otherwise complied with its
obligations under this Section 5.02.

      (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Alternative Proposal" means any
merger, consolidation or other business combination including the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any acquisition or similar transaction (including,
without limitation, a tender or exchange offer) involving the purchase of (i)
all or any significant portion of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, (ii) 20% or more of the outstanding Company Common Shares, or
(iii) any of the outstanding capital shares of any Subsidiary of the Company.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written
Alternative Proposal (with the percentages included in the definition of
Alternative Proposal replaced with 50% for purposes of this definition) that a
majority of the Disinterested Directors determines, in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with the Company's legal and financial advisors and taking
into account all the terms and conditions of the Alternative Proposal and this
Agreement deemed relevant by such Disinterested Directors): (i) that contains
terms that provide greater value to the Company's shareholders than the Merger
(and any revised proposal made by Parent); (ii) that is reasonably likely to be
completed, taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of the Alternative Proposal; and (iii) for which financing, to the
extent required, is, as of the date of the determination by the Disinterested
Directors, committed at least to the same extent as Parent's financing is
committed as of the date hereof.

      5.03 Financing-Related Cooperation. The Company agrees to provide, and
will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees and advisors to provide, all cooperation reasonably necessary in
connection with the arrangement of any financing to be consummated in respect of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including participation in
meetings, due diligence sessions, the execution and delivery of any commitment
letters, underwriting or placement agreements, pledge and security documents,
other definitive financing documents or other requested certificates or
documents as may be reasonably required by Parent and taking such other actions
as are reasonably required to by taken by the Company; provided that all such
agreements, letters, and instruments executed by the Company are unilaterally
revocable by the Company as to the Company prior to the Effective Time without
notice or penalty of any kind and do not obligate the Company to pay any fees or
expenses to such financing sources prior to the Effective Time; provided further
that Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the
disclosures made by Parent in response to representations and warranties
contained in any financing agreements executed by Parent in respect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not materially inconsistent with
the corresponding disclosures contained in the Company Disclosure Letter with
respect to the same or similar matters; and provided further, that Parent shall
use reasonable efforts not to materially interfere with the duties of such
officers, employees and advisors such that the Company's business and results of
operations would be materially adversely affected thereby. In addition, in
conjunction with the obtaining of any such financing, the Company agrees, at the
reasonable request of Parent, to call for prepayment or redemption, or to
prepay, redeem and/or renegotiate, as the case may be, any then existing
indebtedness of the Company and its


                                       29
<PAGE>
Subsidiaries; provided that no call for redemption or prepayment shall be
irrevocably made until contemporaneously with or after the Effective Time.

      5.04 SEC Reports. The Company shall cause the forms, reports, schedules,
statements and other documents required to be filed with the SEC by the Company
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time (the "New SEC
Reports") to be prepared in all material respects in accordance with provisions
set forth in Section 3.05(a) hereof.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

      6.01 Access to Information; Confidentiality. The Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, throughout the period from the date hereof to
the Effective Time, (i) provide Parent and its Representatives with full access,
upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to all officers,
employees, agents and accountants of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective assets, properties, books and records, but only to the extent that
such access does not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) furnish promptly to Parent (x) a copy
of each report, statement, schedule and other document filed or received by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities laws and each material report, statement, schedule and other
document filed with any other Governmental or Regulatory Authority, and (y) all
other information and data (including, without limitation, copies of Contracts,
Company Employee Benefit Plans and other books and records) concerning the
business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or any of
such other Persons shall reasonably request. No investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.01 or otherwise shall affect any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. Any
such information or material obtained pursuant to this Section 6.01 shall be
governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 24,
2003, with the Company, which Parent and Sub hereby adopt as binding on each of
them as if each of them were a party to the such agreement (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality contained herein
or in the Confidentiality Agreement shall not apply, and any party hereto or its
employees, representatives and other agents may disclose to any and all persons,
without limitation of any kind, (a) the "tax treatment" and "tax structure" of
the "transactions" contemplated by this Agreement (as these terms are defined in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.6011-4(b) and (c)) and (b) all materials of any
kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to it relating
to such tax treatment or tax structure; provided, however, that such disclosure
may not be made (to persons other than tax advisors) (i) until the earlier of
(A) the date of the public announcement of the discussions relating to such
transactions, (B) the date of the public announcement of such transactions or
(C) the date of the execution of this Agreement and (ii) to the extent required
to be kept confidential to comply with any applicable federal or state
securities Laws.

      6.02  Preparation of Proxy Statement; Schedule 13E.

      (a) The Company shall prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement as
soon as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, and shall use its

the Company, Parent and Sub agrees to use its reasonable best efforts, after

regulations of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions substantially

Company's employees, agents, directors or officers for acts or omissions
occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, except if such amendment is
required by applicable Law. Any determination required to be made with respect
to whether an officer's or director's conduct complies with the standards set
forth in the Company's articles of incorporation or code of regulations shall be
made by independent counsel selected by Parent and reasonably acceptable to such
officer or director. Parent shall pay such counsel's fees and expenses so long
as such officer or director does not challenge any such determination by such
independent counsel. With respect to acts or omissions occurring on or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, until the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time and for so long thereafter as any claim for
insurance coverage asserted on or prior to such date has not been fully
adjudicated, cause to be maintained in effect, at no cost to the beneficiaries
thereof, to the extent available, the policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof to the extent that such insurance coverage can be maintained at an
annual cost to the Surviving Corporation of not greater than 200% of the annual
premium for the Company's current insurance policies and, if such insurance
coverage cannot be so purchased or maintained at such cost, providing as much of
such insurance as can be so purchased or maintained at such cost.

assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume its
obligations set forth in this Section 6.06.

with the filings required under the HSR Act.

paid to Sub for the issuance of its stock to Parent) or any material
liabilities. Parent will take all action necessary to cause Sub to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and

claims, liabilities or obligations with respect to any other such fee or
commission or expenses related thereto asserted by any Person on the basis of
any act or statement alleged to have been made by such party or its Affiliate.

share acquisition" or other form of anti-takeover statute or regulation shall
become applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Company and the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company shall, to the extent permitted
by law, grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary

permitted by Law, to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

Parent or the Company under this Agreement to be breached or that renders or
will render untrue any representation or warranty of Parent or the Company
contained in this Agreement. Each of Parent and the Company also will notify the
other in writing of, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cure before
the Closing, any violation or breach, as soon as practicable after it becomes
known to such party, of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by Parent or the Company in this Agreement. No notice given pursuant to this
Section 6.12 shall have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining
satisfaction of any condition contained herein.

      6.13 Fulfillment of Conditions. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of Parent and the Company will take or cause to be taken
commercially reasonable steps necessary or desirable to satisfy each condition
to the other's obligations contained in this Agreement and to consummate and
make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and neither
Parent nor the Company will, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take
or fail to take any action that could be reasonably expected to result in the
non-fulfillment of any such condition.

same day funds within two (2) business days of such occurrence, a termination
fee of (Two Million Dollars) ($2,000,000) (the "Termination Fee"). If, with
respect to the events described in clauses (ii) and (iii), above, an Alternative

Fee.

      (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to

payment or payments are made in full compliance with Section 8.02(b), 8.02(c) or
8.02(d), the receipt of such payment shall serve as liquidated damages with
respect to any breach of this Agreement by the party who has made such payment
giving rise to such termination, and the receipt of any such payment shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy (at law or in equity) with respect to any such
breach. In the event any action, suit, proceeding or claim is commenced or
asserted by a party against another party and/or any director or officer of such
other party relating, directly or indirectly, to this Agreement, it is expressly

treble, or consequential damages of any type under any circumstances in
connection with such action, suit, proceeding or claim, regardless of whether
such damages may be available under law, the parties hereby waiving their
