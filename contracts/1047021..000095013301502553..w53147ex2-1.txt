Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) for those requirements
which become applicable to such Seller as a result of the specific regulatory

Effect.   ARTICLE VII  COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES   Section 7.1 Conduct of
Business.   (a) Except as described on Schedule 7.1(a) and except as 
required by the Bankruptcy Court, during the period commencing on the  date
of the Original Agreement and ending on the Closing Date, the  Sellers shall
(i) operate the Operating Business in the usual, regular  and ordinary
course, (ii) other than as permitted in writing by the  Buyer, preserve in
all material respects the Operating Business, and  (iii) endeavor to
preserve, in   23    28   all material respects, the goodwill and
relationships with customers,  suppliers and others having business dealings
with the Operating  Business, in each case, taking into account each of the
Seller\'s current  status as a filer under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,
the Cash  Collateral Order, the discontinuance of service referenced in
Section  7.1(c) herein and the Sellers\' plan to decommission the
facilities  reflected in the letter dated August 21, 2001, from Teligent to
the  Buyer.   (b) Prior to the Closing Date, without the prior written 
consent of the Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, no  Seller
shall (i) terminate, extend or otherwise amend any of the FCC  Licenses or
FCC Analogous Licenses or (ii) other than Permitted  Encumbrances, create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist any Encumbrance  upon the Purchased Assets
(taking into account the Cash Collateral  Order), in each case, other than in
the ordinary course of business.  Prior to the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of the  Buyer, no Seller shall sell, lease (as lessor),
transfer or otherwise  dispose of, any of the Purchased Assets.   (c) Prior
to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall (i)  continue all activities necessary
to preserve and maintain in full force  and effect the FCC Licenses and the
FCC Analogous Licenses and (ii)  undertake to discontinue the provision of
local and data services in the  markets listed in Schedule 7.1(c). The
Sellers shall submit applications  seeking approval of, or make other
necessary filings at, state  regulatory commissions in relevant states for
such discontinuance. In  discontinuing service, the Sellers shall provide
reasonable customer  notice and otherwise comply with all federal and state
regulatory  requirements.   (d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
take no  action or actions which would constitute the exercise of control
over  the FCC Licenses or FCC Analogous Licenses.   Section 7.2 Buyer
Equity Offering. The Buyer shall use its best efforts to either (a)
consummate the Buyer Equity Offering or (b) show evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Sellers of the Committed Financing by no later than two
(2) days prior to the date of the auction conducted pursuant to the
Bid Procedures or provide other assurance reasonably acceptable to the
Sellers that the Buyer will be able to fund the Cash Consideration at the
Closing.   Section 7.3 Rights Related to the Stock Consideration. The
Buyer shall provide to the Sellers and any subsequent holders of the
Stock Consideration all rights to registration thereof under the securities
laws, rights to financial reports and all other rights which are
provided contractually by the Buyer to the investors under the Buyer Equity
Offering in connection with their acquisition of Buyer Common as if the Stock
Consideration had been issued to the Sellers pursuant to the Buyer Equity
Offering; provided, that the Sellers and any subsequent holders of the Stock
Consideration shall agree to be subject to all limitations and obligations of
the investors under the Buyer Equity Offering relating to such registration
rights.   24    29   Section 7.4 Access to Information.   (a) Between
the date of the Original Agreement and the  Closing Date, each Seller shall,
during ordinary business hours, upon  reasonable notice (i) give the Buyer
and the Buyer Representatives  reasonable access to all books, records,
plants, offices and other  facilities and properties constituting the
Purchased Assets to which the  Buyer is not denied access by law, (ii) permit

operating data and other  information with respect to the Business as the
Buyer may from time to  time reasonably request, (iv) furnish the Buyer a
copy of each material  report, schedule or other document filed or received
by such Seller with  respect to the Business with the SEC; provided, however,
that (A) any  such access shall be conducted in such a manner so as not to
interfere  unreasonably with the operation of the Business, (B) such Seller
shall  not be required to take any action which would constitute a waiver
of  the attorney-client privilege and (C) such Seller need not supply the 
Buyer with any information which such Seller is under a legal obligation  not
to supply. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.4(a) to the  contrary,
the Buyer shall not have access to any of the Seller\'s  customer lists,
Transferring Employee Records and personnel and medical  records, which in
such Seller\'s good faith judgment is sensitive or the  disclosure of which
could subject such Seller to any risk of liability.   (b) The Buyer and the
Sellers acknowledge that they are  subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.
All information furnished to  or obtained by the Buyer or any of the Buyer
Representatives or the  Sellers or any of the Sellers\' Representatives
pursuant to this  Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the
Confidentiality  Agreement and shall be treated as Confidential Information
for all  purposes of the Confidentiality Agreement.   (c) For a period of
three (3) years (subject to Section  7.10(a)) after the Closing Date, each
party and its representatives  shall have reasonable access to all of the
books and records relating to  the Business or the Purchased Assets,
including, without limitation, all  information pertaining to the Assumed
Agreements, all Transferring  Employee Records or other personnel and medical
records required by law,  legal process or subpoena, in the possession of the
other party to the  extent that such access may reasonably be required by
such party in  connection with the Assumed Obligations or the Excluded
Liabilities, or  other matters relating to or affected by the operation of
the Business  and the Purchased Assets. Such access shall be afforded by the
party in  possession of such books and records upon receipt of reasonable
advance  notice and during normal business hours; provided, however, that (i)
any  such access shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere 
unreasonably with the operation of the business of any party or its 
Affiliates, (ii) no party shall be required to take any action which  would
constitute a waiver of the attorney-client privilege, and (iii) no  party
need supply the other party with any information which such party  is under a
legal obligation not to supply. The party exercising this  right of access
shall be solely responsible for any costs or expenses  incurred by it
pursuant to this Section 7.4(c). If the party in  possession   25   
30    of such books and records shall desire to dispose of any such books
and  records upon or prior to the expiration of such period, such party 
shall, prior to such disposition, give the other party a reasonable 
opportunity at such other party\'s expense, to segregate and remove such 
books and records as such other party may select.   Section 7.5 Expenses.
Except to the extent specifically provided herein, whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby shall be borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses.  
Section 7.6 Further Assurances.   (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement,  each of the parties hereto shall use reasonable best efforts
to take, or  cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done,
all  things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws 
and regulations to consummate and make effective the sale of the  Purchased
Assets in accordance with this Agreement, including without  limitation using
reasonable best efforts to ensure satisfaction of the  conditions precedent
to each party\'s obligations hereunder and obtaining  all FCC Consents or FCC
Analogous Consents that have not become Final  Orders prior to the Closing
Date. Neither any of the Sellers, on the one  hand, nor the Buyer, on the
other hand, shall, without the prior written  consent of the other party (it
being understood that the written consent  of Teligent shall have the same
effect as the consent of all of the  Sellers), take any action which would
reasonably be expected to prevent  or materially impede, interfere with or
delay the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. From time to time on
or after the  Closing Date, each Seller shall, at its own expense, execute
and deliver  such documents to the Buyer as the Buyer may reasonably request
in order  to more effectively vest in the Buyer such Seller\'s title to the 
Purchased Assets subject to Permitted Encumbrances. From time to time  after
the date of the Original Agreement, the Buyer shall, at its own  expense,
execute and deliver such documents to each Seller as such  Seller may
reasonably request in order to more effectively consummate  the sale of the
Purchased Assets and the assumption and assignment of  the Assumed
Obligations and the Assumed Agreements in accordance with  this
Agreement.   (b) In the event that any Purchased Asset shall not have  been
conveyed to the Buyer at the Closing, the applicable Seller shall,  subject
to Section 7.6(c), use reasonable best efforts to convey such  asset to the
Buyer as promptly as is practicable after the Closing.   (c) To the extent
that any of the Sellers\' rights under any  Assumed Agreement may not be
assigned without the consent of another  Person which consent has not been
obtained, this Agreement shall not  constitute an agreement to assign the
same if an attempted assignment  would constitute a breach thereof or be
unlawful and such Seller shall  use reasonable best efforts (without being
required to make any payment  to any third party or to incur any economic
burden and taking into  account such Seller\'s status as a filer under
Chapter 11 of the  Bankruptcy Code, the Cash Collateral Order, the
discontinuance of  services referenced in Section 7.1(c) herein and the
Sellers\' plan to     26    31    decommission the facilities
reflected in the letter dated August 21,  2001, from Teligent to the Buyer)
to obtain any such required consent(s)  as promptly as reasonably possible
unless failure to obtain such consent  would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse  Effect, and the Buyer agrees to cooperate
with such Seller in its  efforts to obtain any such consent (including the
submission of such  financial or other information concerning the Buyer and
the execution of  any assumption agreements or similar documents reasonably
requested by a  third party) without being required to make any payment to
any third  party or to incur any economic burden.   Section 7.7 Public
Statements. Teligent and the Buyer shall consult with each other prior to
issuing any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except that the
parties may make disclosures with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby to the extent and under the circumstances in
which the parties are expressly permitted by the Confidentiality Agreement to
make disclosures of Confidential Information.   Section 7.8 Governmental
Entity Consents and Approvals.   (a) FCC Consents. Subject to Section
7.8(e), within five  (5) Business Days after the date of the Original

FCC Consents and  thereafter, shall timely make all other filings and
notifications and  timely seek all such consents, licenses, approvals,
permits, waivers,  orders or authorizations as may be required to obtain the
FCC Consents.  The Sellers shall cooperate with the Buyer to the fullest
extent  reasonably possible to provide all necessary information for the 
preparation of such applications, including those portions of such 
applications which are required to be completed by the Sellers. The  Buyer
shall bear the fees payable to the FCC in connection with the  preparation
and filing of the applications for the FCC Consents;  provided, that no
filing fees incurred in connection with the  application or applications
seeking the FCC Consents shall be paid by  the Buyer unless and until the Bid
Procedures are approved by the  Bankruptcy Court.   (b) HSR Act. Subject to
Section 7.8(e), within ten (10)  Business Days after the entry of the Sale
Order by the Bankruptcy Court  or at such other time as the Sellers and the
Buyer mutually agree is  appropriate, the Sellers and the Buyer shall each
prepare and file, or  cause to be prepared and filed, with the Federal Trade
Commission and/or  the United States Department of Justice, as the case may
be, all  requisite applications and amendments thereto together with
related  information, data and exhibits necessary to satisfy any applicable 
requirements of the HSR Act. Each party shall promptly respond to any 
requests for additional information in connection with such filings and 
shall take all other reasonable actions to cause the waiting periods  under
the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date  after the
date of filing. The Buyer shall be responsible for payment of  the
application filing fee under the HSR Act, but not the Sellers\' costs  and
expenses (including attorneys\' fees and other legal fees and  expenses)
associated with the preparation of the Sellers\' portion of  such
filing.     27    32    (c) FCC Analogous Consents. Subject to
Section 7.8(e),  within ten (10) Business Days after the date of the Original
Agreement,  the Sellers and/or the Buyer, as applicable, shall each file or
cause to  be filed with any state or local regulatory authorities analogous
to the  FCC applications for the approval of the assignment of the FCC
Analogous  Licenses. The Sellers and the Buyer shall prosecute such
applications  with all reasonable diligence and otherwise use their
reasonable best  efforts to obtain grants of approval as expeditiously as
practicable.  The Buyer shall bear the fees payable to the state and local
regulatory  entities in connection with the preparation and filing of the 
applications for the FCC Analogous Consents.   (d) Other Governmental Entity
Approvals. The Sellers and  the Buyer shall each use their reasonable best
efforts to cooperate with  each other in determining any filings,
notifications and requests for  approval (other than the FCC Consents, the
FCC Analogous Consents and  the filings by the Sellers and the Buyer required
by the HSR Act and the  expiration or earlier termination of all waiting
periods under the HSR  Act) required to be made and received prior to the
Closing under  applicable law or regulation (collectively, the " Other
Regulatory  Approvals"). In connection with any Other Regulatory Approvals,
neither  the Buyer nor any of the Sellers will, and each of them will use
its  reasonable best efforts not to, cause or permit any of its officers, 
directors, partners or other Affiliates to, take any action which could 
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the submission  of
any required filings or notifications or the grant of any such 
approvals.   (e) Cooperation. The Sellers and the Buyer (i) shall  promptly
inform each other of any communication from any Governmental  Entity
concerning this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby,  and any
filing, notification or request for approval and (ii) shall  permit the other
party to review in advance any proposed written  communication or information
submitted to any such Governmental Entity  in response thereto. In addition,
each of the Sellers and the Buyer  shall not agree to participate in any
meeting with any Governmental  Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or other inquiry with  respect to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or any  such filing, notification or request
for approval unless it consults  with the other party in advance and, to the
extent permitted by any such  Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and  participate thereat, in each case to the maximum
extent practicable.  Subject to any restrictions under applicable laws, rules
or regulations,  each of the Sellers and the Buyer shall furnish the other
party with  copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and
memoranda  setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates
and  their respective representatives on the one hand, and the Governmental 
Entity or members of its staff on the other hand, with respect to this 
Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (excluding documents and 
communications which are subject to preexisting confidentiality  agreements
and to the attorney-client privilege or work product  doctrine) or any such
filing, notification or request for approval. The  Sellers and the Buyer
shall also furnish the other party with such  necessary information and
assistance as such other party and its  Affiliates may reasonably request in
connection with their preparation  of necessary filings, registration, or
submissions of information to the  Governmental Entity in connection with
this Agreement, the transactions  contemplated hereby and any such filing,
notification or     28    33    request for approval. The Sellers
and the Buyer shall prosecute all  required requests for approval with all
necessary diligence and  otherwise use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain the  grant thereof by a Final Order as soon as
possible.   Section 7.9 Fees and Commissions. Subject to the Buyer\'s rights
to reimbursement of expenses under Section 7.15 with respect to the expenses
which may be incurred in connection with the defense or indemnity as set

liabilities for all brokerage fees, commissions and finder\'s fees incurred
by reason of any action taken by such party.   Section 7.10 Tax
Matters.   (a) Cooperation on Tax Matters. The Buyer and the Sellers  agree
to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request,  as promptly
as practicable, such information and assistance relating to  the Business and
the Purchased Assets (including, without limitation,  access to books and
records) as is reasonably necessary for the  preparation and filing of all
Tax returns in connection with matters  relating to or affected by the
operations of the Sellers prior to the  Closing, including the making of any
election relating to Taxes, the  preparation for any audit by any taxing
authority, and the prosecution  or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Buyer and the  Sellers shall retain all books and records with respect to
Taxes  pertaining to the Purchased Assets for a period of at least six (6) 
years following the Closing Date. At the end of such period, each party 
shall provide the other with at least thirty (30) days prior written  notice
before destroying any such books and records, during which period  the party
receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at its own  expense, of
such books and records. The Sellers and the Buyer shall  cooperate with each
other in the conduct of any audit or other  proceeding relating to Taxes
involving the Purchased Assets or the  Business.   (b) Transfer Taxes. All
excise, sales, use, transfer, value  added, registration, stamp, recording,
documentary, conveyancing,  franchise, property, transfer, gains and similar
Taxes, levies, charges  and recording, filing and other fees (collectively,
"Transfer Taxes")  incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this  Agreement shall be paid by the Buyer. The Buyer shall, at its own 
expense, file all necessary Tax returns and other documentation with  respect
to all such Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable law,  the
appropriate Seller shall join in the execution of any Tax returns  and other
documentation at the Buyer\'s request. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, the
Sellers shall seek in the Sale Order a decretal paragraph  which provides
that, in accordance with Section 1146(c) of the  Bankruptcy Code, the
transactions contemplated hereby are steps in the  formulation, or
anticipation of the formulation, of a Chapter 11 plan  for the Sellers and,
as such, the making or delivery of any instrument  of transfer to effectuate
the transactions contemplated hereby shall not  be taxed under any law
imposing a stamp tax or similar tax.   Section 7.11 Supplements to
Schedules. Prior to the Closing Date,  the Sellers may supplement or amend
the Schedules furnished by them  pursuant to this Agreement with    
29    34    respect to any matter relating to the Purchased Assets or
the Business.  In the event such supplements and amendments are reasonably
anticipated  by the parties to give rise to adverse economic consequences to
the  Operating Business or the Purchased Assets, the Buyer may either 
terminate this Agreement without liability or close the transaction (in 
which event any breach of any representation or warranty made by the  Sellers
which would otherwise exist absent such supplements and  amendments shall be
deemed cured for all purposes of this Agreement);  provided, however, that
the Buyer may not terminate this Agreement if  such adverse economic
consequences would not, individually or in the  aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.   Section 7.12 Employees.   (a) No later than thirty (30)
days after the entry of the  Sale Order, in which case the Sellers shall have
adequate time to comply  with the WARN Act, the Buyer shall provide the
Sellers with the identity  of the Sellers\' employees to whom the Buyer
intends to make offers of  employment and the general terms of such offers;
provided that the Buyer  shall notify the Sellers no later than one (1)
Business Day after any  change to the identity of the Sellers\' employees to
whom the Buyer will  make offers of employment or any change to the general
terms of such  offers. The Sellers shall timely provide and shall be solely
responsible  for any required WARN notice with respect to any remaining
employees of  the Sellers to whom the Buyer intends not to make offers and to
any  other employees to whom such notice may be required in the Sellers\'

the employment of the Buyer for any  specified period of time from and after
the Closing Date.   (b) The Sellers shall be responsible for all obligations
and  liabilities under the WARN Act to the extent applicable and under 
applicable state and local laws (the "WARN Obligations") arising solely  as a

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for purposes of this

party who acquires from and     33    38    after the date of the
Original Agreement, for purposes of consummating a  purchase or acquisition
of all or substantially all of the Purchased  Assets, any of the claims of
the Sellers\' lenders under that certain  Credit Agreement, dated as of July
2, 1998.   (b) The parties hereto shall use their respective reasonable 
best efforts to obtain the entry of an order approving the Bid  Procedures on
an expedited basis within fourteen (14) days after the  motion with respect
thereto is filed with the Bankruptcy Court. As soon  as is practicable after
the date of the Original Agreement, the Sellers  (or Teligent on their
behalf) shall file with the Bankruptcy Court a  motion, supporting papers,
notices, and a form of sale order,  substantially in the form of the order
attached hereto as Exhibit G,  seeking the Bankruptcy Court\'s approval of
this Agreement, the Sellers\'  performance under this Agreement, the
assumption and assignment of the  Assumed Agreements and Assumed Obligations,
and the Sellers\' retention  of the Excluded Assets (the "Sale Order"). The
Sale Order shall be in  form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Buyer and shall  provide, without limitation, that:   (i) as of the
Closing, the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement will effect a
legal, valid, enforceable and  effective sale and transfer of each of the
Purchased Assets to  the Buyer and shall vest the Buyer with good title to
the  Purchased Assets free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than 
Permitted Encumbrances);   (ii) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  constitute reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration 
for the Purchased Assets being purchased; and   (iii) the Buyer is a good
faith purchaser of the  Purchased Assets, as that term is used in Section
363(m) of the  Bankruptcy Code.   (c) As soon as practicable after the
approval by the  Bankruptcy Court of the Bid Procedures, the Sellers (or
Teligent on  their behalf) shall file with the Bankruptcy Court a motion,
supporting  papers, notices, and a form of financing order mutually agreeable
to the  Sellers and the Buyer seeking the Bankruptcy Court\'s approval for
the  Sellers to borrow up to $25,000,000 from the Buyer pursuant to Section 
364 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "DIP Order"). The DIP Order shall  provide
that in connection with the proposed financing, the Buyer is  acting in "good
faith" and is entitled to the protections of Section  364(e) of the
Bankruptcy Code. In addition, the DIP Order shall provide  that such
financing shall be secured on a super-priority basis by liens  that, pursuant
to Section 364(c) or Section 364(d) of the Bankruptcy  Code, shall be senior
in priority to all Encumbrances, including those  of the Pre-Petition Secured
Lenders on the Purchased Assets.   (d) Commencing on the later to occur of:
(i) the entry of  the DIP Order by the Bankruptcy Court and (ii) the entry of
the Sale  Order by the Bankruptcy Court, until the Closing, at the election
of the  Sellers, the Buyer shall lend to the Sellers an amount up to
$25,000,000  to be used in the operations of the Sellers related solely and 
exclusively to the Operating Business (the "Interim Financing"). The  Interim
Financing shall be made on the terms and subject to the  conditions of a
credit facility in the form attached hereto     34    39   as Exhibit
H (the "Debtor-in-Possession Working Capital Facility").  Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, none of the following  actions shall
constitute a breach or default of the Sellers under this  Agreement: (A) the
withdrawal by the Sellers of the request for approval  of the Interim
Financing prior to the entry of the DIP Order by the  Bankruptcy Court, (B)
the Sellers\' election to not borrow under the  Interim Financing or (C) the
repayment and/or termination of the Interim  Financing in accordance with the
terms of the Debtor-in-Possession  Working Capital Facility.   Section 7.16
Investor Qualification. The Sellers shall not transfer any portion of the
Stock Consideration to any Person who is not a "qualified institutional
buyer" as that term is defined under Rule 144A of the Securities Act.  
Section 7.17 Management Agreements.   (a) In the event any FCC Analogous
Consent for any state  listed in Section 8.2(h) has not become a Final Order
by the Closing  Date, but a majority of the FCC Analogous Consents listed in
Section  8.2(h), including those for California, Texas and New York, have
become  Final Orders, then the Buyer and TSI shall enter into a management 
agreement for each of the other states set forth in Section 8.2(h) for  which
a Final Order has not yet been obtained. Pursuant to such  management
agreement, the Buyer shall act as manager of the operations  in such state or
jurisdiction on behalf of TSI and at the direction of  TSI and consistent
with all applicable laws and regulations until such  FCC Analogous Consent
has become a Final Order; provided that, if the  Buyer and Teligent (on
behalf of the Sellers) each reasonably believes  that entering into such
management agreement pending such FCC Analogous  Consent becoming a Final
Order in such state would materially adversely  affect the timing or outcome
of obtaining a Final Order granting such  FCC Analogous Consent, then the
Buyer and TSI shall not enter into such  management agreement.   (b) In the
event any FCC Analogous Consent for any state  other than the states listed
in Section 8.2(h) has not become a Final  Order by the Closing Date, then, at
the Buyer\'s option, the Buyer and  TSI shall enter into a management
agreement whereby the Buyer shall act  as manager of the operations in such
state on behalf of TSI and at the  direction of TSI and consistent with all
applicable laws and regulations  until such FCC Analogous Consent has become
a Final Order.   Section 7.18 Transition Services.   (a) At or prior to
the Closing, the Buyer and Teligent, on  behalf of itself and the other
Sellers, agree to negotiate and enter  into a mutually acceptable transition
services agreement (the  "Transition Services Agreement") whereby the Buyer
shall provide, or  shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, to the Sellers
various  services, including without limitation, financial services (e.g., 
controller functions, payroll functions, financial reporting functions, 
systems management functions, accounts payable functions),  infrastructure
support services (e.g., information technology and  application support),
operations support services (e.g., storage space,  office space, etc.), and
human    35  40   resources services (e.g., staffing), pursuant to
mutually acceptable and  reasonable terms and conditions.   (b) For a
period of three (3) years after the Closing Date  (the "Transition Period"),
the Sellers, the Buyer and their  representatives shall have reasonable
access to, and each shall have the  right to photocopy at their own expense,
all of the books and records,  including any computerized databases and files
and programs and  associated software, (the "Books and Records") relating to
the  pre-Closing operations of the Sellers and/or the Purchased Assets as 
they existed as of the Closing Date, including but not limited to (i)  the
investigation, evaluation and prosecution of any and all causes of  action
retained by any Seller, (ii) the evaluation and defense of any  and all
claims brought against the estate of any Seller and (iii) all  Transferred
Employees\' records or other personnel and medical records  required by law,
legal process or subpoena, in the possession of the  other party to the
extent that such access may reasonably be required by  such party in
connection with the Assumed Obligations and Excluded  Liabilities, or other
matters relating to or affected by the operation  of the Business or use of
the Purchased Assets. During the Transition  Period, the Buyer agrees to
provide Teligent and any of its  representatives, during ordinary business
hours, upon reasonable request  and notice and at Teligent\'s expense, with
reasonable access to  employees of the Buyer for purposes of winding down the
estates of the  Sellers. Access pursuant to this Section 7.18(b) shall be
afforded by  the party in possession of such Books and Records, upon receipt
of  reasonable advance notice, during normal business hours and at the 
expense of the requesting party; provided, however, that (A) any such 
investigation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to interfere 
unreasonably with the operation of the business of any party, (B) no  party
shall be required to take any action which would constitute a  waiver of the
attorney-client privilege or which would require the  disclosure of
confidential information and (C) no party need to supply  the other party
with any information which such party is under a legal  obligation not to
supply. The party exercising this right of access  shall be solely
responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it  pursuant to this
Section 7.18(b). If the party in possession of such  Books and Records shall
desire to dispose of any such Books and Records  upon or prior to the
expiration of such period, such party shall, prior  to such disposition, give
the other party a reasonable opportunity at  such other party\'s expense, to
segregate and remove such Books and  Records as such other party may
select.   ARTICLE VIII  CONDITIONS TO CLOSING   Section 8.1 Conditions to

Adverse  Effect; and   (d) on or before October 31, 2001, the Bankruptcy

Closing  and such violation or breach has not been cured by the Sellers
within  ten (10) Business Days of receipt of written notice thereof or waived
by  the Buyer;   (c) the Sellers, if there has been a material violation

the Buyer, if the Bid Procedures are not approved by the  Bankruptcy Court
within fifteen (15) Business Days after the date of the  Original Agreement

the Buyer or the Sellers, if the Sale Order has not been  entered by the

Bankruptcy Court on or prior to October 31, 2001; provided that the  Sellers
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to  this Section
