Rata Portion of the applicable Contingent Payment, if any, to be paid to such
holder at the time and in the manner set forth in Section 9.1.

2.7 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
retired  



 

12  and shall cease to exist, and no holder of record of a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of the
Company Capital Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall have any rights as a
stockholder of the Company and each Certificate (i) representing any
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
shares as set forth in this Agreement and (ii) representing any Dissenting
Shares shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the payments
described in Section 2.9.

 

(b) At or promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or shall
cause to be deposited with a paying agent designated by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of Former
Stockholders, an amount in cash sufficient in the aggregate to provide all
funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments to each Former
Stockholder of the amounts set forth in Sections 2.6(a) and (b). From and
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall act as the agent of Parent
and the Surviving Company in effecting any amounts to be paid under this
Agreement and the exchange of the Certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock. In the
event that Parent elects, in its sole discretion pursuant to Section 2.11(a),
2.11(e) or 9.1(b)(ii) of this Agreement, to have the Paying Agent make the
applicable payments under Section 2.6(a) or (b) to former holders of Company
Warrants, former holders of Vested Company Options and/or former holders of
Units, Parent shall make appropriate arrangements with the Paying Agent to
such effect and all references to "Former Stockholders" in this Section 2.7
shall be deemed to apply to "Former Securityholders," unless the context
expressly requires otherwise. 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent,
together with a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof), such
letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, (i) the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a payment of the
applicable amount provided in Section 2.6 with respect to such Certificate
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings) and (ii) the
Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Parent shall, no later
than two business days after receipt of each properly surrendered
Certificate, cause the Paying Agent to make the payment of the applicable
amount provided in Sections 2.6(a) and (b) to the holder of such Certificate,
in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by such holder in the letter of transmittal delivered with such
Certificate. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay to each holder of a
properly surrendered Certificate, at the time and in the manner set forth
in Section 9.1, such holders applicable Pro Rata Portion of any Contingent
Payment to be paid as provided in Section 2.6(c). Until so surrendered, each
outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented shares
of Company Capital Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to
receive a payment of the applicable amount provided in Section 2.6. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, it shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Section
2.7. No interest shall be paid or accrued after the Effective Time on any
amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates.  



 

13  If payment is to be made to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate surrendered, it shall be a condition of such payment that
the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or establish
to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax was paid or is not
applicable.

(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and there shall thereafter be no further registration of transfers of
shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time on the records of the Company. At and after the Effective Time,
each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have rights as a stockholder of
the Company, except for the right to surrender his or her Certificate in
exchange for the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration, or to the
extent but only to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to assert
dissenters rights and no transfer of Shares shall thereafter be made on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Paying Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the applicable portion
of the Merger Consideration.

(e) Upon the earlier to occur of (i) the 90th calendar day following the
Closing Date and (ii) the earliest date as of which the Paying Agent has made
payments pursuant to Sections 2.6(a) and (b) of this Agreement in exchange for
at least 90% of the aggregate number of shares of Company Capital Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Paying Agents
duties shall terminate in respect of payments pursuant to Sections 2.6(a) and
(b) of this Agreement, and any cash deposited in the account of the Paying
Agent in respect of payments pursuant to Sections 2.6(a) and (b) of this
Agreement shall be transferred to an account of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent managed and held for the benefit of the Former Stockholders. In the
event that Parent elects, in its sole discretion pursuant to Section 2.11(a),
2.11(e) or 9.1(b)(iii) of this Agreement to have the Paying Agent make the
applicable payments under Section 2.6(c) to Former Securityholders, upon the
earlier to occur of (i) the 90th calendar day following the payment by
Parent, or on Parents behalf, of the applicable amounts to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 9.1(a) of this Agreement and (ii) the earliest date as of
which the Paying Agent has made payments pursuant to Section 2.6(c) of this
Agreement in exchange for at least 90% of the aggregate number of shares of
Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Paying Agents duties shall terminate in respect of
payments pursuant to Section 2.6(c) of this Agreement, and any cash deposited
in the account of the Paying Agent in respect of payments pursuant to Section
2.6(c) of this Agreement shall be transferred to an account of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent managed and held for the benefit of such
persons. Thereafter, any Former Securityholder that has not theretofore
exchanged its shares in accordance with this Section 2.7 shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of any amounts to be paid under
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, the Paying Agent or any other person shall be liable to any
Former Securityholder for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.



 

14 2.8 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by such record holder, the Paying Agent shall pay to the record
holder of such Certificate the applicable payment of the applicable amounts
provided in Sections 2.6(a) and (b) to be paid in respect of the shares
represented thereby upon due surrender of and deliverable in respect of the
shares represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement and such
person also shall be entitled to the right to receive the applicable portion
of the Contingent Payments to be distributed or provided in Section 2.6 at the
time and in the manner set forth in Section 9.1; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent or the Paying Agent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such consideration, require such record holder to
deliver a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against Parent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate.

2.9 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any share of Company Capital Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which is held by a stockholder who
did not consent to or vote in favor of the approval of this Agreement, which
stockholder complies with all of the provisions of Delaware Law or, if
applicable, California Law, relevant to the exercise and perfection of
appraisal or, if applicable, dissenters rights (such share being a "
_Dissenting Share_ ," and such stockholder being a " _Dissenting Stockholder_
"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the consideration to
which the holder of such share would be entitled pursuant to Section 2.6, but
rather shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as may
be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Share pursuant to
Delaware Law or, if applicable, California Law. If any Dissenting Stockholder
fails to perfect such stockholders appraisal or, if applicable, dissenters,
rights under Delaware Law or, if applicable, California Law, or effectively
withdraws or otherwise loses such rights with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon automatically be
converted into the right to receive the applicable amounts provided in Section
2.6, pursuant to the exchange procedures set forth in Section 2.7. The Company
will promptly give Parent notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal or, if applicable, dissenters rights, attempted withdrawals of such
demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law received
by the Company with respect to its stockholders appraisal or, if applicable,
dissenters, rights. Parent shall have the opportunity to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demand for appraisal under the
Delaware Law or, if applicable, California Law. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands regarding appraisals
of or payments for Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands. The Company shall
comply with its obligations pursuant to Section 1301(a) of California Law
within ten calendar days following the date of this Agreement.

2.10 _Taking of Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Article II of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all Assets, IP Rights, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in their respective names to take,
and will take, all such lawful and necessary or desirable action, so long as
such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.



 

15 2.11 _Treatment of Company Warrants, Company Options and Units_.

(a) At the Effective Time, with no further action required on the part of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any holder thereof,
each outstanding Company Warrant, whether or not then exercisable, shall only
entitle the holder thereof to receive the amounts provided for in Section 2.6
with respect to holders of Company Warrants. After the Effective Time, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent (as Parent
shall determine in its sole discretion) to, deliver the amounts provided for
in Sections 2.6(a) and (b) with respect to holders of Company Warrants
to such holders of Company Warrants (solely with respect to shares of Company
Capital Stock covered by such Company Warrants) as soon as reasonably
practicable after (i) the surrender by such holder of its Company Warrant and
(ii) the execution by such holders of an instrument, in form furnished by
Parent, providing for the appointment by such holder of the Stockholders
Agent pursuant to Section 9.3 of this Agreement and such other matters as
Parent may reasonably request. Subject to a Company Warrant holders
compliance with the terms of clauses (i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence,
at the time and in the manner set forth in Section 9.1, Parent shall deliver
such Company Warrant holders applicable Pro Rata Portion of any Contingent
Payment to be paid as provided in Section 2.6(c) (solely with respect to
shares of Company Capital Stock covered by such Company Warrants).

(b) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Vested Company Option shall be
canceled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive the payments
specified in Sections 2.6(b) and (c), subject to the provisions of Section
2.11(e) below. At the Effective Time, each outstanding Unvested Company Option
shall be converted into an option to purchase Parent Common Stock
in accordance with this Section 2.11(b) (a " _Parent Option_ ") and a number
of restricted stock units in respect of Parent Common Stock as specified in
Section 2.11(c) below. Each Unvested Company Option so converted shall
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including vesting
schedule and repurchase rights) as set forth in the Company Option Plan and
any agreements thereunder (or if issued other than pursuant to a Company Stock
Option Plan, pursuant to the agreement that governs its issuance) immediately
prior to the Effective Time and, to the extent allowable under applicable Law
and the terms of the Company Option Plan (or such other agreement), except
that (i) each Unvested Company Option shall be exercisable (or shall become
exercisable in accordance with its terms) for that number of whole shares of
Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares that were
issuable upon exercise of such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Up-Front Exchange Ratio, rounded down to
the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) the per
share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of such Unvested Company Option so converted shall be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock at which such Unvested Company Option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Up-Front Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the
nearest whole cent. Continuous employment with the Company or any Subsidiary
shall be credited to the optionee for purposes of determining the vesting of
all converted Unvested Company Options after the  



 

16  Effective Time. In addition to the foregoing, Parent shall assume the
Company Option Plan, and the number and kind of shares of Company Capital
Stock available for issuance under the Company Option Plan shall be converted
into shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of the
Company Option Plan.

(c) At the Effective Time, each outstanding Unvested Company Option shall also
be deemed to be converted into the right to acquire or receive benefits
measured by the value (as of the third trading date immediately preceding the
Closing Date) of the number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the
product (rounded down to the nearest whole number) of (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the Company Option holders
Pro Rata Portion (solely with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
covered by such Unvested Company Option) of the maximum potential Contingent
Payments specified in Section 9.1(a); _provided_ that for purposes of this
Section 2.11(c), "maximum potential Contingent Payments" shall be determined
by reflecting any reductions pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(iii)(A). Such rights
shall be divided into " _SQ Formulation Milestone RSUs_ " in respect of the SQ
Formulation Milestone Payment and " _Registration Study Milestone RSUs_ " in
respect of the Registration Study Milestone Payment in proportion to the
maximum potential Contingent Payment attributable to each such Contingent
Payment. The SQ Formulation Milestone RSUs and the Registration Study
Milestone RSUs shall vest in accordance with the terms set forth in the
subsections of Section 9.1 relevant to each Contingent Payment, being voided
and of no further effect in proportion to the amount by which the relevant
Contingent Payment that is due under Section 9.1(a), as adjusted pursuant to
Section 9.1(b), is less than the maximum potential Contingent Payment
specified in the relevant portion of Section 9.1(a), and the remainder of such
RSUs which have not been so voided shall only vest if the former holder of
such Unvested Company Option is an employee of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries at the time such
Contingent Payment is payable; _provided_ that the ability to earn such
Contingent Payment has not otherwise terminated in accordance with Section
9.1(b)(i) and subject to the provisions of Section 2.11(c) in the Company
Disclosure Schedule.

(d) The Company shall take all necessary steps to cause that, by virtue of the
Merger, all repurchase rights the Company holds relating to shares of Company
Common Stock acquired through the exercise of Company Options shall be held by
the Surviving Corporation following the Merger or assigned to Parent and that
such repurchase rights relate to the Merger Consideration received in respect
of such shares of Company Common Stock.

(e) At the Effective Time, with no further action required on the part of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or any holder thereof,
each outstanding Vested Company Option and Unit shall only entitle the holder
thereof, as applicable, to receive the amounts provided for in Section 2.6
with respect to holders of Vested Company Options or Units, as applicable.
After the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent (as Parent shall determine in its sole
discretion) to (i) deliver the amounts provided for in Section 2.6(b) with
respect to holders of Vested Company Options to such holders of Vested Company
Options (solely with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock covered by
such Vested Company Option) and shall, at the time and in the manner set
forth in Section 9.1, deliver to each such holder of Vested Company Options
such  



 

17  persons applicable Pro Rata Portion of any Contingent Payment to be paid as
provided in Section 2.6(c) (solely with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock covered by such Vested Company Option), and (ii) deliver the
amounts provided for in Section 2.6(b) with respect to holders of Units to
such holders of Units (solely with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock represented by such Unit), as provided in and pursuant to the Bonus
Plan, and shall, at the time and in the manner set forth in Section 9.1,

3.1 _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing, if applicable, under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation. The Company and its Subsidiaries have the requisite corporate
or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate their Assets and to
carry on their business as now being conducted (collectively, the " _Current
Company Business_ "). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly
qualified to do business, and is in good standing (if such concept is
applicable in the relevant jurisdiction) in each jurisdiction where the
operation of the Current Company Business by the Company and its Subsidiaries
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing could not reasonably be expected to result in a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent,  



 

18  materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has
delivered, or made available for review in a data room, to Parent or its
advisors true and correct copies of the respective certificate of
incorporation and bylaws or other equivalent organizational documents, as
applicable, of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, each as in effect as
of the date of this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in violation of any of the provisions of its certificate of incorporation
or bylaws or equivalent organizational documents. As of the date of this
Agreement, (i) the Company has no Subsidiaries other than those listed in
Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (ii) the Company does not
directly or indirectly own any material equity or similar interest in, or any
interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any material equity
or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other
business association or entity. Section 3.1 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a correct and complete list of each jurisdiction where the
Company and/or each of its Subsidiaries is organized and/or qualified to do
business.

3.2 _Authority_. The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority
to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the Merger. The affirmative
vote or consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of Company Common
Stock and 66 2/3 percent of the shares of Company Preferred Stock (voting
together as a single class on an as-converted basis) outstanding on the record
date chosen for purposes of determining the stockholders of the
Company entitled to vote on the approval of this Agreement is the only vote
of the holders of any Company Capital Stock necessary under Delaware Law to
approve this Agreement and the Merger (the " _Required Stockholder Vote_ ").
On or prior to the date of this Agreement, each holder of Company Capital
Stock who is executing a Voting Agreement in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit A_ (collectively, the " _Voting Agreements_ ") has executed a
written consent with respect to all shares of Company Capital Stock held by
such holder, approving this Agreement and the Merger, and as a result, the
Required Stockholder Vote has been obtained and no other corporate proceedings
are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby (other than the filing and recordation
of the Certificate of Merger and such other documents as required by Delaware
Law). As a result of the Companys receipt of all required stockholder
approvals immediately following the execution and delivery hereof, the Merger
has been approved by the Companys stockholders in accordance with Delaware
Law and California Law. The Board of Directors of the Company has unanimously
(i) declared that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this

Agreement and the Merger be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for
their adoption and approval by written consent, and (iv) resolved to recommend
that the stockholders of the Company vote in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the Merger. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming that this Agreement
constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the other parties hereto, this
Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other
similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally and general
principles of equity, regardless of whether asserted in a proceeding in equity
or at law. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does
not  



 

19  constitute, and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not result in, a termination, or breach or violation
by the Company of, or a default by the Company under (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both), (a) any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, as amended, (b) any Material Contract
or (c) any Law applicable to the Company or any of its Assets, except in the
case of clause (b) where such termination, breach, violation or default could
not reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect or
Parent Material Adverse Effect. No material consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any court,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental authority or
instrumentality (each, a " _Governmental Entity_ ") is required to be
obtained or made by the Company at or prior to the Effective Time in order for
the Company to execute and deliver this Agreement or to consummate the Merger,
except for: (a) the filing of the Certificate of Merger as provided in

adjustments) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered.

agreement by or with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries is in force
for the extension of time for the payment, collection or assessment of any

Companys knowledge, there are no facts or basis upon which any such claim
could reasonably be made. Each deficiency resulting from any completed audit

the face of the balance sheet contained in such audited financial statements.

or similar agreements or rulings have been entered into or issued by any

involving consideration to the consultant in excess of $25,000 per year, in
each case, for active, retired or former employees, directors or consultants,
in each case, which is currently sponsored, maintained, contributed to, or

is borne by the Company or its Subsidiaries and any trade or
business (whether or not incorporated) that is or at any relevant time was
treated as a single employer with the Company within the meaning of Section
414 of the Code (an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ") (collectively, the " _Company
Employee Plans_ "). Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
separately lists, as of the date of this Agreement, each Company Employee Plan
that is currently in effect and that has been adopted or maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, whether formally or informally, for the benefit
of employees outside the United States (collectively, the " _Company
International Employee Plans_ "). Neither the Company nor, to the knowledge of
the Company, any other person or entity, has made any commitment to modify,
change or terminate any Company Employee Plan, other than with respect to a
modification, change or termination required by ERISA or the Code. There are
no loans by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any of their officers,
employees, contractors or directors outstanding on the date hereof, except
pursuant to loans under any Company Employee Plan intended to qualify under
Section 401(k) of the Code, and there have never been any loans by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries subject to Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System as from time to time in effect and any
successor to all or a portion thereof establishing margin requirements. 

(b) _Documents_. The Company has delivered to Parent or its advisors (or made
available in a data room for review by Parent or its advisors) true and
complete copies of each of the Company Employee Plans and related material
plan documents, including trust documents, group annuity contracts, plan
amendments, insurance policies or contracts, participant agreements, employee
booklets, administrative service agreements, summary plan descriptions,
compliance and nondiscrimination tests (including 401(k) and 401(m) tests) for
the last three plan years, standard COBRA forms and related notices,
registration statements and prospectuses and, to the extent still in its
possession, any material employee communications relating thereto. With
respect to each Company Employee Plan that is subject to ERISA reporting
requirements, the Company has made available in a data room for review by
Parent or its advisors copies of the annual reports (Form 5500 or 990 series
and all schedules attached  



 

33  thereto) filed for the last five plan years (and, if such report is a Form
5500R, the two most recent Forms 5500C filed with respect to such Company
Employee Plan). The Company has made available in a data room for review by
Parent or its advisors the most recent Internal Revenue Service determination
or opinion letter issued with respect to each such Company Employee Plan. The
Company has made available in a data room for review by Parent or its
advisors all filings made by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company
with any Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Employee Plan to the
extent relevant to any ongoing obligation or liability of the Company,
including any filings under the IRS Employee Plans Compliance Resolution
System Program or any of its predecessors or the Department of Labor
Delinquent Filer Program.

(c) _Compliance_. Each Company Employee Plan is being, and has been,
administered substantially in accordance with its terms and complies in all
material respects with and is being, and has been, administered substantially
in material compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes, rules and regulations (including ERISA and the Code). The Company
and each ERISA Affiliate are not in material default under or material
violation of, and have no knowledge of any material default or material
violation by any other party to, any of the Company Employee Plans. Any
Company Employee Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has either obtained from the Internal Revenue Service a favorable opinion
or determination letter as to its qualified status under the Code, including
all currently effective amendments to the Code, and the corresponding related
exemption of its trust from U.S. federal income taxation under Section 501(a)
of the Code, or has applied to the Internal Revenue Service for such favorable
determination letter within the remedial amendment period under Section
401(b) of the Code, each VEBA has been determined by the Internal Revenue
Service to be exempt from U.S. federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely
to result in the loss of such qualifications of any such Company Employee
Plan. None of the Company Employee Plans promises or provides retiree medical
or other retiree welfare benefits to any person, except for the provision of
continued health coverage under COBRA. The Company has not engaged in, or
participated in, any transaction which would be considered a non-exempt
"prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code and, to the Companys knowledge, no other third-
party fiduciary and/or party-in-interest has engaged in any such "prohibited
transaction" with respect to any Company Employee Plan. Neither the Company
nor any ERISA Affiliate is subject to any liability or penalty under Sections
4976 through 4980 of the Code or Title I of ERISA with respect to any Company
Employee Plan. All contributions required to be made by the Company or any
ERISA Affiliate to any Company Employee Plan have been timely paid and
accrued on the Company Balance Sheet, if required under GAAP. With respect to
each Company Employee Plan, no "reportable event" within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the thirty (30) day
notice requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of
ERISA) has occurred, and no event described in Section 4062, 4063 or 4041 of
ERISA has occurred. Each Company Employee Plan subject to ERISA has prepared
in good faith and timely filed all requisite governmental reports, which were
true and correct in all material respects as of the date filed, and has
properly and timely filed and distributed or posted all notices and reports
to employees required to be filed, distributed or posted with respect to each
such Company Employee Plan unless the failure to do so is not material. No
suit, administrative proceeding or  



 

34  action has been brought or, to the knowledge of the Company, is overtly
threatened in communication with the Company, against or with respect to any
such Company Employee Plan, except for routine claims for benefits, including
any audit or inquiry by the Internal Revenue Service, the United States
Department of Labor, the United States Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
or the United States Department of Health and Human Services. There has been
no amendment to, or written interpretation or announcement by, the Company or
any ERISA Affiliate regarding any Company Employee Plan that would materially
increase the expense of maintaining such Company Employee Plan above the
level of expense incurred with respect to that Plan for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 2005. None of the Assets of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
is, or may reasonably be expected to become, the subject of any Lien arising
under Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412(n) of the Code. All contributions
and payments to Company Employee Plans are deductible under Section 162 or 404
of the Code. No assets of any Company Employee Plan are subject to a material
amount of Tax as unrelated business taxable income under Section 511 of the
Code, and no excise Tax could be imposed upon the Company under Chapter 43 of
the Code. With respect to the Company Employee Plans, no event has occurred
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there exists no condition or set of
circumstances in connection with which the Company would reasonably expect to
be subject to any material liability (other than for liabilities with respect
to routine benefit claims) under the terms of, or with respect to, such
Company Employee Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law.

(d) _No Title IV or Multiemployer Plan_. Neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or
contributed to, or is obligated to materially contribute to, or otherwise
incurred any obligation or liability (including any contingent liability)
under, any "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or any
"employee pension benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) subject
to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code. Neither Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has, as of the date of this Agreement, any actual or potential
withdrawal liability (including any contingent liability) for any complete or
partial withdrawal (as defined in Sections 4203 and 4205 of ERISA) from any
multiemployer plan.

(e) _No Self-Insured Plans_. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has
ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in or contributed to any
self-insured plan that is governed by ERISA and that provides benefits
to employees (including any such plan pursuant to which a stop-loss policy or
contract applies).

(f) _COBRA, FMLA, HIPAA, Cancer Rights_. With respect to each Company
Employee Plan, the Company is in material compliance with (i) the applicable
health care continuation and notice provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (" _COBRA_ ") and the regulations
thereunder or any state Law governing health care coverage extension or
continuation; (ii) the applicable requirements of the Family and Medical Leave
Act of 1993 and the regulations thereunder; (iii) the applicable requirements
of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (" _HIPAA_
"); and (iv) the applicable requirements of the Cancer Rights Act of 1998. The
Company has no material unsatisfied obligations to any employees, former
employees or qualified beneficiaries pursuant to COBRA  



 

35  or pursuant to HIPAA or any state Law governing health care coverage
extension or continuation.

(g) _Section 409A_. Each Company Employee Plan which is a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has
been operated and maintained in a good faith effort to comply in all material
respects according to the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code.

(h) _Effect of Transaction_. Except as set forth in Section 3.19(h) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the Merger will not (i)
entitle any current or former employee or other service provider of Company or
any ERISA Affiliate to severance benefits or any other payment (including
unemployment compensation, golden parachute, bonus or benefits under any
Company Employee Plan); (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting of any
such benefits or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee or
service provider; (iii) result in the forgiveness of any indebtedness; (iv)
result in any obligation to fund future benefits under any Company Employee
Plan; or (v) result in the imposition of any restrictions with respect to the
amendment or termination of any of the Company Employee Plans. Following
the Companys compliance with Section 6.11 of this Agreement, no amount that
could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property), as
a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any
Subsidiary who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G1) under any Company Employee Plan or
otherwise will be an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(1) of the Code). Each Company Employee Plan can be amended, terminated
or otherwise discontinued after the Effective Time in accordance with its
terms, without material liability to Parent or the Company other than
ordinary administration expenses typically incurred in a termination event.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
contract, agreement, plan or arrangement, including but not limited to the
provisions of this Agreement, covering any employee or former employee of the
Company or its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to the payment of any material amount that
would be subject to the deductibility limits of Section 404 of the Code.

(j) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary sponsors, contributes to or has any
liability with respect to any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
that provides benefits to nonresident aliens with no United States source
income outside of the United States.

(k) With respect to each Company Employee Plan that is an "employee welfare
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, other than any
health care reimbursement plan under Section 125 of the Code, all claims
incurred (including claims incurred but not reported) by employees, former
employees and their dependents thereunder for which the Company is, or will
become, liable are (i) insured pursuant to a contract of insurance whereby
the insurance company bears any risk of loss with respect to such claims, (ii)
covered under a contract with a health maintenance organization (an " _HMO_ ")
pursuant to which the HMO bears the liability for such claims, or (iii)
reflected as a liability or accrued for  



 

36  on the Companys consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2005.

3.20 _Employee and Labor Matters_.

(a) No work stoppage or labor strike against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by employees, temporary employees, consultants or independent
contractors is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is delinquent in
payments to any of its employees, temporary employees, consultants or
independent contractors for any wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses or other
direct compensation for any services performed for it or amounts required to
be reimbursed to such persons. Each of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is in substantial compliance with all applicable Laws respecting
labor, employment, fair employment practices (including, but not limited to,
equal employment opportunity laws), terms and conditions of employment,
workers compensation, occupational safety and health, affirmative action,
employee privacy, plant closings, and wages and hours. The Company and each
of its Subsidiaries has withheld all amounts required by Law or by agreement
to be withheld from the wages, salaries and other payments to employees,
temporary employees, consultants and independent contractors, and is not
liable for any arrears of wages or any Taxes or any penalty for failure to
comply with any of the foregoing. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is liable for any payment to any trust or other fund or to any
Governmental Entity, with respect to unemployment compensation benefits,
social security or other benefits or obligations for employees (other than
routine payments to be made in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice). Except as set forth in Section 3.20 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no pending claims against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under any workers compensation plan or policy or for long-term
disability, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject
to, is a party to, or, to the knowledge of the Company, has been threatened
with any action, proceeding, dispute, grievance, arbitration, investigation
before any Governmental Entity, charge or lawsuit relating to labor or
employment matters involving any current or former employees, consultants or
temporary employees, including but not limited to, matters involving labor,
employment, fair employment practices (including, but not limited to, equal
employment opportunity laws), terms and conditions of employment,
occupational safety and health, affirmative action, employee privacy, plant
closings and wages and hours. There are no controversies pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and any of their respective current or former employees,
temporary employees, consultants or independent contractors, which
controversies have or would reasonably be expected to result in an action,
proceeding, dispute, grievance, arbitration, investigation before any
Governmental Entity, charge or lawsuit. To the Companys knowledge, as of the
date hereof, no employees, temporary employees, consultants or independent
contractors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are in any respect in
violation of any term of any employment contract, non-disclosure agreement,
noncompetition agreement or any restrictive covenant to a former employer
relating to the right of any such employee to be employed by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries because of the nature of the business previously
or presently conducted by the Company or such Subsidiary or to the use of
trade secrets or proprietary information of others.



 

37 (b) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or otherwise
bound by any collective bargaining contract with a labor union or labor

respecting any of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
and, to the knowledge of the Company, there are no campaigns being conducted
to solicit cards from employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
authorize representation by any labor union or labor organization.

(c) Any persons now or heretofore engaged by the Company or its Subsidiaries
as independent contractors, rather than employees, have been properly
classified as such, are not entitled to any compensation or benefits to which
regular, full-time employees are or were at the relevant time entitled and
were and have been engaged in accordance with all applicable Laws in all
respects. There has never been, and there is no pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company, threatened, claim, lawsuit, audit, investigation or
arbitration that has been asserted or instituted against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries by any Governmental Entity or any individual relating to
the legal status or classification of an individual classified by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries as a non-employee (such as an independent
contractor, a leased employee, a consultant or special consultant).

insured, (b) the policy number, (c) the period, scope and amount of coverage,
(d) the premium charged and (e) all material claims made under each policy,
whether paid or unpaid as of the date hereof, since the Company Balance Sheet
Date. The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of
all such policies. All insurance policies maintained by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries cover such risks as are in accordance with normal industry
practice for companies with similar operations and subject to comparable
perils or hazards. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
material breach or default (including any such breach or default with respect
to the payment of premiums or the giving of notice under any such policy),
and no event has occurred which, with notice or lapse of time, would
constitute such breach or default, or permit termination or modification,
under the policy. At no time has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries been
denied any insurance or indemnity bond coverage which it has requested.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received notice from any
of its insurance carriers that any insurance coverage listed in Section 3.21
of the Company Disclosure Schedule will not be available in the future
substantially on the same terms as are now in effect.

3.22  _Compliance With Laws_. The businesses of each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have not been, and are not being, conducted in violation of any
Laws in any material respect. No investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or,
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, nor to the Companys
knowledge has any Governmental Entity indicated an intention to conduct the
same. No change is required in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
processes, Assets or procedures in order to bring them into material
compliance with any Laws, and the Company has not received any written notice
or communication of any noncompliance with any applicable  



 

38  Laws that has not been cured as of the date hereof. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries has all material permits, licenses, franchises,

and approvals necessary under applicable Law to conduct its business as
presently conducted and is in compliance therewith.

or any transaction contemplated hereby. Prior to the date hereof, the Company
has furnished Parent with copies of the engagement letter, indemnification

of any oral agreements or understandings it has with Lehman Brothers, Inc. in
connection with the Merger, this Agreement or any transaction contemplated

Company or its Subsidiaries, has directly or indirectly, on behalf of the
Company or its Subsidiaries made any contribution, gift, bribe, rebate,
payoff, influence payment, kickback or other payment to any entity or person,
private or public, regardless of form, whether in money, property or services
in material violation of any federal, state, local or foreign Law.

3.25 _Minute Books_. The minute books of the Company have been made available
in a data room for review by Parent or its advisors and contain a materially
complete and accurate summary of all meetings of directors and stockholders or
actions by written consent since the time of incorporation of the Company

delivered to Parent (or made available in a data room for review by Parent),
other than documents that have been redacted to comply with confidentiality or
similar contractual obligations thereunder, is a true and complete copy of
each such document, and in each case where a representation and warranty of
the Company in this Agreement requires the listing of documents and
agreements, a true and complete copy of all such documents and agreements has
been delivered to Parent (or made available in a data room for review by
Parent).

3.27 _Payments Subject to Code Section 280G_. Set forth in Section 3.27 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule is (a) the estimated maximum amount that could
be paid to each disqualified individual (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G1, and hereafter referred to as a " _Disqualified
Individual_ ") in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under all employment, severance and
termination agreements, other compensation arrangements and Company Employee
Plans currently in effect, assuming that the individuals employment with the
Company is terminated immediately after the Effective Time, (b) the grant
dates, exercise prices and vesting schedules applicable to each Company
Option granted to the individual, (c) the "base amount" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such individual as of the date of this

"excess parachute payments" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code)
(including any taxes, interest or penalties imposed with respect to the excise
tax).

certificate of incorporation and bylaws is applicable to any share of Company
Capital Stock, the Company Warrants, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The board of directors of the Company has
taken all action so that neither Parent nor Merger Sub will be prohibited from
entering into a "business combination" with the Company as an "interested

Law) as a result of the execution of this Agreement, or the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to file, by no later than

47  generality of the foregoing, Each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause to be prepared and filed, by no later than
the fifth business day following the date of this Agreement, the
notifications required under HSR in connection with the Merger. Parent and the
Company shall respond as promptly as practicable to (i) any inquiries or
requests received from the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of
Justice for additional information or documentation and (ii) any inquiries or
requests received from any state attorney general or other Governmental Entity
in connection with antitrust or related matters. Each of the Company (to the
extent it has knowledge of such facts) and Parent shall (A) give the other
party prompt notice of the commencement of any legal proceeding by or before
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (B) keep the other party informed
as to the status of any such legal proceeding; and (C) promptly inform the
other party of any communication to or from the Federal Trade Commission, the
Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity regarding the Merger.
The Company and Parent will consult and cooperate with one another, and will
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with
any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion
or proposal made or submitted by either of them in connection with any legal
proceeding under or relating to HSR or any other foreign, federal or state
antitrust, anticompetition or fair trade Law.

(c) Neither the Company nor Parent shall have any obligation under this
Section 6.3 to take, or commit to take, any of the following actions before
or after the Closing: (i) dispose of or transfer, or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to dispose of or transfer, any IP Rights or material Assets; (ii)
discontinue or cause any of its Subsidiaries to discontinue offering any
product or service; (iii) license or otherwise make available, or cause any of
its Subsidiaries to license or otherwise make available, to any person, any
technology or other IP Rights; or (iv) hold separate or cause any of its
Subsidiaries to hold separate any IP Rights, Assets or operations.

6.4  _Employees_.

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing on the Effective Time and
ending on the last day of the year during which the Closing occurs, the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time (the "
_Company Employees_ ") will continue to be provided benefits that are not
materially less favorable in the aggregate than those provided as of the date
hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Company Employees under the
Companys "employee welfare benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA
and "employee pension benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA.
With respect to each benefit plan, program, practice, policy or arrangement
maintained by Parent or a subsidiary of Parent in which Company Employees
subsequently participate (the " _Parent Plans_ "), for purposes of
determining eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for
severance benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of pension
benefits), service with the Company or a Subsidiary (or predecessor employers
to the extent the Company or a Subsidiary provides past service credit) shall
be treated as service with Parent; _provided_ that such service shall not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in a duplication
of benefits or to the extent that such service was not recognized under the
applicable Company Employee Plan. Parent shall use reasonable efforts to cause
to be waived any waiting periods, evidence of  



 

48  insurability requirements or the application of any pre-existing condition
limitations under any Parent Plans. Company Employees shall be given credit
for amounts paid under a similar Company Employee Plan during the plan year
that includes the Effective Time for purposes of applying deductibles, co-
payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had been paid in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent Plan for the plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs. In the case of any former employee of the
Company and any of their eligible dependents who are receiving health care
contribution coverage under COBRA, Parent agrees to maintain in effect health
care contribution coverage for such former employees and eligible dependents
for the duration of the applicable COBRA contribution period if such persons
otherwise qualify for benefits. Nothing in this Section 6.4 is intended to
(1) be treated as an amendment to any particular Company Employee Plan, (2)
prevent Parent from terminating any of its benefit plans in a manner that does
not affect the vested or other pre-existing rights of any Company Employee,
or (3) give any third party the right to enforce any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

(b) If requested by Parent at least five days prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall terminate any and all Company Employee Plans intended to
qualify under Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests
that such 401(k) plan(s) be terminated, the Company shall provide Parent with
evidence that such 401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to resolution
of the Companys Board of Directors (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent) not later than the day immediately
preceding the Effective Time.

(c) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any Company Employee, any beneficiary or dependent thereof, or any
collective bargaining representative thereof, with respect to the
compensation, terms and conditions of employment and/or benefits that may be
provided to any employee of the Company by Parent or the Surviving Corporation
or under any benefit plan which Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
maintain.

(d) Between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company
shall use its best efforts to assist Parent in entering into Parents standard
"on-boarding" documents with each of the Company Employees, which documents
will be effective at the Effective Time and shall include (i) at will
agreements, (ii) proprietary information and inventions agreements and (iii)
mutual agreements to arbitrate claims.

(e) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Entity and its other Subsidiaries to, credit to Company Employees the amount
of vacation time that such Company Employees had accrued under any applicable
Company Employee Plan as of the Effective Time, subject to the cap on vacation
accrual set forth in Parents vacation policy; _provided_ that the accrued
vacation time of each such Company Employee in excess of such cap shall be
paid as soon as practicable to such Company Employee at the Company Employees
compensation rate in effect as of the Effective Time.

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall terminate those certain
consulting agreements set forth in Section 6.4(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

Parent: (a) a statement conforming to the requirements of Section

notification to the Internal Revenue Service required under Section
1.897-2(h)(2) of the United States Treasury Regulations.

6.6 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors of the Company and its
Subsidiaries_. 

(a) For a period of six years from and after the Closing Date, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify (including
the advancement of expenses) and hold harmless all past and present officers
and directors of the Company to the same extent such individuals are entitled
to indemnification by the Company pursuant to the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, the equivalent organization
documents of its Subsidiaries, employment agreements and/or indemnification
agreements, each as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, and to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, for any costs or expenses
(including attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, Losses, claims,
settlements, damages or Liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to acts or
omissions that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time. This Section 6.6
shall survive the consummation of the Merger, and is intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, all past and present officers and
directors of the Company, their respective heirs and personal representatives
and shall be binding upon Parent and the Surviving Corporation. The
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 6.6
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any indemnitee to whom this Section 6.6 applies without the express written
consent of such affected indemnitee.

(b) If Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their Assets and IP
Rights to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.6.

under this Section 6.6 shall be in addition to any rights such individual may
have under the Companys Organizational Documents or under any applicable Law.

of the Company, their respective heirs and representatives, in each case,
subject to this Section 6.6.

executive officers and directors shall, and the Company shall direct and use

otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any acquisition, merger,
sale or license of IP Rights or substantial Assets, sale of controlling
interest  



 

50  in the Company through a sale or issuance of Company Capital Stock or

Company shall, and the Company shall direct and use reasonable best efforts to
cause its agents and representatives not to, directly or indirectly, engage
in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or
data to, or have any discussions with, any person relating to a Company
Acquisition Proposal, or otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make
or implement a Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly if any such inquiries, proposals or offers are received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated with, it or any of its representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such person and a summary of the
material terms and conditions of any proposals, offers or inquiries. The
Company shall direct and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each of
its Affiliates, investors and the representatives immediately to terminate any
and all discussions or negotiations, with any third party with respect to,
or any that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition
Proposal.

to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each
of Parent and the Company and its board of directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

be true and correct in all material respects and shall be prepared in
accordance with the most recent Tax practices as to elections and

administrative or judicial proceeding with respect to the determination,

sole right to control the representation of the Companys or any Subsidiarys
interests in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to
Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and to employ counsel of its

participate at its expense in any such proceeding, subject to the control of
Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be entitled to settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim
for Taxes relating to Tax periods ending on or before the Closing Date which
may materially affect the Tax liabilities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, for which the Former
Securityholders would be required to indemnify Parent without the prior
written consent of the Stockholders Agent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Stockholders Agent shall be entitled to
participate at its expense in the defense of any claim for Taxes for a Tax
period ending after the Closing Date which may be the subject of

would not be deductible pursuant to Section 280G of the Code if the 280G
Shareholder Vote fails the approval requirements set out in Section
280G(b)(5) of the Code and the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder.
Prior to providing the Companys shareholders with any materials necessary to
comply with such requirements, the Company shall provide a copy of
such materials to Parent in sufficient time to allow Parent to comment
thereon and shall consider any such comments in good faith. If the 280G
Shareholder Vote fails to achieve the requisite approval in respect of any
Disqualified Individual, the Company shall provide to Parent the name of such
Disqualified Individuals and amounts waived.

57  more partners or members of such Former Securityholder or to one or more
Affiliates of such Former Securityholder, and neither Parent, the
Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent, nor the Stockholders Agent shall
give no effect to any purported assignment or transfer made in contravention
of this sentence. Parent shall have no obligation to any former holder of
Unvested Company Options other than to comply with the matters set forth in
Section 2.11(c) of this Agreement.

(iii) _Adjustments_. 

(A) In the event that (1) the Company does not procure and furnish Parent
with, by no later than four business days prior to the Closing Date, that
certain instrument described in the first paragraph of Section 9.1(b)(iii) of
the Company Disclosure Schedules or (2) the Company does not comply with the
matters set forth in the second paragraph of Section 9.1(b)(iii) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules, then: (x) the SQ Formulation Milestone Payment
shall be reduced by the amount of $10,000,000, and (y) the Registration Study
Milestone Payment shall be reduced by the amount of $20,000,000; _provided_
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the reductions to the Milestones set forth in this paragraph (iii)(A) shall
constitute Parents sole remedy in the event of the Companys failure to
perform its covenants under clauses (1) of (2) of this paragraph (iii)(A).

(B) In addition, any Contingent Payment that is payable following the
completion of a Milestone shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of (1) any
claims for indemnification or reimbursement pursuant to Section 9.2 of this
Agreement, (2) any Specified Transactional Expenses (whether or not set forth
on the Expense Statement), (3) any Stockholders Agent Costs payable under
Section 9.3(b), and (4) any fees and expenses of the Paying Agent, in each
case, not otherwise deducted from the Up-Front Payment or any prior
Contingent Payment (for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that the amount
of a particular Contingent Payment is insufficient to offset any Parent Claim
(as defined below), the undeducted excess of such amounts shall be carried
forward and deducted from the next Contingent Payments in the manner provided
herein) (the amounts subject to clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4), together, the "
_Parent Claims_ "), that have been made as of the fifth business day prior to
the payment date of a Contingent Payment; for the avoidance of doubt, the
amounts set forth in paragraph (iii)(A) above and clauses (2), (3) and (4) of
this paragraph (iii)(B) shall not be subject to the Basket Amount set forth
in Section 9.2 of this Agreement.

(C) Within 30 business days following the final determination of all
outstanding Parent Claims for which a Contingent Payment was reduced pursuant
to Section 9.1(b), Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Pro Rata
Portions of the difference between the amount by which the Contingent Payment
was reduced for Parent Claims and the amount of the Parent Claims as finally
determined to each Former Securityholder in the manner set forth in Section
9.1(b)(ii) and comply with the matters set forth in Section 2.11(c) with
respect to former holders of Unvested Company Options.

(D) Subject to the provisions of Section 9.2(e)(ii) of this Agreement: (1)
the Stockholders Agent shall have five business days from the date of payment
of any Contingent Payment that was reduced by a Parent Claim to accept or
object to all or a portion of such Parent Claim; (2) in the event that the
Stockholders Agent, in good faith,  



 

58  disagrees with all or a portion of the Parent Claim, then the Stockholders
Agent shall deliver to the Company, by no later than the expiration of
such five business day period, written notice of such disagreement, which
notice shall include in reasonable detail its reasons for such disagreement;
(3) if the Stockholders Agent delivers a timely notice, the Stockholders
Agent and Parent shall have five business days from the date of delivery of
the notice to resolve all disputes set forth in the notice; and (4) if the
Stockholders Agent fails to dispute any Parent Claim or any portion thereof
in accordance with the foregoing provisions, then such Parent Claim or any
portion thereof shall be deemed to be finally determined for all purposes
under this Agreement.

(iv) _Miscellaneous_.

(A) If any Milestone occurs prior to the Effective Time, (1) Parent shall not
be obligated to make any Contingent Payment unless the Effective Time occurs,
and (2) the related Contingent Payment will be payable within 30 business days
following the Effective Time.

(B) Following the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates will have the right, in
their sole and absolute discretion, to direct and control the development and
manufacture of the IL6 Avimer, including, but not limited to, the
determination to manufacture the IL6 Avimer or pursue any subcutaneous
formulation thereof or make any regulatory filings or seek any regulatory
approvals;  _provided_ that Parent will use reasonable efforts to keep the
Stockholders Agent informed in a timely manner of material decisions,
developments and determinations relating to the Milestones. This Agreement
shall not be construed to impose upon Parent or any of its Affiliates any
express or implied obligation to develop, pursue, test, make any regulatory
filing, seek any regulatory approval or otherwise advance the IL6 Avimer.

9.2 _Indemnification_.

(a) _Survival_. Subject to the provisions of this Section 9.2, each of the
representations, warranties, covenants and obligations in this Agreement shall
survive and continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding the occurrence
of the Closing and the consummation of the Merger. The right of a person to
any remedy pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall not be affected by any
investigation or examination conducted, or any knowledge possessed or
acquired, by such person at any time concerning any circumstance, action,
omission or event relating to the accuracy or performance of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, or by the waiver of any
closing condition contained in this Agreement.

(b) _Indemnification_.

(i) Each Parent Indemnified Party shall be indemnified and reimbursed, by the
Former Securityholders and former holders of Unvested Company Options,
jointly and severally, solely by means of adjustments of the Contingent
Payments (pursuant to Sections 2.11(c) and 9.1(b)(iii) of this Agreement and
as set forth below) and subject to the provisions of this Section 9.2,
from and against any and all Losses asserted against, suffered, sustained,
accrued or incurred by such Parent Indemnified Party in connection with,
arising out of or resulting from (A) any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty made by the  



 

59  Company in or pursuant to this Agreement ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that in
determining whether any such representation or warranty was breached or was
inaccurate, such representation and warranty shall be considered without
regard to any reference to knowledge, materiality or Company Material Adverse
Effect set forth herein) or (B) any failure to perform any covenant
or obligation made by the Company in or pursuant to this Agreement.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party which is
obligated pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(i)(A) to provide indemnification as set
forth herein (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") shall be liable under Section
9.2(b)(i)(A) until the aggregate amounts otherwise due any other party or
parties entitled to indemnification thereunder exceeds $2,000,000 in the
aggregate (the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which case such Indemnifying Party
will be liable to the Parent Indemnified Party(ies) for all of such Losses
including the Basket Amount. The limitation set forth in this first sentence
of this paragraph shall not apply to any Losses incurred in connection with
any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in
Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.5(a), 3.13(b), 3.18 or 3.23.

(c) _Notice_. Any Parent Indemnified Party seeking indemnification
or reimbursement shall provide to the Stockholders Agent a reasonably
detailed written notice of any claims that it may have (a " _Claim Notice_ "),
and in the event that there be asserted against any Parent Indemnified Party
any written claim or demand for which any Parent Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification or reimbursement hereunder (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), the Parent Indemnified Party shall provide to the Stockholders
Agent a Claim Notice with respect thereto within 30 calendar days following
the Parent Indemnified Partys receipt of such claim (and no fewer than ten
calendar days prior to a scheduled appearance date in a litigated matter).
Each Claim Notice shall contain a reasonable estimate of the Losses against
which such Parent Indemnified Party seeks indemnification, to the extent that
such an estimate can be made. The failure to so notify the Stockholders Agent
shall not relieve any Liability that it may have to the Parent Indemnified
Party, except to the extent that the Stockholders Agent or the ability of
such Stockholders Agent to defend against any associated legal action has
been prejudiced thereby.

(d) _Third Party Claims_. With respect to each Third Party Claim that is the
subject of a Claim Notice:

(i) The Parent Indemnified Party and the Stockholders Agent shall keep each
other fully informed concerning the status of such Third Party Claim and any
related proceedings at all stages thereof, and shall render to each other such
assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and shall cooperate
with each other in good faith in order to ensure the proper and adequate
defense of such Third Party Claim. For the avoidance of doubt, all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Parent Indemnified Party in
connection therewith shall be subject to indemnification in accordance with
the terms of Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement.

(ii) The Parent Indemnified Party and the Stockholders Agent shall
use reasonable best efforts to avoid production of confidential information
(consistent with applicable Law and rules of procedure), and to cause all
communications among employees,  



 

60  counsel and other representatives of the Parent Indemnified Party and the
Stockholders Agent to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-
client or work-product privileges.

(iii) Each party hereby consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
any court in which a Third Party Claim is brought for purposes of any claim
for indemnification or reimbursement with respect to such Third Party Claim or
the matters alleged therein, and agrees that process may be served on such
Party with respect to any such claim anywhere in the world.

(e) _Payment_.

(i) To the extent permitted by Law, any payment made by a person indemnifying
an Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 9.2 (any such Indemnified
Party, a " _Payee_ " and any such indemnifying person, a " _Payor_ ") shall be
treated on the parties Tax Returns as an adjustment to the purchase price for
all Tax purposes.

(ii) In the event a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under this
Section 9.2 shall have been finally determined in which the Parent
Indemnified Party is Parent and/or Merger Sub, the amount of the related Loss
shall be paid pursuant to and solely by means of deductions from Contingent
Payments pursuant to Section 9.1(b) and, except for any Loss resulting from
a claim for indemnification or reimbursement based on fraud, neither the
Stockholder Agent, any Former Securityholder nor any former holder of an
Unvested Company Option shall have any responsibility for any Loss resulting
from a claim for indemnification or reimbursement under this Section 9.2
other than by means of adjustment of the Contingent Payments, if any. To the
extent a payment relates to any Loss denominated in a currency other than
United States Dollars, such payment shall be made or deducted in United
States Dollars calculated at the United States Dollar exchange rate in effect
for such currency on the date preceding the date of payment. Any claim,
liability therefor and the amount of the related Losses shall be "finally
determined" when the parties to such claim have so determined by mutual
written agreement or, if disputed, when a final and non-appealable Order of a
court of competent jurisdiction shall have been entered concerning
such matters. If the Stockholders Agent fails to dispute any Loss (other
than Losses related to any Third Party Claim) within the 30 business day
period referred to in Section 9.1(b)(iii), such Loss shall be deemed to be
"finally determined" for all purposes under this Agreement.

(f) _Sole Remedy_. Following the Closing, the indemnification rights provided
in this Section 9.2 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy and the
sole basis for and means of recourse among Parent, the Company, the
Stockholders Agent and the Former Securityholder with respect to any Losses
of any kind or nature (other than Losses caused by fraud) arising out of or
in connection with any breach or alleged breach of any representation,
warranty or covenants contained in this Agreement.

9.3 _Stockholders  Agent_.

(a) By virtue of the approval of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders,
and without further action of any Company stockholder, and by virtue of the
execution of the applicable instrument provided for in Section 2.11(a) of
this Agreement by the  



 

61  former holders of Company Warrants, each Former Stockholder and each former
holder of a Company Warrant (the " _Appointing Former Holders_ ") shall be
deemed to have irrevocably constituted and appointed, or shall irrevocably
constitute and appoint, as the case may be, the Stockholders Agent (and by
execution of this Agreement, the Stockholders Agent hereby accepts
such appointment) as agent and attorney-in-fact for and on behalf of the
Appointing Former Holders, with full power of substitution, to act in the
name, place and stead of each Appointing Former Holder with respect to this
Section 9 and the taking by the Stockholders Agent of any and all actions
and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the
Stockholders Agent under this Agreement, including the exercise of the power
to: (i) give and receive notices and communications under this Section 9;
(ii) object to claims for indemnification and other Parent Claims made by
Parent under this Section 9; (iii) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with respect to claims
for indemnification and other Parent Claims made by Parent under this Section
9; (iv) receive a deposit in the amount of $100,000, to be provided by the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, to hold such funds (the "
_Stockholders Agent s Fund_") in a separate account solely within the
Stockholders Agents control and which need not be interest bearing, to
deduct from the Stockholders Agents Fund the amount of $10,000 per year as
a fee for serving as Stockholders Agent, to use the amounts in the
StockholdersAgents Fund in furtherance of its duties as Stockholders Agent
as it may determine in its good faith discretion and to retain as an
additional fee any amounts remaining in the StockholdersAgents Fund
following the conclusion of its services as Stockholders Agent hereunder; and
(v) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the good faith judgment of
the Stockholders Agent for the accomplishment of the foregoing. The power of
attorney granted in this Section 9.3 by each Appointing Former Holder to the
Stockholders Agent is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable, may be
delegated by the Stockholders Agent and shall survive the death or incapacity
of any Appointing Former Holder. The identity of the Stockholders Agent and
the terms of the agency may be changed, and a successor Stockholders Agent
may be appointed, from time to time (including in the event of the death,
disability or other incapacity of the Stockholders Agent) by the Appointing
Former Holders whose aggregate portion of the Remaining Up-Front Payment
exceeds 50%, and any such successor shall succeed the Stockholders Agent as
Stockholders Agent hereunder. No bond shall be required of the Stockholders
Agent.

(b) The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable for any Liability, Loss,
damage, penalty, fine, cost or expense incurred without gross negligence by
the Stockholders Agent while acting in good faith and in the exercise of its
reasonable judgment and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of his duties hereunder (it being understood that any act done
or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of
such good faith). It shall be a condition of each Appointing Former Holders
right to receive any portion of the Merger Consideration or any other
payment or benefit hereunder that such person execute a document in which
such person shall, in accordance with their Pro Rata Portion, indemnify and
defend the Stockholders Agent and hold the Stockholders Agent harmless
against any Loss, damage, cost, Liability or expense incurred without fraud,
gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Stockholders Agent and arising
out of or in connection with the acceptance, performance or administration of
the Stockholders Agents duties under this Agreement. Any Liabilities,
Losses, penalties, fines, claims, damages, out-of-pocket costs  



 

62  or expenses incurred by or reasonably expected to be incurred by the
Stockholders Agent in connection with the acceptance, performance
and administration of its duties as the Stockholders Agent pursuant to this
Agreement (including the hiring of legal counsel, accountants or auditors and
other advisors pursuant to the terms of this Agreement but excluding any of
the foregoing arising out of the Stockholders Agents fraud, gross
negligence or willful misconduct) (" _Stockholders  Agents Costs_"), shall
be paid as follows: (i) first by recourse to the Stockholders Agents Fund,
(ii) then by recourse to any Contingent Payments as set forth in Section
9.1(b)(ii), and (iii) if such amounts are insufficient to pay such
Stockholders Agents Costs, directly to the Appointing Former Holders
(in proportion to the payments received by such persons under Sections 2.6(a)
and (b) of this Agreement).

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide the Stockholders Agent with reasonable updates about
the Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of the officers and
employees of Parent and the Surviving Corporation for purposes of performing
his duties and exercising his rights under this Agreement; _provided_ that the
Stockholders Agent shall treat confidentially any nonpublic information it
receives from Parent regarding the Surviving Corporation (except in
connection with the performance by the Stockholders Agent of its duties or
the exercise of its rights under this Agreement). Parent (and the Surviving
Corporation) shall have no Liability to any of the Former Securityholders or
former holders of Unvested Company Options or otherwise arising out of the
acts or omissions of the Stockholders Agent or any disputes among the Former
Securityholders or former holders of Unvested Company Options or between the
Former Securityholders or former holders of Unvested Company Options and the
Stockholders Agent. Parent may rely entirely on its dealings with, and
notices to and from, the Stockholders Agent to satisfy any obligations it
might have under this Agreement or otherwise to the Former Securityholders or
former holders of Unvested Company Options.

9.4  _Actions of the Stockholders  Agent_. From and after the Effective
Time, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Agent shall
constitute a decision of all Former Securityholders and all former holders of
Unvested Company Options and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each
Former Securityholder and each former holder of an Unvested Company Option,
and Parent may rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Stockholders Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of
each Former Securityholder and each former holder of an Unvested Company
Option. Parent and the Surviving Corporation are hereby relieved from any
liability to any person for any acts done by Stockholders Agent and any acts
done by Parent or the Surviving Corporation in accordance with any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Agent.

sector as the Company);

apparent from the text of such disclosures.

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement,

10.5 _Entire Agreement; Nonassignability; Parties in Interest_.

(a) This Agreement and the documents and instruments delivered pursuant
hereto, including the exhibits hereto, the Company Disclosure Schedule and
the other schedules hereto:

(i) together constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof, except for the Confidentiality Agreement, both of which
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and
shall survive any termination of this Agreement;

(ii) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies
hereunder, except as provided in clause (b) of this Section 10.5; and

(iii) shall not be assigned by Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or by
the Company, on the other hand (by operation of law or otherwise), without the
written consent of each of the parties hereto (and any purported assignment

indirect Subsidiary of Parent, or an Affiliate of Parent, in lieu of Merger
Sub, in which event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed
references to such other person, except that all representations and
warranties made herein with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this
Agreement shall be deemed representations and warranties made with respect to
such other person as of the date of such substitution.

(b) Except as provided in Section 6.6, this Agreement is not intended to, and
does not, confer upon any person other than the parties who are signatories
hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. The parties hereto further agree that
the rights of third-party beneficiaries under Section 6.6 shall not arise
unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

10.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof becomes, or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement, and the application of such provision to other persons or
circumstances other than those as to which it is determined to be illegal,
void or unenforceable, will not be impaired or otherwise affected and will
continue in full force and effect and be enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by Law.

10.7 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.2(c) or
elsewhere herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a
party will be deemed cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

10.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
parties residing in the State of Delaware, without regard to applicable
principles of conflicts of law. Each of the parties irrevocably consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any Delaware State court, or Federal
court of the United States of America, sitting in Delaware, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in connection with any matter based upon or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and agrees
that process may be served upon it in any manner authorized by the Laws of
the State of Delaware for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert
or plead any objection which it might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and
such process. Each of the parties irrevocably waives the right to trial by
jury in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

10.9 _Rules of Construction_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during
the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore,
waive the application of any Law, holding or rule of construction providing
that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against
the party drafting such agreement or document.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the masculine gender
shall include  



 

67  the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine gender shall include the
masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender shall include the
masculine and feminine genders.

(c) As used in this Agreement, (i) the words "include" and "including,"
and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but
rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation" and
(ii) the words "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and "hereto" shall be deemed
to refer to this Agreement in its entirety and not to any specific section of
this Agreement.

(d) Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Exhibits" and "Annexes" are intended to refer to Sections of this
Agreement or the Company Disclosure Schedule, as appropriate, and Exhibits
and Annexes to this Agreement.

(e) The headings and subheadings used in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only and shall have no force or effect whatsoever in interpreting
any of the provisions of this Agreement.

10.10 _Time is of the Essence; Enforcement_. Time is of the essence of this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto agrees that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity.

10.11 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any
waiver of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement must be in writing
and must be duly executed by or on behalf of the party to be charged with such
waiver. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, the failure of a
party to exercise any of its rights hereunder or to insist upon strict
adherence to any term or condition hereof on any one occasion shall not be
construed as a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist
upon strict adherence to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at a
