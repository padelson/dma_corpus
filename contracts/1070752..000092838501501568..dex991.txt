SNH is proceeding in good faith), SNH shall give CLJ notice of any matters shown
on the Surveys (other than Permitted Liens) which adversely affect any of the
Properties in any material respect and as to which SNH reasonably objects, and
CLJ shall, within ten Business Days of its receipt of such notice, notify SNH
whether CLJ elects to take such action as may be required to cause such matter
to be remedied. If CLJ elects to remedy the matter objected to by SNH, such
matter shall be remedied at or prior to Closing. If CLJ elects not to remedy
such matter, SNH shall, within five Business Days of its receipt of notice of
CLJ's election not to remedy the matter, elect whether to terminate this
Agreement. If SNH does not so terminate this Agreement, the objected to
exception shall become a Permitted Lien.

thereon which adversely affect any of the Properties in any material respect and
as to which SNH reasonably objects, and CLJ shall, within ten Business Days of
its receipt of such notice, notify SNH whether CLJ elects to take such action as
may be required to cause such matter to be remedied. If CLJ elects to remedy the
matter objected to by SNH, such matter shall be remedied at or prior to Closing,
or, if such matter cannot be completed by Closing, CLJ shall promptly begin such
remediation and diligently pursue completion through and, if necessary, after
Closing. If CLJ elects not to remedy such matter, SNH shall, within five
Business Days of its receipt of notice of CLJ's election not to remedy the

liability. None of CLJ, CSL or any Acquired Company shall take or permit any

treated by the Parties as "distributions" to CLJ for federal income tax purposes
under Sections 301, 857(a)(2), and 857(d)(3) of the Code, and under Treasury
Regulations 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-33. Solely for federal income (and, to the
extent allowable under applicable Law, state and local) tax purposes, such
dividends or other distributions shall not be treated by the Parties as part of
the Purchase Price.

     5.9.   No Solicitation of Other Offers.

     in respect of the Losses indemnified against shall not exceed the Purchase

     7.4. Third Party Claims.
          ------------------

                    (a) Promptly after the receipt by any party hereto of notice
     of any claim, action, suit or proceeding of any third party which is
     subject to indemnification hereunder, such party ("Indemnified Party")
                                                        -----------------
     shall give written notice of such claim to the party obligated to provide
     indemnification hereunder ("Indemnifying Party"), stating the nature and
                                 ------------------
     basis of such claim and the amount thereof, to the extent known. Failure of
     the Indemnified Party to give such notice shall not relieve the
     Indemnifying Party from any liability which it may have on account of its
     indemnification obligation or otherwise, except to the extent that the
     Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby.

                    (b) The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to elect to
     participate in the defense of and, if it so chooses, to assume the defense
     of such claim, action, suit or proceeding with counsel selected by the
     Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
     Upon any such election by the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of
     such claim, action, suit or proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall not be
     liable for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
     Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, provided,
                                                               --------
     however, that (i) if the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded
     -------
     that separate counsel is required because a conflict of interest would
     otherwise exist, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to select
     separate counsel to participate in the defense of such action on its
     behalf, at the expense of the Indemnifying Party and (ii) the Indemnified
     Party may, at its option and at its own expense, participate in such
     defense and employ counsel separate from the counsel

                                      -40-

<PAGE>

     employed by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable
     for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnified
     Party for any period in which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the
     defense thereof (other than during any period in which the Indemnified
     Party failed to give the notice provided above). The parties shall use
     commercially reasonable efforts to minimize Losses from claims by third
     parties and shall act in good faith in responding to, defending against,
     settling or otherwise dealing with such claims, notwithstanding any dispute
     as to liability as between the parties under this Section 7. The parties
                                                       ---------
     shall also cooperate in any such defense, give each other full access to
     all non-privileged information relevant thereto and make employees and
     other representatives available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
     additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder.
     Whether or not the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed the defense, the
     Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified
     Party hereunder for any settlement entered into without the Indemnifying
     Party's prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
     withheld or delayed. Unless the sole relief is monetary damages which are
     payable in full by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not
     settle any claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
     Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

     7.5. Purchase Price Adjustment.
          --------------------------

     Any amount paid by CLJ on the one hand, or SNH on the other hand, to the
other pursuant to this Section 7 will be treated for federal income tax purposes
                       ---------
as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

          2002;

               (ii)  if, by September 15, 2001, HPT shall not have agreed,

          contained in Section 6.2(b) pursuant to an amendment acceptable to
                       --------------
          each of HPT and CLJ;

               (iii) if SNH shall have (i) failed to perform in any material

          individually or in the aggregate, results or could reasonably be
          likely to result in a material adverse effect on the ability of SNH or

Confidentiality Agreement dated as of February 20, 2001 between SNH and CLJ,
each of which shall continue in full force and effect) and constitutes the
entire agreement among the Parties. The failure of any Party at any time or
times to require performance of any provisions of this Agreement shall in no
manner affect the right to enforce the same. No waiver by any Party of any
conditions, or of the breach of any term, provision, warranty, representation,
agreement or covenant contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct or
otherwise, in any one or more instances shall be deemed or construed as a
further or continuing waiver of any such condition or breach of any other term,
provision, warranty, representation, agreement or covenant contained in this
Agreement.

            -------------

     This Agreement is to be construed and enforced in accordance with, and the
rights of the parties shall be governed by, the law of the State of Maryland

of Maryland).

     9.13.  Consent to Jurisdiction.
            ------------------------

     To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Parties absolutely and

connection with any actions or proceedings brought against a Party by any other
Party arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated by this
agreement and hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of any such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Each Party
hereby waives and agrees not to assert in any such action or proceeding, in each
case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any claim that (a) it
is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, (b) it is
immune from any legal process (whether through service or notice, attachment
prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with
respect to it or its property, or (c) any such suit, action or proceeding is
brought in an inconvenient forum in any such action or proceeding. To the

            ------------

jurisdiction will, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of
this Agreement, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction

            ------------
