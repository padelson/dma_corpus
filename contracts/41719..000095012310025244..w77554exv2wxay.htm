commitment letter (the &#147;<B>Commitment Letter</B>&#148;) from Credit Suisse (the &#147;<B>Lender</B>&#148;)

an aggregate amount of up to USD$100,000,000 (the &#147;<B>Debt Financing</B>&#148;). The Commitment
Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect and, as of the date

is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent,
the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, no event has occurred which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or breach on
the part of Parent under the Commitment Letter. The Debt Financing, along with cash
otherwise available to Parent or Buyer at Closing, is sufficient to enable Parent
and Buyer to pay the Purchase Price and to pay any other amounts payable by Parent
or Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies relating to funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing other
than as set forth in the Commitment Letter (including any references to other
agreements as contained therein) and, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor
Buyer has any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing
will not be satisfied or that the Debt Financing or, if applicable, Alternative
Financing, will not be available to Parent and Buyer on the Closing Date.</TD>
