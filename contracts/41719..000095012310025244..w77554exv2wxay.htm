prepared by Buyer in its entirety and the Closing Date Statement shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties.  
      
    | (d)  |   | If any such notice of objections is timely delivered by
Vendor to Buyer in the manner described in Section 2.4(e), any items as to
which there is no disagreement shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties, and Vendor and Buyer shall endeavor in good faith to resolve any
disputed matters set forth in such notice within 30 days (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree in writing) after Buyers receipt of
Vendors notice of objections. If, at the end of  ##### 

 

 

\- 18 -  

       |   |   | such period, Vendor and Buyer are unable to resolve
the disputed matters, (i) if such remaining disputed matters involve an
aggregate disputed amount of $50,000 or more, they shall be referred by
Vendor and Buyer to the Accounting Firm or (ii) if such remaining disputed
matters involve an aggregate disputed amount of less than $50,000, the mid-
point between Vendors and Buyers positions with respect to such disputed
items shall be final, conclusive and binding on the Parties. The Accounting
Firm shall review only those items remaining in dispute and any determination
of the Accounting Firm in respect of each such matter remaining in dispute
shall be final, conclusive and binding on Vendor and Buyer and not subject to
collateral attack for any reason absent manifest error or fraud. The
Accounting Firm shall be instructed that (A) with respect to each disputed
item, the Accounting Firm shall either accept the position taken by Vendor or
the position taken by Buyer and (B) its review shall be limited to
determining whether the Proposed Final Closing Working Capital was calculated
in a manner consistent with the calculation of Target Closing Working Capital
or was arrived at based on mathematical error. The Accounting Firm shall
prepare and deliver to Vendor and Buyer a written report explaining its
determination. The determination of the Accounting Firm shall be based solely
on written submissions by Vendor and Buyer and shall not be based on any
independent review by the Accounting Firm. The Closing Working Capital,
as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4 (whether by failure of
Vendor to deliver notice of objection, by agreement of Vendor and Buyer or by
determination of the Accounting Firm), is referred to herein as the "Final
Closing Working Capital."  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | If the Final Closing Working Capital exceeds the
Estimated Closing Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to Vendor the amount of
such difference with simple interest thereon from the Closing Date to the
date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate at such time
_plus_ 2%. If the Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds the Final Closing
Working Capital, Vendor and Buyer shall, within two Business Days of the
determination of the Final Closing Working Capital pursuant to this
Section 2.4, deliver a joint written notice to the Escrow Agent specifying
the amount of such difference, and the Escrow Agent shall, in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement, pay such amount with simple interest
thereon from the Closing Date to the date of payment at a rate per annum
equal to the Prime Rate at such time plus 2% by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Buyer to the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement;  _provided_ that
to the extent that the amount of the Escrow Fund available for such payment
is less than such amount, the remaining amount of such payment shall be paid
to Buyer by Vendor. Such payment, net of any applicable withholding Tax, shall
be made not later than five Business Days after the determination of the
Final Closing Working Capital by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to a bank account designated in writing to the Party entitled to receive the
payment.  
      
    | (f)  |   | Subject to any applicable privileges (including the
solicitor-client privilege), Buyer shall make available to Vendor and, upon
request, to the Accounting Firm  ##### 

 

 

\- 19 -  

       |   |   | retained in accordance with Section 2.4(d), the
books, records, documents and work papers underlying the preparation of the
Closing Date Statement. Subject to any applicable privileges (including the
solicitor-client privilege), Vendor shall make available to Buyer and, upon
request, to the Accounting Firm retained in accordance with Section 2.4(d)
the books, records, documents and work papers created or prepared by or for
Vendor in connection with the review of the Closing Date Statement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (g)  |   | The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm
shall be paid by the Party whose Closing Working Capital calculation was
different by the greater amount from that of the final determination of the
Accounting Firm.

securityholders. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by or on
behalf of each of Parent and Buyer and, at or prior to the Closing, each of
Parent and Buyer will have duly executed and delivered the Escrow Agreement.
This Agreement is, and the Escrow Agreement, when duly executed and delivered
at Closing by Parent and Buyer, will be, the legal, valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Buyer, as the case may be, enforceable
against Parent and Buyer, as the case may be, in accordance with its
respective terms, provided that enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency and other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally, and
that specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies may
only be granted in the discretion of a court of competent jurisdiction.

be material to Parent and Buyer or would not prevent or materially delay the
consummation by Parent and Buyer of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement.  
      
    | (e)  |   | Buyer is a WTO Investor  
      
    |   |   | Buyer is a "WTO Investor" within the meaning of the

connection with the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and,
accordingly, there is no commission, fee or other remuneration payable, or
other liability incurred, by Parent or Buyer to any broker, underwriter or
agent in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than Credit Suisse. Parent and Buyer, together, are
solely responsible for any fees and expenses of Credit Suisse.  
      
    | (g)  |   | Litigation  
      
    |   |   | There are no Claims by or against Parent or Buyer
pending, or to the knowledge of Parent, threatened to be brought, by or
before any Authority which, if determined adversely to Parent or Buyer,
would, individually or in the aggregate,  #####

       |   |   | have a material adverse effect on Parents and/or
Buyers ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

    | (h)  |   | Sufficiency of Funds  
      
    |   |   | Parent or Buyer has delivered to Vendor a true and
complete copy of an executed commitment letter (the "Commitment Letter") from
Credit Suisse (the "Lender") pursuant to which the Lender has committed to
provide Parent with debt financing in an aggregate amount of up to
USD$100,000,000 (the "Debt Financing"). The Commitment Letter, in the form so
delivered, is in full force and effect and, as of the date hereof, has not
been amended, modified, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect, and is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of
Parent, the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under the Commitment
Letter. The Debt Financing, along with cash otherwise available to Parent or
Buyer at Closing, is sufficient to enable Parent and Buyer to pay the
Purchase Price and to pay any other amounts payable by Parent or Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement. There are no conditions precedent or
other contingencies relating to funding of the full amount of the Debt
Financing other than as set forth in the Commitment Letter (including any
references to other agreements as contained therein) and, as of the date
hereof, neither Parent nor Buyer has any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the Debt Financing will not be satisfied or that the Debt
Financing or, if applicable, Alternative Financing, will not be available to
Parent and Buyer on the Closing Date.  
      
    | (i)  |   | Due Diligence  
      
    |   |   | Parent acknowledges that it has conducted to its
satisfaction an independent investigation of the financial condition,
liabilities, results of operations and projected operations of the Company
and each of its Subsidiaries and the nature and condition of their respective
properties and assets and, in making the determination to proceed with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has relied solely on the results
of its own independent investigation and the representations and warranties
in Section 3.1.  
      
    | (j)  |   | Competition Act  
      
    |   |   | Buyer, together with its affiliates (as such term is
defined under the Competition Act), neither has aggregate assets in Canada,
nor aggregate gross revenues from sales in, from or into Canada, in excess of
$100 million for the purposes of, and in accordance with, the determination
to be made under subsection 109(1) of the Competition Act and the Notifiable
Transactions Regulations thereto.

or proprietary information with respect to the Business, the Company and each
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) in the event that Vendor or any of its

provide Parent and Buyer with prompt written notice of such requirement so
that Parent, Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries may seek a
protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this Section

not disclosed in breach of this Agreement by Vendor or its Representatives;

to obtain (or cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to obtain) all

or become necessary for its execution and delivery of, and the performance of
its obligations pursuant to, this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and will
co-operate fully with the other Parties in promptly seeking to obtain all
such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Without limiting the
generality of Section 5.6, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts
(i) as promptly as practicable, to make or cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to make any filing under applicable German Law
that is necessary to insure that the conditions set forth in Section 4.1(g)
and Section 4.2(d) are satisfied as promptly as practicable, but in any event

    | (b)  |   | Each Party shall, and shall cause its respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, furnish to the other such information and
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary or considered by
Buyer advisable to make under any antitrust, trade regulation, competition,
communications or other Law applicable to this Agreement or which is
otherwise requested by any Authority in the course of any review of

applicable Law and the attorney-client and similar applicable privileges,
each Party shall (i) have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent

      |   |   | communications may be redacted to the extent that
such information reveals Buyers or Vendors negotiating objectives or
strategies or purchase price expectations and (iii) not participate in or
agree to participate in any substantive meeting, telephone call or discussion
with any Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or inquiry
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by the Authority, gives the other Party the opportunity to
attend and participate in such meeting, telephone call or discussion.

    | (c)  |   | As promptly as practicable after the date hereof,

the Material Contracts or make any notices required under the Material
Contracts or the Public Grants, including, in each case, as set forth
on Section 5.8(c) of the Disclosure Letter, in each case in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer. Vendor shall not be required to make any material
payments to any third parties in order to obtain any such consent. Vendor
shall keep Buyer reasonably informed as to the status of obtaining any such
consents. Buyer will not be required to accept or agree or accede to any
consents that modify or amend any of the terms or provisions of any such
Material Contracts in a way that would make, or would be reasonably likely to
make, the underlying Material Contract materially more onerous, or that would
materially reduce or would be reasonably likely to materially reduce
the benefits available under such Material Contract in respect of which the
consent relates.  
   

  

5.9 _Taxation Matters_  

   

       | (a)  |   | Buyer shall prepare and file or cause to be
prepared and filed all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date (with respect to periods beginning
prior to the Closing Date) and shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown
as due on such Tax Returns, all in a manner that is consistent with
applicable Tax Laws and the Companys prior practice and within any
applicable time limits. For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding
Section 5.9(b), at Buyers sole option such Tax Returns may include an
election under subsection 256(9) of the Tax Act (or a comparable election
under analogous provisions of any applicable provincial Tax Laws).  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | No later than 30 days prior to the due date (including
extensions obtained) for the filing of a Tax Return described in Section
5.9(a), Buyer shall make such Tax Return available for review by Vendor to
provide Vendor with an opportunity to comment on such Tax Return. Buyer shall
incorporate all reasonable comments that Vendor may have on such Tax Return
prior to filing; _provided_ that Vendor shall acknowledge its indemnity
obligations with respect to Indemnified Taxes resulting from any increase in
Taxes payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of periods ending
on or before the Closing Date as a result of such comments (and any related
indemnification payment shall be made on or before the due date for the
applicable Tax Return).  
       ##### 

 

 

\- 58 -  

       | (c)  |   | Buyer shall promptly notify Vendor in writing
upon receipt by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of written notice of
any Tax audits, examinations, assessments or reassessments that could give
rise to indemnification under Section 6.1. Vendor, at its expense, shall be
entitled to control the defence of any Claim or audit relating to Taxes that
are indemnified against under Section 6.1 with respect to taxable
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, _provided_ , that Vendor
shall acknowledge its indemnity obligations with respect to the full amount
of any adjustment which may be made as a result of such proceeding (and
provide security reasonably satisfactory to Buyer for any liability that
would arise under Section 6.1 if the Claim were determined adversely to the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and _provided_ , further, that Vendor shall not
agree to settle any such proceeding without the prior written consent of
Buyer (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Buyer may
also participate in any such proceeding at Buyers expense and, if Vendor
does not assume the defence of the proceeding, Buyer may defend the
proceeding in such manner as it may deem appropriate, including the
settlement or compromise thereof.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this
Section 5.9 shall apply with respect to Claims for Taxes and the provisions
of Section 6.3 shall not apply with respect to Claims for Taxes.  
      
    | (e)  |   | Vendor and Buyer shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by, and at the expense of, the other Party, in
connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes relating to taxable periods ending on or
before or that otherwise include the Closing Date. Such co-operation shall
include the retention (as set forth in Section 5.7) and (upon the other
Partys request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant
to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder; _provided_
that in no event shall Buyer be required to provide any Tax Return or other
information of Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries).  
      
    | (f)  |   | Except as required by applicable Law, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing Date, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) shall, without the prior written consent of Vendor
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (i) make or
change any Tax election affecting any taxable period of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries ending on or before the Closing Date other than an election
under Section 338 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or (ii) amend, refile or
otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any applicable statute
of limitations with respect to) any Tax Return prepared by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries relating to a taxable period of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date or (iii) take any action outside
the ordinary course of business that could reasonably be expected to result
in any increased Tax liability (including a reduction in a refund) or
reduction of any Tax asset or attribute of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries   ##### 

 

 

\- 59 - 

      |   |   | (or Vendor) in respect of a taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date or any portions of taxable periods ending on or
prior to the Closing Date as determined under Section 5.10 (but, in each
case, only to the extent it could reasonably be expected to result, directly
or indirectly, in Vendor making an indemnity payment hereunder).  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (g)  |   | If any refund of Taxes (a "Refund") is received by or
credited to the account of Buyer or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
respect of any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date (or portion
thereof as determined under Section 5.10), Buyer shall pay the amount of the
Refund to Vendor, after deduction of an amount equal to the amount of Taxes,
if any, to which the recipient, or any of Buyer or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, would be subject as a result of the receipt or crediting
of such Refund, provided that in the event of a subsequent disallowance or
other reduction of a Refund that has been paid to Vendor pursuant to this
clause (g), Vendor shall promptly pay the amount of the Refund or refund of
Taxes disallowed together with any applicable interest to Buyer.  
   

  

5.10 _Tax Allocation_  

  

For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of a taxable period that begins on
or before, and ends after, the Closing Date, Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be allocated to the portion of the period ending on the
Closing Date as follows: (a) all income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes
and other Taxes that are readily apportionable based on an actual or
deemed closing of the books shall be allocated based on the amount that would
be payable if the taxable year ended on the Closing Date, and (b) all
property and other Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and not
described in clause (a) shall be allocated based on the amount of such Tax for
the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the portion of a period ending on the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the taxable period; _provide_ d
that, in the case of any Taxes determined on an arrears basis, such Taxes
shall be allocated to the taxable period to which such Taxes relate. For
purposes of this Agreement, any Refunds with respect to a taxable period that
begins on or before, and ends after, the Closing Date shall be allocable
based on the manner in which the corresponding Taxes are allocable pursuant
to this Section 5.10. 

   

5.11 _German Real Estate Transfer Tax_  

   

       | (a)  |   | Buyer shall file, within the applicable time
limits, the declaration required under the German Act on Real Estate Transfer
Tax ( _Grunderwerbsteuergesetz_ ) as a result of its execution of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Each of Vendor and Buyer shall pay, within the
applicable time limits, one half of any transfer Taxes assessed as payable
under the German Act on Real Estate Transfer Tax ( _Grunderwerbsteuergesetz_
) as a result of Buyers execution of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, provided that if this Agreement is terminated prior to
Closing in accordance with Article 7 hereof,   ##### 

 

 

\- 60 - 

      |   |   | Buyer shall be entitled to receive one half of any
amounts reimbursed by the German Tax Authorities as a result of such
termination.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | In the event that the amounts payable under Section
5.11(b) are not due prior to the Closing Date, the Purchase Price (and the
amount otherwise required to be paid by Vendor pursuant to Section 5.11(b))
shall be reduced by an amount equal to 50% of the amount shown on the
declaration referred to in Section 5.11(a).  
   

  

5.12 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_  

  

For a period of three years from and after the Closing Date, Vendor shall not,
and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives
not to, directly or indirectly cause, solicit or induce (other than through
general advertising in publications or media of general circulation,
including trade journals and similar media) any executive officer of the
Company or any executive officer of any of the Subsidiaries of the Company to
leave their employment (provided that this Section 5.12 shall not apply to
those individuals set forth on Schedule 5.12 attached hereto). The covenants
and undertakings contained in this Section 5.12 relate to matters which
are of a special, unique and extraordinary character and a violation of any
of the terms of this Section 5.12 will cause irreparable injury to Parent and
Buyer, the amount of which will be impossible to estimate or determine and
which cannot be adequately compensated. Accordingly, the remedy at law for
any breach of this Section 5.12 will be inadequate. Therefore, Parent and
Buyer will be entitled to a temporary and permanent injunction, restraining
order or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in
the event of any breach of this Section 5.12 without the necessity of proving
actual damage or posting any bond whatsoever. The rights and remedies
provided by this Section 5.12 are cumulative and in addition to any other
rights and remedies which Parent or Buyer may have hereunder or at law or in
equity. 

   

5.13 _Financing Related Co-Operation_  

   

       | (a)  |   | Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
arrange the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Commitment Letter (or, at Parents option, on other terms, so long as such
terms do not impose any additional condition precedent to, and will not
materially delay the initial funding of the Debt Financing), which
shall include using its reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the
Commitment Letter, (ii) to enter into definitive agreements with respect
thereto on terms and conditions contained therein (the "Financing
Agreements"), (iii) to satisfy on a timely basis all conditions in the
Financing Agreements that are within its control and (iv) assuming all
conditions to the Commitment Letter have been satisfied or waived or, upon
funding, will be satisfied or waived, using its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Lender to consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | In the event any portion of the Debt Financing becomes
unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter
and/or the Financing Agreements, or in the event that Parent determines to
pursue alternative financing (as long as such alternative financing will not
impose any additional conditions precedent to, and will not materially delay,
the Closing), Parent shall use   ##### 

 

 

\- 61 - 

      |   |   | reasonable best efforts to arrange (i) to obtain any
such financing from alternative sources on terms no less favorable to Parent
in the aggregate (as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than
the terms provided for in Commitment Letter, in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Alternative
Financing") and (ii) to obtain, and, when obtained, promptly provide Vendor
with a copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for such
Alternative Financing in an amount that is sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter"). To the extent applicable, Parent shall use reasonable
best efforts to arrange the Alternative Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Alternative Financing Commitment Letter, which shall include
using its reasonable best efforts to (w) enter into definitive agreements
with respect thereto on terms and conditions contained therein (the
"Alternative Financing Agreements"), (x) to satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions in the Alternative Financing Agreements within its control and (y)
to consummate the Alternative Financing at or prior to the Closing.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | Parent shall give Vendor notice promptly upon becoming
aware of any (i) material breach by any party to, or termination of, the
Commitment Letter and/or the Financing Agreements and, if applicable, the
Alternative Financing Commitment Letter and/or the Alternative Financing
Agreements or (ii) refusal by the Lender or lender under an Alternative
Financing Commitment Letter to provide, or stated intent by such lender to
refuse to provide, or any other expression, concern or reservation by such
lender regarding the enforceability of the Commitment Letter or
Alternative Financing or its ability or willingness to provide, the full
amount of the financing contemplated therein. Parent shall keep Vendor
informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing and, if applicable, the Alternative
Financing. Parent shall not amend, modify, supplement, restate, substitute,
terminate or replace the Commitment Letter or any Alternative Financing
Commitment Letter in a manner that would materially impair, delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement without the prior written consent of Vendor (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).  
      
    | (d)  |   | Until the Closing Date, Vendor shall provide, and shall
cause the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees and Representatives to provide, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the other Affiliates of Vendor and their
respective officers, directors, employees and Representatives to provide, all
cooperation and assistance as may be reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with Parents efforts to obtain prior to Closing the Debt
Financing, if applicable, the Alternative Financing, or any refinancing of
the outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the "Transaction Financing"), including to: (i) participate in
customary meetings (including lender meetings), presentations, road shows,
due diligence and drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (ii)
assist with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations,
bank information memoranda,   ##### 

 

 

\- 62 - 

      |   |   | prospectuses and similar documents necessary in
connection with the Transaction Financing, including (A) to provide Parent no
later than January 11, 2010 (1) the Annual Financial Statements for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, (2) the Interim Financial Statements,
and (3) the Corresponding Interim Financial Statements, in each case with a
reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and, in the
case of each of such reconciliations and each of the Interim Financial
Statements and the Corresponding Interim Financial Statements, which
shall have all been reviewed by KPMG (collectively, the "Required Financial
Information"), or (B) if the Vendor shall have not provided the Required
Financial Information to Parent on or before January 11, 2010, to provide the
2009 Annual Financial Statements, which shall be prepared in accordance with
Canadian GAAP applied on a consistent basis in accordance with the past
practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries, together with a reconciliation
of the 2009 Annual Financial Statements to U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, which reconciliation shall have been reviewed by KPMG, no later
than February 26, 2010; (iii) subject to Section 5.5(a) of this Agreement,
furnish Parent and its financing sources financial and other pertinent
information regarding the Business as may be reasonably requested by Parent
to consummate the Transaction Financing; (iv) request from the appropriate
Person, and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, such consents,
legal opinions, and such other documents as reasonably requested by
Buyer, and in each case, as required to consummate the Transaction Financing;
(v) co-operate with prospective lenders involved in the Transaction Financing
to provide access to the properties, assets, and books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries; and (vi) execute and deliver at the Closing any
customary pledge and security documents, other definitive financing documents
or other customary documents, in each case as may be reasonably requested by
Buyer to the extent necessary to consummate the Transaction Financing;
_provided_ , that Vendor shall not be required to provide co-operation under
this Section 5.13 that: (A) unreasonably interferes with the ongoing
Business; (B) causes any representation, warranty or covenant in this
Agreement to be breached; (C) causes any closing condition set forth in
Article 4 to fail to be satisfied or otherwise causes the breach of this
Agreement; or (D) requires Vendor, the Company and its Subsidiaries or other
Affiliates of Vendor to pay any fees or incur any liabilities prior
to Closing for which they are not reimbursed when such fees or liabilities
are incurred or adequately indemnified. Parent shall (1) promptly after the
earlier of Closing and the date this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Section 7.1, reimburse Vendor for all reasonable, documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by Vendor or any of its Affiliates in
connection with their compliance with this Section 5.13 and (2) indemnify and
hold Vendor and its Affiliates harmless against any losses suffered by Vendor
or any of its Affiliates directly as a result of or in connection with its
co-operation under this Section 5.13.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

5.14 _Guarantees_  

  

The Parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
terminate and replace the Guarantees on or prior to the Closing, and release
and discharge Vendor and its Affiliates  ##### 

 

 

\- 63 -   

from all obligations thereunder. In the event that any such Guarantees are not
terminated on or prior to the Closing, the Parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to terminate such Guarantees as promptly as
practical following the Closing. Pending any termination of such Guarantees,
Parent shall indemnify Vendor and its Affiliates for all damages of Vendor and
its Affiliates arising after the Closing under such Guarantees in their
capacity as guarantors thereunder. 

   

5.15 _No Solicitation of the Company_  

  

Vendor agrees that between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of (a)
the Closing and (b) the termination of this Agreement, none of the Vendor,
the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives will (i) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or accept any
other proposals or offers from any Person (A) relating to any acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the shares of capital or other equity
securities of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any assets of such
parties (other than Inventory to be sold in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice) or (B) to enter into any
merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, reorganization
or other extraordinary business transaction involving or otherwise relating
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) participate in any
discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications regarding,
or furnish to any other Person any information with respect to, or enter into
any agreement, contract, arrangement or understanding with respect to, or
otherwise co-operate in any way with, assist or participate in, or facilitate
or encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to do any of
the foregoing. Vendor immediately shall cease and cause to be terminated all
existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other communications
with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing.
Vendor shall notify Parent and Buyer promptly in writing if any such proposal
or offer, or any inquiry or other contact with any Person with respect
thereto, is made and shall, in any such notice to Parent and Buyer, indicate
in reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact. Vendor agrees not to, and to cause the Company and
each of its Subsidiaries and its Affiliates (as it relates to the Company and
its Subsidiaries) not to, without the prior written consent of Parent, release
any Person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement to which Vendor and its Affiliates (as it relates to the Company
and its Subsidiaries), the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. 

   

5.16 _Release of Directors and Officers of German Subsidiaries_  

  

Prior to the Closing, the shareholders and, if applicable, advisory board of
the German Subsidiaries shall pass an unrestrained resolution of exoneration
( _Entlastungsbeschluss_ ), effective as of the Closing Date, in relation to
the managing directors ( _Gesch aftsfuhrer_) of the German Subsidiaries in
accordance with the provisions of the respective articles of association; 
_provided_ that such resolutions shall not release or otherwise exonerate any
of the managing directors of the German Subsidiaries for any actions or
conduct that such managing director would not otherwise be entitled to
indemnification for under the articles of association of the applicable
German Subsidiary or under applicable Law.  ##### 

 

 

\- 64 -    

5.17 _Employee Bonus Amounts_  

  

Vendor shall cause the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company to pay or cause
to be paid the Employee Bonus Amounts as follows: (i) in the case of annual
performance bonuses for 2009, the earlier of (A) in the ordinary course of
business in a manner consistent with the Companys past practice and (B) the
Closing Date but prior to the Closing; and (ii) in the case of special
bonuses or other amounts payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, on the Closing Date but prior to the

6.1 _Indemnification by Vendor_  

  

If the Closing occurs, Vendor covenants and agrees with Parent and Buyer to
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and Buyer, their Affiliates (including the
Company and its Subsidiaries) and their respective shareholders, partners,
directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and
assignors (the "Buyer Indemnified Parties") from and against any Claim, cause
of action, damage, loss, Taxes, cost, liability, expense, fines, awards,
judgments and penalties (including reasonable professionals fees and

Buyer Indemnified Parties or which they may suffer or incur in respect of, as
a result of, relating to or arising out of or with respect to, without
duplication: 

   

       | (a)  |   | any non-performance or breach of any covenant or
agreement on the part of Vendor or the Company contained in this Agreement;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty of Vendor contained in this Agreement (it being understood that such
representations and warranties shall be interpreted without giving effect to
any limitations or qualifications as to "materiality" (including the word
"material") or "Material Adverse Change" set forth therein);  
      
    | (c)  |   | any Indemnified Taxes (provided that, for greater
certainty, no double recovery shall be permitted in respect of Taxes that
constitute both Damages and Indemnified Taxes); or  
      
    | (d)  |   | any amounts payable by the Company or its Subsidiaries
to their respective employees following the Closing Date in respect of (i)
annual performance bonuses for 2009 or (ii) any special bonuses or other
amounts payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  
   

  

6.2 _Indemnification by Parent and Buyer_  

  

If the Closing occurs, Parent and Buyer, jointly and severally, covenant and
agree with Vendor and its Affiliates and its shareholders, directors,
officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors and assignors (the
"Vendor Indemnified Parties") to indemnify and hold harmless each of Vendor
Indemnified Parties, from and against any Damages which may be made or  ##### 

 

 

\- 65 -   

brought against any of the Vendor Indemnified Parties or which they may suffer
or incur in respect of, as a result of, or arising out of or with respect to,
without duplication: 

   

       | (a)  |   | any non-performance or breach of any covenant or
agreement on the part of Parent or Buyer under this Agreement; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | any inaccuracy in or breach of any of Parents or
Buyers representations or warranties contained in this Agreement (it being
understood that such representations and warranties shall be interpreted
without giving effect to any limitations or qualifications as to
"materiality" (including the word "material") set forth therein).  
   

  

6.3 _Procedure for Indemnification_  

   

       | (a)  |   | Claims Other Than Third Party Claims  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |   |   | In order for a Vendor Indemnified Party, on the one hand,
or a Buyer Indemnified Party, on the other hand, as the case may be (each, an
"Indemnified Party") to be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Article 6 for a Claim which has not arisen in respect of a Third Party Claim
(as defined in Section 6.3(b) below), the Indemnified Party shall notify the
other Party or Parties from which such indemnification is sought (the
"Indemnifying Party") in writing promptly after the occurrence of the event
giving rise to such Indemnified Partys claim for indemnification, _provided_
that failure to give such notification shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder unless (and only to the extent that) the Indemnifying
Party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days to make such investigation of the claim
as the Indemnifying Party considers desirable. For the purpose of
such investigation, the Indemnified Party shall make available to the
Indemnifying Party the information relied upon by the Indemnified Party to
substantiate the claim. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
agree at or prior to the expiration of such 30-day period (or any mutually
agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of the claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall immediately pay or cause to be paid such amount to
the Indemnified Party by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account designated in writing by the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party do not agree within such period
(or any mutually agreed upon extension thereof), such dispute shall, subject
to the terms of this Agreement, be resolved by litigation in an appropriate
court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 8.10.  
      
    | (b)  |   | Third Party Claims  
      
    |   |   | The Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party
in writing as soon as is reasonably practicable after being informed that
facts exist which may result in a claim originating from a Person other than
the Indemnified Party (a "Third Party Claim") and in respect of which a right
of indemnification given pursuant to Section 6.1 or 6.2 may apply which
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the  ##### 

 

 

\- 66 -  

     |   |   | facts known to the Indemnified Party and the events
giving rise to such Third Party Claim; provided that failure to provide such
notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any of its obligations
under this Agreement unless (and only to the extent that) the Indemnifying
Party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to elect, by written notice delivered
to the Indemnified Party within ten days of receipt by the Indemnifying Party
of the notice from the Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party Claim,
at the sole expense of the Indemnifying Party, to participate in or assume
control of the negotiation, settlement or defence of the Third Party
Claim with counsel of its choice (which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party); _provided_ that:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | such will be done at all times in a diligent and
bona fide manner;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing
its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party in accordance with the
terms contained in this Agreement in respect of that Third Party Claim; and  
      
    | (iii)  |   | notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.3(b) to
the contrary, if the claim for indemnification with respect to a Third
Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to jointly control the defence
thereof with the Indemnifying Party (and to employ counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party, at its own expense) for so long as such
criminal Claim has not been finally resolved.  
   

 

If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume such control, (A) the Indemnified
Party shall reasonably co-operate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel
in the defence or prosecution thereof and (B) the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate in the negotiation, settlement or defence of
such Third Party Claim at its own expense; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defence
with separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying Party if (1) so
requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate with separate counsel, (2)
the named parties to the Third Party Claim include the Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party and, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Party there exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of
interest between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would
make such separate representation advisable, or (3) in the reasonable opinion
of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party is not conducting the
defence of such Third Party Claim diligently and in a bona fide manner.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party reasonably necessary to defend
such Third Party Claim incurred by the Indemnified Party for any period
during which the Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defence thereof, and
such fees and expenses shall constitute Damages for purposes of this
Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume such control,
the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume such control. In the
event that the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly, conducting the
defence against any such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Section
6.3(b), the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably co-operate with the
Indemnified Party and its counsel in the defence or prosecution thereof
and, subject to Section 6.3(a) the  ##### 

 

 

\- 67 -   

Indemnifying Party shall be bound by the results obtained by the Indemnified
Party with respect to such Third Party Claim. 

   

6.4 _Additional Rules and Procedures_  

  

The obligation of the Parties to indemnify each other pursuant to this Article
6 shall also be subject to the following: 

   

       | (a)  |   | an Indemnified Party shall only be entitled to
make a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 6.1(b) or 6.2(b), as the
case be, if written notice containing reasonable particulars of such claim is
delivered to the Indemnifying Party within the applicable time period
provided for in Sections 3.3(a) or 3.4(a), as the case may be;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise
any Third Party Claim except with the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld). A
failure by the Indemnifying Party to respond in writing to a written request
by the Indemnified Party for consent for a period of ten days or more, shall
be deemed a consent by the Indemnifying Party to such request;  
      
    | (c)  |   | the Parties acknowledge that the provisions of this
Agreement relating to the period of time during which representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements, including the obligation to indemnify,
remain in effect are a fundamental term of this Agreement and the Parties
waive the benefit of any applicable Law which may affect the enforceability
of such provisions;  
      
    | (d)  |   | an Indemnifying Party will have no liability to
indemnify under Section 6.1(b) or 6.2(b), as the case may be, in respect of
Damages resulting from a single claim or set of related claims, where the
Damages resulting from each such claim or set of related claims is less than
$40,000, and an Indemnifying Party will have no liability to indemnify for
any claim for indemnification under Section 6.1(b) or 6.2(b), as the case may
be, until the aggregate of all Damages exceeds $1,500,000, in which case
the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification only for the
amount of such Damages that exceed such amount; _provided_ that the
limitations set forth in this Section 6.4(d) shall not apply to Damages based
on (i) claims for indemnification of Indemnified Taxes, (ii) a breach or
inaccuracy of any of the Core Representations or (iii) the representations
and warranties in Sections 3.2(a), 3.2(c) and 3.2(f), for which, in each
case, there shall be no minimum threshold before recovery;  
      
    | (e)  |   | the maximum aggregate liability of an Indemnifying

to take into account any insurance proceeds received (less any increase in
premiums and costs associated with receipt of such insurance proceeds) and

Affiliates attributable or relating to such claims provided that (i) all
other Tax items of the Indemnified Party that reduce liabilities for Taxes
shall be taken into account prior to taking into account any Tax items that
are attributed directly to the Damages, (ii) the amount of any Tax benefit
shall be reduced by any Tax costs actually realized by the Indemnified Party
that are attributed directly to an indemnification payment received by the
Indemnified Party in respect of Damages, and (iii) in the event of a
subsequent disallowance by an Authority of a Tax benefit that has been paid
to an Indemnifying Party or that otherwise reduced Damages, the Indemnifying
Party shall promptly pay the Indemnified Party the amount of such Tax benefit
together with any applicable interest, penalties or other additions. If
after an indemnification payment is made under this Agreement, the Party to
which such payment is made receives insurance proceeds with respect to the
Damages for which the indemnification payment was made, such amount shall be
promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party (less any increase in premiums
and costs associated with receipt of such insurance proceeds);

in Section 5.9(a) or Section 5.12, the provisions of this Article 6 shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for monetary Damages arising out of or
resulting from breach of any representations, warranties or agreements made
in this Agreement, absent intentional misrepresentation or fraud by the Party
against which a remedy is sought;  
      
    | (h)  |   | any payment under this Article 6 shall constitute an
adjustment to the Purchase Price;  
      
    | (i)  |   | any payment made under this Article 6 shall be paid
free and clear of any Tax deduction or withholding and, if any deduction or
withholding is required by applicable Tax Law, the Indemnifying Party shall
increase the amount of the payment by such additional amount as is necessary
to ensure that the net amount received by the Indemnified Party is equal to
the amount which the Indemnified Party would have received had the payment in
question not been subject to any deductions or withholding; and  
      
    | (j)  |   | no double recovery shall be permitted in respect of any
matter giving rise to a Claim under more than one provision of Sections 6.1
or 6.2.

7.1 _Termination_  

  

This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may
be abandoned, at any time prior to the Closing: 

   

       | (a)  |   | by mutual consent of Vendor, on the one hand, and
Parent and Buyer, on the other hand;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | by either Vendor or Parent if the Closing shall not
have occurred by March 15, 2010 (the "End Date"), _provided_ that if the
Company has not delivered to Parent the Required Financial Information on or
before January 11, 2010, the End Date shall be April 30, 2010, _provided_
_further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(b) shall not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfill any
obligation under this Agreement (or, in the case of Parent, any failure by
Buyer to fulfill any of its obligations under this Agreement) shall have been
the cause of, or shall have resulted in the failure of, the Closing to occur
on or before such date;  
      
    | (c)  |   | by either Vendor, on the one hand, or Parent and Buyer,
on the other hand, if there has been a breach of any covenant or a breach of
any representation or warranty of Parent and Buyer or Vendor, respectively,
in each case which breach would cause the failure of any condition precedent
set forth in Article 4 to be satisfied, provided that, with respect to any
such breach of a covenant or representation or warranty that is curable, such
breach has not been cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching
Party of written notice of such breach;  
      
    | (d)  |   | by any Party, if there shall be any applicable Law that
makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or
otherwise prohibited or if any order of any Authority restraining, enjoining
or otherwise prohibiting such transactions is entered and such order shall
become final and non-appealable.  
   

  

7.2 _Effect of Termination_  

  

A Party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1, shall
provide written notice thereof to the other Party or Parties specifying the
provision of Section 7.1 pursuant to which such termination is made, and this
Agreement shall be terminated immediately upon delivery of such notice and,
except as otherwise provided herein or in the immediately following sentence,
this Agreement shall forthwith become void and there shall be no liability or
other obligation hereunder on the part of Parent or Buyer on the one hand or
Vendor on the other hand, except that the provisions of Section 5.5(a)
(Confidentiality), Section 5.11 (German Real Estate Transfer Tax), the last
sentence of Section 5.13 (Financing Related Co-operation), Section 7.1
(Termination), this Section 7.2 and Article 8 (General) shall survive any
termination of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 7.2 shall relieve any Party of liability for any damages arising out
of fraud or a knowing breach of any provision of this Agreement. 

       #####

ARTICLE 8 
 GENERAL 

   

8.1 _Public Notices_  

  

All public notices to third parties and all other publicity concerning this
Agreement and the matters contemplated hereby shall be jointly planned and
coordinated by the Parties and no Party shall act unilaterally in this regard
without the prior written approval of the other Parties (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except to the extent that the Party
making such notice is required to do so by applicable Law, court process or
by the applicable regulations or policies of any regulatory agency of
competent jurisdiction or any stock exchange in circumstances where prior
consultation with the other Parties is not practicable, provided that in such
case concurrent notice to the other Parties is provided. 

   

8.2 _Expenses_  

  

Each Party to this Agreement shall pay its respective legal, accounting and
other professional advisory fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the negotiation, preparation or execution of this Agreement and all
documents and instruments executed or delivered pursuant to this Agreement,
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether or not the
Closing shall have occurred, provided that (i) any filing fees required in
connection with any Regulatory Approvals shall be borne equally by the
Vendor, on the one hand, and Parent and Buyer, on the other hand and (ii)
except as set forth in Section 5.11, Buyer shall pay any transfer, stamp,
documentary and similar Taxes incurred in connection with the sale of the
Purchased Shares by Vendor to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Vendor will
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries not to incur any out-of-pocket
expenses in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby that are not otherwise paid by Vendor prior to Closing. 

   

8.3 _Further Assurances_  

  

The Parties shall do all such things and provide all such reasonable
assurances as may be reasonably required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party shall provide such further
documents or instruments required by any other Party as may be reasonably
necessary or desirable to effect the purpose of this Agreement and carry out
its provisions, whether before or after Closing. In particular, without
limitation, Vendor and Buyer shall forthwith after the Closing Date cooperate
in order to duly notify the German Federal Cartel Authority (
_Bundeskartellamt_ ) of the occurrence of the Closing in accordance with the
provisions of applicable Laws. 

   

8.4 _Assignment and Enurement_  

  

Neither this Agreement nor any benefits or duties accruing under this
Agreement shall be assignable by any Party without the prior written consent
of each of the other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed and any such assignment or attempted assignment
without such consent shall be void; _provided_ , _however_ , that each of
Parent and Buyer may assign this Agreement or any of its rights and
obligations hereunder in whole or in part to one or more of its Affiliates or
designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations thereunder
without the consent of Vendor and in any or all of which cases Parent shall
remain  ##### 

 

 

\- 71 -   

responsible for all of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the foregoing,
this Agreement shall enure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties
and their respective successors (including any successor by reason of
amalgamation of any Party) and permitted assigns. 

   

8.5 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_  

  

This Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Vendor Limited Guarantee and any
agreement or document delivered pursuant to this Agreement and such
agreements, constitutes the entire agreement among the Parties with respect
to the matters herein and therein and supersedes all prior
agreements, understandings, undertakings, negotiations and discussions
relating to the subject matter hereof. There are no other covenants,
agreements, representations, warranties, conditions, whether direct or
collateral, express or implied, that form part of or affect this Agreement
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the
Vendor Limited Guarantee. This Agreement shall not be amended, added to or
qualified except by (a) written agreement signed by, or on behalf of, all of
the Parties or (b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 8.6. 

   

8.6 _Waiver_  

  

Each Party may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other Parties contained herein or
in any document delivered by the other Parties pursuant hereto, or (c) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the other Parties or conditions to such Parties obligations
contained herein. Except as otherwise expressly set out herein, no such
waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be binding unless it is
in writing and signed by the Party or Parties to be bound thereby. No
indulgence or forbearance by a Party to assert any of its rights hereunder
shall constitute a waiver of such Partys right to insist on performance in
full and in a timely manner of all covenants in this Agreement. Waiver of any
provision shall not be deemed to waive the same provision thereafter, or any
other provision of this Agreement, at any other time. 

   

8.7 _Notices_  

  

All notices, requests, Claims, demands or other communications required or
permitted to be given by one Party to another under this Agreement shall be

restricted, invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any applicable Law: (a) the
remainder of this Agreement or the application of such provision or portion
thereof to any other Person or circumstance shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the

adverse to any Party; and (b) the Parties will negotiate in good faith to
amend this Agreement to implement the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions

accordance herewith, along with any amendments hereto or thereto, to the
extent executed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine, scanned email
or internet transmission copy or other means of electronic transmission, shall
be treated in all manner and respects and for all purposes as an original
signature, agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same
binding legal effect as if it were the original executed version thereof
delivered in person. 

   

8.10 _Governing Law and Jurisdiction_

the courts of the Province of Ontario. Consistent with the preceding sentence,

execution, that such Claim is improper, or that this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby may not be enforced in or by the above-
named court.

notification), then the Party whose consent or approval is required shall be
conclusively deemed to have withheld its approval or consent. 

   

8.12 _Undisputed Amount_  

  

Subject to the express provisions of this Agreement, where there is any
dispute as to the amount of money owing by any Party to any other Party
hereunder, the portion of the amount owing that is not in dispute or
otherwise contested or challenged, if any, shall be paid within the time
required herein of if the required time has elapsed, shall be paid

8.13 _Specific Performance_  

  

Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that the other Parties would be
damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are
breached or violated. Accordingly, each of the Parties agrees that, without
posting bond or other undertaking, the other Parties will be entitled to seek
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or violations of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and
the terms and provisions hereof in any Claim (whether at law or in equity,
whether civil or criminal), cause of action (whether in contract or tort
or otherwise), hearing, charge, complaint, demand or notice to, from, by or
before any Authority having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter in
addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or in
