to be executed and delivered by Seller at or prior to the Closing pursuant to
_Section 7.2_ or as are otherwise reasonably required in connection with this
Agreement; and

 



 

(b) Buyer shall:

 



 

(i) pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account(s) designated by Seller to Buyer at least two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, in an amount equal to the

documents and instruments as are required to be executed and delivered by

(a) _Closing Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price to be paid by Buyer
at the Closing for the Shares shall be an amount in cash equal to the sum of:
( _i_ ) the Base Purchase Price, _plus_ ( _ii_ ) the Closing Date Cash,
_minus_ ( _iii_ ) the Closing Date Indebtedness, _plus_ ( _iv_ ) the Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount (which may be a positive or negative
number), _minus_ ( _v_ ) the Covered Transaction Costs, _minus_ ( _vi_ ) the
Client Consent Adjustment Amount, if any (the sum of the amounts described in
the immediately preceding _clauses (i)_ through ( _vi_ ), without duplication
in any such clause of any amount taken into account in any other such clause,
the " _Closing Purchase Price_ "), _plus_ the Consent True-Up Payment Amount,
if any.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) _Estimated Amounts_. No later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer a written statement certified on
behalf of Seller by an executive officer of Seller (the " _Seller Statement_
") setting forth an estimate of the Closing Purchase Price (the " _Estimated
Closing Purchase Price_ "), which shall be based upon good-faith estimates of
the Closing Date Cash, the Closing Date Indebtedness, the Net Working Capital
Adjustment Amount, the Covered Transaction Costs and the Client Consent
Adjustment Amount, if any, delivered with reasonable supporting detail with
respect to the calculation of such amounts, which Seller Statement shall be
accompanied by such written evidence of the Advisory Client consents and the
Closing Revenue Run-Rates for all of the Advisory Clients with respect to
which consent has been obtained as of the Calculation Time, as is reasonably
necessary to support the calculation of the Client Consent Adjustment Amount.
Seller will take into consideration, in good faith, any proposed revisions to
the Seller Statement and Estimated Closing Purchase Price as are presented in
good faith by Buyer prior to the Closing Date and, to the extent Seller and
Buyer mutually agree to any such revisions, Seller shall update the Seller
Statement and Estimated Closing Purchase Price to reflect any such mutually
agreed-upon revisions (which updated versions shall be considered the Seller
Statement and the Estimated Closing Purchase Price for all purposes
hereunder). If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach mutual agreement with
respect to any dispute related to the Seller Statement or Estimated Closing
Purchase Price, such dispute shall not under any circumstance delay the
Closing, the Seller Statement and Estimated Closing Purchase Price provided by
Seller to Buyer shall be binding for purposes of this _Section 2.4(b)_, and
the amounts payable at Closing pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ shall be
calculated as set forth in the Seller Statement provided by Seller to Buyer
(and, if applicable, as modified to reflect any revisions mutually agreed upon
by Seller and Buyer). For the avoidance of doubt, no proposed revisions
provided by Buyer or any such mutually-agreed upon revisions to the Seller
Statement or Estimated Closing Purchase Price in accordance with this _Section
2.4(b)_, or any consummation of the Closing regardless of any dispute with
respect to the Seller Statement or the Estimated Closing Purchase Price as
provided in this _Section 2.4(b)_, shall constitute acceptance by Buyer of
the Seller Statement for purposes of any post-Closing adjustment.

 



 

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 



 

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than seventy-five (75) days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers calculation of ( _A_ ) the
Closing Date Cash, ( _B_ ) the Closing Date Indebtedness, ( _C_ ) the Net
Working Capital Adjustment Amount, ( _D_ ) the Covered Transaction Costs, (
_E_ ) the Client Consent Adjustment Amount, if any, and ( _F_ ) the Closing
Purchase Price. Buyers calculations of such amounts set forth in the Closing
Statement (collectively, the " _Buyer Proposed Calculations_ ") shall be
delivered with reasonable supporting detail with respect to the calculation of
such amounts. If Buyer fails to deliver the Closing Statement within such
seventy-five (75) day period, or if Buyer accepts in writing the Estimated
Closing Purchase Price set forth in the Seller Statement, then Buyer and
Seller shall be deemed to have agreed that the Closing Purchase Price is equal
to the Estimated Closing Purchase Price and such amounts shall be finally
determined and binding on the Parties for all purposes hereunder.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) Within sixty (60) days of receipt of the Closing Statement, Seller may
provide written notice to Buyer disputing all or a part of the Buyer Proposed
Calculations, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the proposed
amount for each item in dispute and the basis for Sellers disagreement (such
notice, a " _Dispute Notice_ "). If Seller fails to deliver a Dispute Notice
to Buyer within such sixty (60) day period, or if Seller accepts in writing
the Buyer Proposed Calculations, then Buyer and Seller shall be deemed to have
agreed that the Buyer Proposed Calculations set forth in the applicable
Closing Statement shall be finally determined and binding on the Parties for
all purposes hereunder. If a Dispute Notice is provided to Buyer, then Buyer
and Seller shall negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve the disputed items during a thirty (30) day period
commencing on the date of Buyers receipt of the Dispute Notice.

 



 

(iii) If Seller and Buyer do not agree in writing upon a final resolution with
respect to any disputed items within such thirty (30) day period,
notwithstanding good faith negotiation between Buyer and Seller, then the
remaining items in dispute shall be submitted immediately to Deloitte, or, if
such firm declines to be retained to resolve such disputed items, another
nationally recognized, independent accounting firm acceptable to Buyer and
Seller (in either case, the " _Accounting Firm_ ") within fifteen (15) days
thereafter. The Parties shall instruct the Accounting Firm to render a
determination of the applicable disputed items in accordance with the terms
and provisions of this Agreement within thirty (30) days after referral of the
matter to such Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and
must set forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The terms of
appointment and engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as agreed upon
between Seller and Buyer, and any associated engagement fees shall be
initially borne fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by
Buyer; _provided_ that all such fees shall ultimately be borne by Seller and
Buyer in inverse proportion to the relative difference between the positions
taken by the Parties compared to the determination of the Accounting Firm,
which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting
Firm at the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the
merits of the disputed items. Except as provided in the preceding sentence,
all other costs and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with
resolving any dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne by
the Party incurring such cost and expense. In resolving the disputed items,
the Accounting Firm shall ( _A_ ) be bound by the provisions of this _Section
2.4_, ( _B_ ) not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value
claimed for such item or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by
either Buyer or Seller, ( _C_ ) rely solely on the written submissions of the
Parties and shall not conduct an independent investigation and ( _D_ ) limit
its decision to only such items as are in dispute and to only those
adjustments as are necessary for the Buyer Proposed Calculations to comply
with the provisions of this Agreement. Such determination of the Accounting
Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon

 



      

 

 



 

the Parties for all purposes hereunder upon which a judgment may be rendered
by a court having proper jurisdiction over the Party against which such
determination is sought to be enforced.

 



 

(iv) The Parties shall, and shall cause their respective independent
accountants and their respective Affiliates to, reasonably cooperate and
assist in the calculation of the Closing Purchase Price and the components
thereof upon the reasonable request of the other Party, and in the conduct of
the review by the Accounting Firm of any proposed calculations of the Closing
Purchase Price or the components thereof, including making available (to the
extent necessary to resolve the items in dispute and subject to customary
confidentiality and indemnity agreements) books, records, work papers and
relevant personnel.

 



 

(v) Within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Closing
Purchase Price (and the components thereof) is finally determined pursuant to
this _Section 2.4(c)_:

 



 

(A) if the Closing Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(c)_, is greater than the Estimated Closing Purchase Price, Buyer
shall pay to Seller, an aggregate cash amount equal to such excess; or

 



 

(B) if the Estimated Closing Purchase Price is greater than the Closing
Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 2.4(c)_,
Seller shall pay to Buyer an aggregate cash amount equal to such excess.

 



 

(vi) For all Tax purposes, any payment made by the parties pursuant to
_Section 2.4(c)(v)_ shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the
Closing Purchase Price.

 



 

(d) _Accounting Procedures_. The Estimated Closing Purchase Price, the Buyer
Proposed Calculations, the Closing Purchase Price, the Seller Statement, the
Closing Statement and the calculations contained therein (other than the
calculation of the Client Consent Adjustment Amount) shall be determined based
on GAAP, to the extent consistent with GAAP, the principles, methodologies,
policies, notes and procedures applied in the preparation of the unaudited
combined balance sheets of the Acquired Companies as of December 31, 2017 as
set forth on _Exhibit A_ and the principles set forth on _Section 2.4(d)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes an
illustrative calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, such principles, methodologies, policies,
notes, procedures and determinations shall ( _A_ ) not include any purchase
accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the
Transactions, ( _B_ ) be based on facts and circumstances as they exist as at
the Calculation Time and shall exclude the effect of any act, decision or
event occurring after such time (except with respect to Covered Transaction
Costs, which shall be based on facts and circumstances as they exist as of the
Closing and shall exclude the effect of any act, decision or event occurring
after the Closing), ( _C_ ) follow the defined terms contained in this

 



     

 

 



 

Agreement and ( _D_ ) calculate any reserves, accruals or other non-cash
expense items, prepaid expenses and other current assets on a daily accrual
(as opposed to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Calculation Time (or in
the case of Covered Transaction Costs, the Closing) that occurs on any date
other than the last day of a calendar month.

 



 

Section 2.5 _Post-Closing Consent True-Up_. If the Client Consent Adjustment
Amount (as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4_, the " _Initial
Client Consent Adjustment Amount_ ") is greater than zero, then:

 



 

(a) upon the later of ( _i_ ) the expiration of the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days
after the Closing Date (such period the " _True-Up Period_ ") and ( _ii_ ) the
final determination of the Closing Purchase Price pursuant to _Section
2.4(c)_, Buyer shall recalculate the Client Consent Adjustment Amount as of
the Closing and provide such calculation and reasonable supporting
documentation for such calculation to Seller; _provided_ that the True-Up
Revenue Run-Rate shall be used in such calculation instead of the Closing
Revenue Run-Rate. Any disputes that arise with respect to such calculation
shall be resolved according to the dispute procedures set forth in _Section
2.4(c)(ii)_, _Section 2.4(c)(iii)_ and _Section 2.4(c)(iv)_ _ mutatis
mutandis_.

 



 

(b) If the Client Consent Adjustment Amount as recalculated and finally
determined pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ (such amount, the " _True-Up Client
Consent Adjustment Amount_ ") is less than the Initial Client Consent
Adjustment Amount, then Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller in cash the
difference between the Initial Client Consent Adjustment Amount and the True-
Up Client Consent Adjustment Amount (such aggregate amount, the " _Consent
True-Up Payment Amount_ ").

 



 

(c) During the True-Up Period, Buyer shall within ten (10) Business Days after
the end of each calendar month provide Seller with a written update regarding
consents or other correspondence received by Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Companies) from any Advisory Clients that bear on the
calculations to be performed pursuant to this _Section 2.5_, together with
reasonable supporting documentation.

 



 

Section 2.6 _Calculation and Payment of Earn Out Payments_.

 



 

(a) _Earn Out Payments_. Following the Closing, Buyer shall pay, or cause to
be paid, to Seller as additional consideration for the purchase of the Shares,
the Earn Out Payment, if any, in respect of each Earn Out Year upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this _Section 2.6_.

 



 

(b) _Buyer Proposed Earn Out Calculation_. Buyer shall prepare and deliver to
Seller no later than sixty (60) days after the end of each Earn Out Year, a
written statement (the " _Buyer Earn Out Statement_ "), which shall set forth
Buyers calculation of the Earn Out Payment for such Earn Out Year (the "
_Buyer Calculated Earn Out Payment_ ") and be accompanied by reasonably
detailed supporting documentation and calculations with respect to the
calculation of such amount.

 



 

(c) _Dispute Resolution_. Within forty-five (45) days after Sellers receipt
of the Buyer Earn Out Statement, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a written
statement either accepting the Buyer Earn Out Statement and the Buyer
Calculated Earn Out Payment or disputing all or a part thereof

 



     

 

 



 

(an " _Earn Out Payment Objections Statement_ "). If Seller does not deliver
to Buyer an Earn Out Payment Objections Statement within such forty-five (45)
day period (other than as a result of a breach by Buyer of _Section 2.6(e)_,
in which case such forty-five (45) day period shall be extended until Seller
is provided a reasonable period of time to exercise (and avail itself of) its
rights in connection with _Section 2.6(e)_), or if Seller accepts in writing
the Buyer Earn Out Statement and the Buyer Calculated Earn Out Payment, then
Buyer and Seller shall be deemed to have agreed that the Buyer Calculated Earn
Out Payment set forth in the applicable Buyer Earn Out Statement and such
amounts shall be finally determined and binding on the Parties for all
purposes hereunder. If Seller delivers an Earn Out Payment Objections
Statement within such forty-five (45) day period (or such longer period as
permitted under this _Section 2.6(c)_), then Seller and Buyer shall negotiate
in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the disputed
items set forth in the Earn Out Payment Objections Statement during a thirty
(30) day period (or such longer period that may be mutually agreed in writing
between Buyer and Seller) (such period, the " _Earn Out Resolution Period_ ")
following Buyers receipt of such Earn Out Payment Objections Statement. If
Seller and Buyer do not agree in writing upon a final resolution with respect
to any disputed items set forth in the applicable Earn Out Payment Objections
Statement within the Earn Out Resolution Period, notwithstanding good faith
negotiation between Buyer and Seller, then the remaining items in dispute (and
only such remaining items in dispute) (the " _Earn Out Disputed Items_ ")
shall be submitted immediately to the Accounting Firm within fifteen (15) days
thereafter and the terms and conditions of _Section 2.4(c)(iii)_ and _Section
2.4(c)(iv)_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ to the resolution of such remaining
items in dispute.

 



 

(d) _Payment of Earn Out Payment_. Each Earn Out Payment for an applicable
Earn Out Year that is required to be paid to Seller pursuant to this _Section
2.6_ shall be paid by or on behalf of Buyer to Seller (or its designee), in
the manner set forth in _Section 2.6(f)_ (subject to Buyers right of offset
if and to the extent applicable under _Section 10.4(j)_) no later than five
(5) Business Days ( _i_ ) after the date on which Seller accepts in writing,
or is deemed to have agreed to, the Buyer Earn Out Statement and the Buyer
Calculated Earn Out Payment in accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_ or ( _ii_ )
if Seller delivers an Earn Out Payment Objections Statement, ( _A_ ) after the
Earn Out Resolution Period with respect to the portion of the Earn Out Payment
for such Earn Out Year that is not the subject of dispute at the end of such
Earn Out Resolution Period ( _e.g._ , if the total Earn Out Payment for such
Earn Out Year would be $30,000,000 if all Earn Out Disputed Items were
resolved in favor of Seller and $25,000,000 if all Earn Out Disputed Items
were resolved in favor of Buyer, the portion of the Earn Out Payment for such
Earn Out Year that is not the subject of dispute is $25,000,000), and ( _B_ )
with respect to the portion (if any) of the Earn Out Payment that is subject
to dispute, after the resolution of the relevant Earn Out Disputed Items in
accordance with _Section 2.6(c)_.

 



 

(e) _Seller Access_. From and after the date on which Seller receives a Buyer
Earn Out Statement for a particular Earn Out Year until the date on which the
Earn Out Payment for such Earn Out Year is finally determined or agreed
pursuant to this _Section 2.6_, upon reasonable advance notice and in a
manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations
of Buyer and its Affiliates, Buyer shall (and shall cause each of its
applicable Affiliates to) provide to Seller and Sellers Affiliates and
advisors (and each of their respective authorized representatives) during
normal business hours access to the books and records of Buyer and its
Affiliates (and Seller and Sellers Affiliates and advisors (and each of their
respective authorized representatives) shall be permitted to make copies of
such books and records) and to Buyers and

 



     

 

 



 

its applicable Affiliates respective personnel and accountants for the
purposes of reviewing the Buyer Earn Out Statement and Buyer Calculated Earn
Out Payment.

 



 

(f) _Method of Payment; Tax Matters_. All Earn Out Payments shall be made in
cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account(s)
designated by Seller in writing to Buyer on or prior to the date on which such
payment is made. Any Earn Out Payment made to Seller pursuant to this
Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, including Section 483
or 1274 of the Code.

 



 

(g) _Earn Out Cap_. In no event shall the payments made under this _Section
2.6_ exceed ( _i_ ) with respect to the Earn Out Payment for any individual

requisite organizational power and authority to carry on its business
substantially in the manner as it is now being conducted and to own, lease and
operate all of its properties and assets. Buyer is duly licensed or qualified
to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business being
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned, leased or operated by it makes such qualification or licensing
necessary except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not
reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Buyer to

 



     

 

 



 

timely complete the Transactions or timely perform its obligations hereunder
(a " _Buyer Material Adverse Effect_ ").

 



 

Section 5.2 _Authority; No Violation_.

 



 

(a) Buyer has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to
which it is or will be a party and to consummate the Transactions. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
Buyer is or will be a party, the performance by Buyer of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the Transactions by Buyer
have been duly authorized by all requisite action of Buyer and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Buyer are necessary to authorize the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which
Buyer is or will be a party, the performance by Buyer of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and the consummation of the Transactions by Buyer.
This Agreement has been (and the execution and delivery of each of the
Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer will be a party will be) duly executed and
delivered by Buyer and constitutes (and each such Ancillary Agreement when so
executed and delivered by Buyer will constitute) a valid, legal and binding
agreement of Buyer (assuming that this Agreement has been, and the Ancillary
Agreements to which Buyer is a party will be, duly and validly authorized,
executed and delivered by the other Persons party thereto), enforceable
against Buyer in accordance with their terms, except ( _i_ ) to the extent
that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally and ( _ii_ ) that the availability
of equitable remedies, including specific performance, is subject to the
discretion of the court before which any proceeding thereof may be brought.

 



 

(b) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in _Section 3.2(b)_, no notices to, filings with or authorizations,
consents or approvals of any Governmental Authority are necessary for the
execution, delivery or performance by Buyer of this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer is a party or the consummation by Buyer of
the Transactions, except for ( _i_ ) compliance with and filings under the HSR
Act and any other applicable Competition Laws and ( _ii_ ) those the failure
of which to obtain or make would not reasonably be expected to have a Buyer
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.3 _Non-Contravention_. The execution and delivery by Buyer of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which Buyer is or will be a party
and the performance of its obligations hereunder and thereunder (including the
consummation of the Transactions) do not ( _a_ ) conflict with or violate any
provision of the Organizational Documents of Buyer, ( _b_ ) assuming all
consents, approvals and authorizations contemplated by _Section 3.2(b)_ and
_Section 5.2(b)_ have been obtained and all filings described therein have
been made, conflict with or violate in any material respect any Applicable Law
with respect to Buyer, ( _c_ ) require any consent of or other action by any
Person under, or result in a violation or breach of, or constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default or give rise to any
right of termination, cancellation or acceleration under, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any material Contract to which Buyer is a party or
( _d_ ) except as contemplated by this Agreement, result in the creation or
imposition of any Encumbrance on any asset of Buyer (other than Permitted
Encumbrances), except, in the

 



     

 

 



 

case of _clauses (b)_ , _(c)_ and _(d)_ , as would not reasonably be expected
to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 5.4 _Availability of Funds_. Attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ is a true
and complete fully-executed copy of the debt commitment letter, dated as of
the date hereof (as amended, restated, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified or waived in accordance with _Section 6.16_, and including all
exhibits, annexes, schedules and term sheets attached thereto, the "
_Commitment Letter_ "), among Barclays Bank PLC, Royal Bank of Canada and
Buyer, pursuant to which the Financing Sources have committed to provide or
cause to be provided debt financing in the amounts set forth therein to Buyer
in connection with the Transactions (the " _Financing_ "), and each fully-
executed fee letter related thereto (collectively, the " _Fee Letter_ "),
which Fee Letter may be redacted to omit fee amounts and economic terms, but
in any event, may not be redacted with respect to any condition precedent or
contingency to the funding of the Financing. As of the date hereof, the
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter constitute all of the agreements and
Contracts entered into between each of the Financing Sources and/or their
respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Buyer and/or its Affiliates, on
the other hand, with respect to the financing arrangements contemplated
thereby. There are ( _x_ ) no conditions precedent, "flex" provisions or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing,
other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter and the Fee Letter,
and ( _y_ ) no other contingencies or rights that would permit the parties to
the Commitment Letter to reduce the total amount of the Financing contemplated
by the Commitment Letter, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment
Letter and the Fee Letter. As of the date hereof, each of the Commitment
Letter and the Fee Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and, to the Knowledge of Buyer,
each of the other parties thereto except ( _a_ ) to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors rights generally and ( _b_ ) that the availability of equitable
remedies, including specific performance, is subject to the discretion of the
court before which any proceeding thereof may be brought. As of the date
hereof, the Commitment Letter has not been modified or amended in any respect
(and no such amendment or modification is contemplated other than joinder
documentation to the Commitment Letter relating solely to the appointment of
additional agents, co-agents, arrangers, bookrunners, managers, or other roles
in respect of the Financing) and none of the respective commitments contained
in the Commitment Letter have been withdrawn, terminated or rescinded. As of
the date hereof, ( _i_ ) neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates is in breach
of the Commitment Letter and ( _ii_ ) to the Knowledge of Buyer, none of the
other parties thereto is in breach of the Commitment Letter, in either case,
in a manner that could materially adversely affect the availability of the
Financing. As of the date hereof, Buyer has no reason to believe that the
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter will not be available as of
the Closing and, to the Knowledge of Buyer, there are no facts or
circumstances that are reasonably likely to materially adversely affect the
availability of the Financing. Buyer has paid in full any and all commitment
fees and/or other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date hereof
under the terms of the Commitment Letter and will pay all other commitment
fees and/or other fees required to be paid under the terms of the Commitment
Letter as they become due. Upon the funding of the Financing in accordance
with the Commitment Letter, the proceeds of the Financing shall be sufficient,
together with

 



     

 

 



 

cash on hand of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, to consummate the Transactions,
including to pay the Closing Purchase Price and all fees and expenses of Buyer
related to the Transactions that are required to be paid on the Closing Date
and to satisfy all other payment obligations of Buyer contemplated by this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, in no event shall the receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of
the Financing, or the availability of any other funds or financing to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates, be a condition to Buyers obligation to consummate the
Transactions.

 



 

Section 5.5 _Legal Proceedings_. There are no Proceedings that are pending or,
to the Knowledge of Buyer, threatened against or relating to Buyer or any of
its respective properties, assets or businesses that would reasonably be
expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect. There is no Order imposed
upon Buyer or any of its respective properties, assets or businesses that
would reasonably be expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect.

investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or together
with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the Shares and is capable of bearing the economic risks of such
investment. Buyer acknowledges that the Shares have not been registered under
the Securities Act or any state securities Laws, and agrees that the Shares
may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or
otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act, except
pursuant to an exemption from such registration available under the Securities
Act, and without compliance with foreign securities Laws, in each case, to the
extent applicable.

 



 

Section 5.7 _No Broker_. Except for the investment banking firm previously
disclosed by Buyer to Seller, whose fee will be borne by Buyer, no broker,

and ( _ii_ ) except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth
in _Section 11.15(b)_, none of Seller Parent or any other Person on behalf of
Seller Parent makes or shall be deemed to make any representation or warranty
to Buyer or any other Person with respect to Seller Parent, express or
implied, at law or in equity, and Seller Parent by this Agreement disclaims

(including by omission) of any kind or nature of or relating to Seller, the
Acquired Companies or Seller Parent or any of their respective businesses or

Section 6.2 _Advisory Agreement Consents_.

 



 

(a) _Fund Approvals_. Subject to _Section 1.1-RRR_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, Seller shall cause Adviser to, as soon as reasonably practicable
following the date hereof, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit each
Fund Board (other than with respect to any Liquidating Fund) to ( _i_ )( _1_ )
with respect to each Fund that is not a Sponsored ETF, approve a New
Investment Company Advisory Agreement for such Fund, ( _2_ ) with respect to
each Sponsored ETF, approve an ETF Merger, and ( _3_ ) with respect to each
Sponsored Fund that is not a Sponsored ETF, ( _A_ ) nominate as Fund director
the nominees set forth on _Section 6.2(a)(i)(3)(A)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Nominee Directors_ ") and accept the resignation of the
directors set forth on _Section 6.2(a)(i)(3)(A)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, in each case effective as of the Closing Date, ( _B_ ) approve a new
distribution agreement for such Fund (" _Fund Distribution Agreement_ ") with
the applicable Buyer Distributor as a principal underwriter to such Fund, (
_C_ ) approve a new sub-transfer agent agreement for such Fund (" _Sub-TA
Agreement_ ") with the applicable Buyer Sub-TA as a sub-transfer agent to such
Fund, ( _D_ ) approve a new custodian agreement for such Fund (" _Custodian
Agreement_ ") with the applicable Buyer Custodian as a custodian to such Fund,
and ( _E_ ) approve a new administration agreement for such Fund ("
_Administration Agreement_ ") with the applicable Buyer Administrator as an
administrator to such Fund, and ( _ii_ ) solicit the shareholders of such Fund
to approve such New Investment Company Advisory Agreement or ETF Merger, as
applicable, and, in the case of each Sponsored Fund that is not a Sponsored
ETF, solicit the shareholders to elect the Nominee Directors (such Fund Board
and shareholder approvals and consents, the " _Fund Approvals_ "). For each
approval under the foregoing _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , ( _A_ ) such approval
shall be in accordance with the applicable provisions under the Investment
Company Act and ( _B_ )( _1_ ) as applicable, such New Investment Company
Advisory Agreement and new Fund Distribution Agreement to be effective on the
Closing Date and ( _2_ ) as applicable, such New Investment Company Advisory
Agreement shall be on substantially the same terms and conditions as the
Investment Company Advisory Agreement in effect on the date hereof with
respect to each Fund, including with respect to fees, and such new Fund
Distribution Agreement, new Sub-TA Agreement (taken together with the existing
transfer agent agreement), new Custodian Agreement and new Administration
Agreement shall be on terms that, taken together, shall provide for comparable
levels of service to the Funds and their shareholders and not result in higher
fees for the applicable Fund as in effect on the date hereof. Buyer shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof, use its reasonable
best efforts to ( _1_ ) obtain the required consents and approvals (including
by the board of trustees/directors of each Buyer ETF and, if applicable, the
shareholders of each Buyer ETF), necessary for each ETF Merger, and ( _2_ )
cause the Buyer ETF that will be party to each ETF Merger to prepare and file
with the SEC all necessary registration statements, prospectuses and proxy
solicitation materials, including a registration statement on SEC Form N-14
(or successor form thereto) necessary to solicit shareholder approval for each
Sponsored ETF with respect to an ETF Merger.

 



     

 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller and Buyer may mutually agree prior to
the in-person meeting of each Fund Board to make the approvals contemplated by
this _Section 6.2(a)_ that, with respect to the Fund Approvals, new
investment advisory agreements with Adviser should be substituted for New
Investment Company Advisory Agreements or ETF Mergers, as applicable. Seller
shall cause Adviser to, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof, use its reasonable best efforts to solicit each Fund Board to approve
the liquidation of each Liquidating Fund and, in the event such liquidation is
approved, use its reasonable best efforts to liquidate such Liquidating Fund
on or prior to the Closing Date, in each case subject to any requirements
imposed by the applicable Fund Board.

 



 

(b) _Rule 15a-4_. In furtherance of the obligations under _Section 6.2(a)_,
if the approval by the shareholders of any Fund of the applicable New
Investment Company Advisory Agreement or ETF Merger described in _Section
6.2(a)_ is not obtained prior to the Closing, then Seller may, after
consultation in good faith with Buyer, cause Adviser to use its reasonable
best efforts to solicit the Fund Board of such Fund to approve, consistent
with Rule 15a-4 under the Investment Company Act, an interim Investment
Company Advisory Agreement, to be effective immediately following the Closing
and containing substantially the same terms and conditions as the applicable
Investment Company Advisory Agreement of such Fund as in effect on the date
hereof (except for changes thereto reasonably necessary to comply with Rule
15a-4 under the Investment Company Act). If the provisions of Rule 15a-4 under
the Investment Company Act are utilized with respect to a Fund, then ( _1_ )
such Fund shall not be deemed to have consented in accordance with this
_Section 6.2_ to the Transactions until such Funds shareholders have
affirmatively approved, as applicable, the ETF Merger or a New Investment
Company Advisory Agreement to be effective on or prior to the termination of
the interim Investment Company Advisory Agreement and on substantially the
same terms and conditions as the applicable Investment Company Advisory
Agreement of such Fund as in effect on the date hereof, and ( _2_ ) Buyer
shall, and shall cause Adviser to, use reasonable best efforts to obtain such
required shareholder approval of such Fund as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the Closing (and in any event prior to the expiration of
such interim Investment Company Advisory Agreement).

 



 

(c) _Other Client Approvals_. Seller shall cause IMCO (with respect to the UMP
Accounts) and any Affiliate Advisory Client to provide (and not withdraw) all
required Advisory Client consents and approvals for IMCO and such Affiliate
Advisory Client, in each case as of the Closing to the extent IMCO (with
respect to any UMP Accounts) or such Affiliate Advisory Client is an Advisory
Client as of the Closing.

 



 

(d) _Cooperation_. Each Party shall ( _i_ ) reasonably cooperate with and
assist each other Party and their respective Affiliates in connection with
obtaining the approvals and consents sought pursuant to this _Section 6.2_,
and ( _ii_ ) promptly provide to the other applicable Parties in writing all
information concerning such Party and its Affiliates as is reasonably required
or otherwise reasonably requested in order to solicit each Fund Board and
otherwise seek to obtain the approvals and consents to be sought pursuant to
this _Section 6.2_ (including all information as is customarily included in
such solicitations, or requests for approvals and consents, prepared in
connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement).
Buyer shall cause all information relating to Buyer and its Affiliates
supplied by it for inclusion in such solicitations, or requests for approvals
and consents, at the time of the mailing or delivery of such solicitations or
any amendments or supplements thereto, not to contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or

 



     

 

 



 

omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. Each Party shall cause all information
relating to such Party and its Affiliates supplied by such Party or its
applicable Affiliate for inclusion in any solicitations, or requests for
approvals and consents, made under this _Section 6.2_ at the time of the
mailing or delivery of such solicitations or any amendments or supplements
thereto, not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

 



 

(e) _Consent Expenses_. Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible for fifty
percent (50%) of all of the Consent Expenses.

 



 

Section 6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality; Books and Records_ _;
Reasonable Assistance_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, upon reasonable advance notice, Seller shall
cause each Acquired Company to provide to Buyer and its authorized
representatives (including Financing Sources) during normal business hours
reasonable access to all books and records, relevant employees, Contracts and
facilities of such Acquired Company (in a manner so as to not interfere with
the normal business operations of such Acquired Company). Except as otherwise
expressly permitted pursuant to this Agreement, during the Interim Period,
Buyer shall not contact any of the Acquired Companies employees, vendors,
Advisory Clients, Transfer Agent Clients, or Contract counterparties, in each
case, without receiving prior written authorization from Seller and, if such
authorization is given, subject to the scope of such authorization; _provided_
, _however_ , that if Buyer engages with any of the same such vendors,
clients, or Contract counterparties of the Acquired Companies for purposes
other than Buyers evaluation, negotiation, consideration, consummation or
otherwise with respect to the Transactions, then Buyer shall be permitted to
contact such vendors, clients or Contract counterparties without the advance
prior written authorization of Seller solely in connection with Buyers
business relationship with such Persons in the ordinary course of Buyers
business consistent with past practice and for no other purpose (including
with respect to the Transactions).

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.3(a)_ and _Section
6.3(h)_, the Acquired Company granting access may withhold any document (or
any portion thereof) or information ( _i_ ) that is subject to the terms of a
non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement with a third Person, ( _ii_ ) that
would in the disclosing partys good faith opinion constitute privileged
attorney-client communications or attorney work product and the transfer of
which, or the provision of access to which, as reasonably determined by such
Acquired Companys counsel, may constitute a waiver of any such privilege, (
_iii_ ) if the provision of access to such document (or applicable portion
thereof) or information, as determined by such Acquired Companys counsel,
would reasonably be expected to conflict with any Applicable Law, ( _iv_ ) if
the provision of access to such document (or applicable portion thereof) or
information, would reasonably be expected to result in material competitive
harm to Seller or any of its Affiliates, ( _v_ ) pertaining to Taxes of Seller
or its Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) or ( _vi_ ) relating to
the sale process regarding the Acquired Companies or any potential alternative
transaction with respect to all or a portion of the Business, bids received
from other Persons in connection with such sale process or potential
alternative transactions and information and analysis (including financial
analysis)

 



     

 

 



 

relating to such bids, sale process or potential alternative transactions (in
the case of this _clause (vi)_, other than with respect to Buyers bid and
the sale process as it relates to Buyer); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in
the case of _subclauses (i)_ , _(ii)_ or _(iv)_ , Seller shall, and shall
cause the Acquired Companies to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer to establish
an appropriate confidential procedure or other work-around to provide Buyer,
its Affiliates and their respective representatives with access that is
reasonable under the circumstances, and in the case of _subclause (iii)_ ,
Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to, provide Buyer, its
affiliates and their respective representatives to any portion of such
document or information that would not reasonably be expected to conflict with
any Applicable Law.

 



 

(c) All information provided to Buyer by Seller, any Acquired Company or their
respective Affiliates pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise in connection
with the Transactions (including in connection with or pursuant to _Section
6.6_), shall be held by Buyer as confidential and as Evaluation Material (as
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) under the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement or Clean Team Material (as defined in the Clean Team
Agreement) and shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and Clean
Team Agreement (as applicable) in all respects, the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the
occurrence of the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the Clean Team
Agreement shall terminate automatically (and without any further action of the
parties thereto) solely to the extent of information and other Evaluation
Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) and other Clean Team
Material (as defined in the Clean Team Agreement) relating solely to the
Acquired Companies; _provided_ that the Confidentiality Agreement and the
Clean Team Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.

 



 

(d) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Seller and its Affiliates shall have
the right to retain copies of all books, data, files, information, materials
and records in any form or media of the Acquired Companies relating to periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date solely to the extent ( _i_ ) relating
to information (including employment and medical records) regarding the
Company Employees, ( _ii_ ) required by any Governmental Authority, including
pursuant to any Applicable Law or regulatory request or for purposes of
preparing or filing any Tax Return or participating in an audit or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes or ( _iii_ ) as may be necessary for Seller
or its Affiliates to perform their respective obligations pursuant to this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, in each case, subject to
compliance with all applicable privacy Laws and _Section 6.3(f)_.

 



 

(e) After the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause each Acquired Company to,
until at least the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing Date, retain all
books, records and other documents pertaining to the Business in existence on
the Closing Date and make the same reasonably available for inspection and
copying by Seller and its Affiliates and their respective representatives (in
each case, at Sellers expense), in each case, during normal business hours,
upon reasonable request and upon reasonable advance notice.

 



 

(f) From and after the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
and its and their respective representatives to, keep confidential, and not
use any information relating to or obtained from, Buyer or the Acquired
Companies or their Affiliates, regardless of the form in which such
information is communicated or maintained, and all notes, reports, analyses,
compilations, studies, files or other documents or material, whether prepared
by such party, its

 



     

 

 



 

Affiliates, or its representatives, that are based on, contain or otherwise
reflect such information, in the same manner as and to the same extent that
Buyer is required to keep Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) confidential, and not use such Evaluation Material,
under the Confidentiality Agreement, such confidentiality and use provisions
applied to Seller _mutatis mutandis_ ; _provided_ that nothing in this
_Section 6.3_ shall limit Sellers and Seller Parents use of such Evaluation
Material in evaluating and enforcing its rights under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and in defending claims from Buyer and Buyer Indemnitees.

 



 

(g) To the extent that any books and records relating to the Acquired
Companies or the Business are held or stored by Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Acquired Companies), the Parties agree that from and after the
date hereof, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, ( _i_ ) use
reasonable best efforts to transfer such books and records to the Acquired
Companies on or prior to the Closing Date, ( _ii_ ) to the extent such books
and records are not transferred to the Acquired Companies on or prior to the
Closing Date (including any books and records that are generated or created
following the Closing or in connection with the services provided pursuant to
the Transition Services Agreement), provide Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies) and their respective
representatives with prompt access to such books and records (or electronic
copies thereof), and deliver such books and records in a readable format as
reasonably required, upon request as promptly as possible but in any event
within any time period required to respond to any court or Governmental
Authority on a timely basis ( _provided_ , that, to the extent practicable
under the circumstances, Buyer and its Affiliates provide Seller or its
Affiliates with advance notice within a reasonable time), ( _iii_ ) transfer
such books and records to the Acquired Companies by no later than six (6)
months following the Closing Date (or, in the case of such books and records
to be transferred to Transfer Agent, within five (5) Business Days of such
earliest date thereafter that Transfer Agent is able to receive such books and
records) and ( _iv_ ) at the reasonable request of Buyer, place a litigation
hold or similar restriction on any such books and records as may be required
or advisable under applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing provisions of this _Section 6.3(g)_, during the Interim Period, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith an agreement to memorialize the
foregoing together with any additional commercially reasonable terms and
conditions with respect to the retention, maintenance and provision of such
books and records as may be mutually agreed to by the Parties.

 



 

(h) For the twelve (12)-month period after the Closing Date, subject to
_Section 6.3(b)_, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, and direct
its and their respective auditors and accountants to, reasonably cooperate
with (including by providing information to) Buyer and its Affiliates and its
and their respective representatives during normal business hours in
connection with the preparation of financial information required in
connection with Buyers SEC reporting obligations as may be reasonably
requested by Buyer in advance thereof.

 



 

Section 6.4 _Public Announcements_. Neither Buyer nor Seller shall make, nor
permit any of their respective Affiliates or representatives to make, any
public announcement or issue any public communication in respect of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Transactions without the prior
written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), in the case of an announcement or communication by
Seller or any of its Affiliates or representatives, or of Seller (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), in the
case of an announcement or communication by Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
except, in

 



      

 

 



 

each case, if such announcement or communication is required ( _a_ ) to obtain
consents and approvals, and to provide such notices and make such filings,
necessary to consummate the Transactions, ( _b_ ) by Law, rule or regulation
applicable to Buyer, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (and only to
the extent so required) or ( _c_ ) in the case of Seller and its Affiliates,
pursuant to internal announcements to Company Employees; _provided_ that in
the case of any such announcement or communication described in the preceding
_clauses (a)_ through _(c)_ , Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to coordinate or communicate such announcement
or communication with Seller or Buyer, as applicable, and incorporate such
other Partys reasonable comments thereto, prior to such announcement or
issuance.

 



 

Section 6.5 _Regulatory Matters; Third-Party Consents_.

 



 

(a) During the Interim Period, subject to the terms and conditions herein
provided, each of Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts (except
where a different efforts standard is specifically contemplated by this
Agreement, in which case, such different standard shall apply) to take, or
cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the Transactions (including the satisfaction, but not
waiver, of the conditions precedent set forth in _Article 7_). Each of Buyer
and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain consents of
all Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the Transactions. Each of
Buyer and Seller shall ensure that filings pursuant to the HSR Act and all
other filings required by Applicable Law with respect to the Transactions are
submitted promptly (and, in any event, within ten (10) Business Days after the
date hereof for a filing pursuant to the HSR Act and within twenty (20)
Business Days after the date hereof for all other filings, if any, required by
Applicable Law) after the date of this Agreement (and, absent the prior
written consent of the other Party, not withdraw any such filings) and shall
resubmit any such filings as soon as is reasonably practicable in the event
such filings are rejected for any reason whatsoever by the relevant
Governmental Authority. Buyer and Seller shall deliver as promptly as
practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act or other Applicable Law. Without limiting the foregoing, none of Buyer,
Seller or their respective Affiliates shall extend any waiting period or
comparable period under the HSR Act or other Competition Laws or enter into
any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the
Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the other Party hereto.
All filing fees incurred in connection with the HSR Act and any other
Competition Laws shall be borne by Buyer.

 



 

(b) Each of Buyer and Seller shall ( _i_ ) promptly notify the other Party of
any written communication made to or received by Buyer or Seller, as the case
may be, from any Governmental Authority relating to Competition Law (or any
other filings made pursuant to _Section 6.5(a)_) and regarding this Agreement
or any of the Transactions, and, if permitted by Applicable Law, permit the
other Party to review in advance any proposed written communication to any
such Governmental Authority and incorporate such other Partys (and any of its
outside counsels) reasonable comments to such proposed written communication,
( _ii_ ) not agree to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation or
inquiry relating to Competition Law (or any other filings made pursuant to
_Section 6.5(a)_) and regarding this Agreement or any of the Transactions
unless, to the

 



     

 

 



 

extent reasonably practicable, it consults with such other Party in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives such other
Party the opportunity to attend, and ( _iii_ ) promptly furnish the other
Party with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications
between it and its Affiliates and representatives, on the one hand, and such
Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the Transactions.

 



 

(c) In the event any claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding
(whether judicial or administrative) by any Governmental Authority or other
Person is commenced which questions the validity or legality of, or otherwise
challenges, the Transactions or seeks damages in connection therewith, Buyer
and Seller shall reasonably cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to
defend against such claim, action, suit, investigation or other proceeding
and, if an injunction or other Order is issued in any such action, suit or
other proceeding, to use reasonable best efforts to have such injunction or
other Order lifted or extinguished, and to cooperate reasonably regarding any
other impediment to the consummation of the Transactions.

 



 

(d) Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with each other and their
respective representatives in obtaining any other consents and approvals that
may be required in connection with the Transactions; _provided_ that pursuing
consents or approvals with respect to Advisory Agreements shall be governed by
_Section 6.2_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing herein shall obligate or be construed to obligate Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, any of the Acquired Companies) or
Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired
Companies) to make, or to cause to be made, any payment to any third Person in
order to obtain the consent or approval of such third Person under any
Material Contract.

 



 

(e) Subject to compliance of the Parties with their respective obligations in
this _Section 6.5_ and (with respect to any consents or approvals with
respect to Advisory Agreements) _Section 6.2_, Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, shall not have any liability whatsoever to the
other Party to the extent arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain
any such consents or approvals or make any such filings, or because of the
termination of, or default under, any Contract (except, with respect to the
Advisory Agreements, in connection with any amounts taken into account for
determining any Client Consent Adjustment Amount or any Consent True-Up
Payment Amount), in each case to the extent such consents, approvals, filings,
or Contracts are listed on _Section 3.2(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, _Section 3.3(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or _Section
4.2(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or are otherwise expressly
referenced in _Section 3.2(b)_, _Section 3.3_, _Section 4.2_, _Section
5.2(b)_ or _Section 5.3_.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Cooperation with Financing_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to provide and cause the Acquired Companies and its and the Acquired
Companies officers, employees, and advisors (including legal and accounting
advisors) to provide such cooperation to Buyer as may reasonably be requested
by Buyer in connection with obtaining the Financing necessary to complete the
Transactions (or any other financing), including the following: ( _i_ ) ( _x_
) providing the Required Financial Information and ( _y_ ) assisting Buyer
with the preparation of pro forma financial information and pro forma
financial statements to the extent reasonably requested by Buyer, ( _ii_ ) at

 



     

 

 



 

reasonable times and upon reasonable notice, participating in a reasonable
number of road shows, meetings, presentations, drafting sessions, due
diligence sessions and similar presentations to and with prospective lenders,
investors, underwriters, initial purchasers and rating agencies including
direct contact between senior management and representatives (including legal
and accounting) of Seller and the Acquired Companies on the one hand, and the
financial institution(s) providing the Financing on the other hand, ( _iii_ )
using commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the pledging of collateral
to the extent such pledging is required by the terms of the Financing, ( _iv_
) reasonably assisting in the preparation of customary bank books,
prospectuses, prospectus supplements, offering memoranda, confidential
information memoranda, lender and investor presentations, ratings agency
presentations and similar documents for the Financing, ( _v_ ) using
commercially reasonable efforts to provide assistance in the preparation of
the definitive financing documents as may be reasonably requested by Buyer, (
_vi_ ) reasonably assisting with the preparation of materials for rating
agency presentations, offering and syndication documents (including public and
private information memoranda and lender presentations), business projections
and similar marketing documents required in connection with the Financing and
all documentation and other information regarding the Acquired Companies
required for compliance with applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act, ( _vii_ )
executing and delivering, in each case effective only as of the Closing, any
guarantees, pledges and security documents, other definitive financing
documents or other certificates or documents contemplated by the Financing as
may reasonably be requested by Buyer (including a certificate with respect to
solvency matters in the form contemplated by the Commitment Letter), ( _viii_
) executing and delivering (or obtaining from its advisors), and causing the
Acquired Companies to execute and deliver (or obtain from their advisors),
customary certificates, accounting consent or comfort letters and other
similar matters reasonably requested by Buyer, including, in any case, the
consent of the Acquired Companies independent accountants to the inclusion of
their audit reports with respect to the financial statements furnished
pursuant to _Section 6.14_ in any registration statement of Buyer filed with
the SEC relating to the Financing or any other financing and causing such
independent accountants to provide customary comfort letters (including
"negative assurance" comfort, if appropriate) in connection with any offering
to the applicable underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents, and (
_ix_ ) taking all actions reasonably requested by Buyer or the Financing
Sources to facilitate arrangements for the discharge as of the Closing Date of
all Indebtedness of the Acquired Companies or Encumbrances on their respective
assets, including obtaining customary release letters, Encumbrance
terminations and other instruments of discharge. Seller consents to the
reasonable use of its and its Affiliates logos in connection with any
Financing in a manner customary for such financing transactions; _provided_
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or
reasonably likely to harm or disparage Seller or its Affiliates or the
reputation or goodwill of Seller or any of Sellers Affiliates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, ( _x_ ) nothing contained in this _Section
6.6_ shall require cooperation with Buyer to the extent it would encumber any
of the assets or properties of Seller or, prior to the Closing, the Acquired
Companies, require Seller or, prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies to
pay any commitment or other fee or make any other payment in connection with
the Financing prior to the Closing (unless simultaneously reimbursed by Buyer
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement), result in a material breach of any
Contract in effect as of the date hereof, impose any material liability on
Seller or, prior to the Closing, the Acquired Companies, or unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries,
and ( _y_ ) notwithstanding anything to the contrary, none of Seller, the
Acquired

 



     

 

 



 

Companies, or any of their respective directors, officers or employees, shall
( _A_ ) be required to take any action in the capacity as a member of the
board of directors of Seller, the Acquired Companies to authorize or approve
the Financing, ( _B_ ) have any liability or any obligation under any debt
financing agreement or any other agreement or document related to the
Financing or ( _C_ ) be required to incur any other liability in connection
with the Financing; _provided_ that _clauses (A)_ , ( _B_ ) and ( _C_ ) shall
only apply to the Acquired Companies and their respective directors, officers
and employees prior to the Closing.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller, reimburse the Seller
Indemnitees for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable out-of-pocket external attorneys fees and reasonable
out-of-pocket independent accountants fees) incurred by the Seller
Indemnitees at Buyers request in connection with the cooperation contemplated
by this _Section 6.6_ and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them
in connection with the arrangement of the Financing, any action taken by them
at the request of Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ and any information
utilized in connection therewith (other than information provided by Seller
and its Affiliates and Losses arising out of the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Seller or any of its Affiliates).

 



 

Section 6.7 _Section 15(f)_.

 



 

(a) Buyer acknowledges that Seller is entering into this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements in reliance upon the benefits and protections provided by
Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act as it applies to Adviser and the
applicable Advisory Clients. Buyer ( _x_ ) shall not take, and shall cause its
controlled Affiliates (including, after the Closing, Adviser) not to take, any
action that would have the effect, directly or indirectly, of causing the
requirements of any of the provisions of Section 15(f) of the Investment
Company Act not to be met in respect of the Transactions, and ( _y_ ) shall
not fail to take, and shall cause its controlled Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, Adviser) not to fail to take, any action if the failure to take
such action as would have the effect, directly or indirectly, of causing the
requirements of any of the provisions of Section 15(f) of the Investment
Company Act not to be met in respect of the Transactions. In that regard,
Buyer shall conduct its business and shall cause each of its controlled
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, Adviser) to conduct its business so
as to assure that, in each case to the extent within its, or its controlled
Affiliates, control:

 



 

(i) for a consecutive period of not less than three (3) years immediately
after the Closing, at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the members of the
boards of directors or trustees of each Fund are not ( _A_ ) "interested
persons" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company
Act) of the investment adviser of such Fund after the Closing or ( _B_ )
"interested persons" (within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment
Company Act) of the investment adviser of such Fund immediately prior to the
Closing; and

 



 

(ii) there shall not be imposed on any Fund an "unfair burden" (as set forth
and described in Section 15(f) of the Investment Company Act) as a result of

 



     

 

 



 

the Transactions, or any express or implied terms, conditions or
understandings applicable thereto.

 



 

(b) For a consecutive period of three (3) years immediately after the Closing,
Buyer shall not engage, and shall cause its Affiliates not to engage, in any
transaction or series of related transactions that would constitute an
"assignment" (as defined in the Investment Company Act) to any third party of
any Investment Company Advisory Agreement between ( _i_ ) either ( _A_ ) Buyer
or any of its Affiliates or ( _B_ ) Adviser, and ( _ii_ ) any investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act for which Adviser serves
as an investment adviser or sub-adviser as of the Closing without first
obtaining a covenant, for the benefit of Seller, in all material respects the
same as that contained in this _Section 6.7_; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the foregoing shall not apply in the event that Section 15(f) of the
Investment Company Act no longer applies to the Transactions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 6.7_ are intended only for the benefit of the
Parties and for no other Person.

 



 

Section 6.8 _D andO Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to indemnify, defend
and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under the applicable
Acquired Companys Organizational Documents in effect as of the date hereof,
each individual who on or prior to the Closing Date was a director, officer,
employee or agent of an Acquired Company with respect to all acts or omissions
by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request of an Acquired
Company at any time on or prior to the Closing Date. In addition, Buyer shall,
or shall cause the applicable Acquired Company to, pay or reimburse any costs
and expenses of any director, officer, employee or agent of the Acquired
Companies entitled to indemnification hereunder as incurred to the fullest
extent permitted under the applicable Acquired Companys Organizational
Documents in effect as of the date hereof.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall cause the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Companies
not to be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of individuals who at, or at any time prior to, the Closing
Date were directors, officers, employees or agents of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall, or shall cause one or more Acquired Companies to, obtain with
effect from and after the Closing Date and shall, or shall cause such Acquired
Company or Acquired Companies to, maintain in effect for six (6) years after
the Closing Date a "run-off" or "tail" directors and officers liability
insurance policy to the current policy covering the directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Acquired Companies and the officers of the Funds
and members of the Fund Boards with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Closing and having coverage limits in the same aggregate amount as provided in
the current policy for such six (6)-year period and terms and conditions
otherwise no less advantageous to the indemnitees than the terms and
conditions of the current policy covering the directors, officers, employees
or agents of the Acquired Companies and officers of the Funds and members of
the Fund Boards; _provided_ that the premium for such "run-off" or "tail"
liability insurance policy shall not exceed 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by Seller or its applicable Affiliate for comparable insurance
policies maintained in respect of the Acquired Companies (in which case Buyer
shall, or shall

 



     

 

 



 

cause one or more of Acquired Companies or Affiliates to, obtain as much
comparable insurance as available for 300% of the annual premium currently
paid by Seller or its applicable Affiliate for comparable insurance policies
maintained in respect of the Acquired Companies). The entire cost and premium
for such policy shall be paid in a single lump sum on or prior to the Closing
Date and shall be borne by Buyer.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.8_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each director, officer, employee or agent of
the Acquired Companies entitled to indemnification under this _Section 6.8_,
his or her heirs and are in addition to, and not in substitution for or
limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Affiliate Contracts, Affiliate Arrangements and Accounts_. Prior
to the Closing, Seller shall cause all Affiliate Contracts and Affiliate
Arrangements, including such Affiliate Contracts and Affiliate Arrangements
with respect to which there would otherwise be any liability or obligation on
the part of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including any Acquired Company
after the Closing), to be settled or otherwise terminated as such Affiliate
Contracts apply to the applicable Acquired Company prior to the Closing
without any liability or obligation whatsoever on the part of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including any liability or obligations arising from such
termination), except ( _a_ ) as and to the extent contemplated by the
Transition Services Agreement and the Transitional Trademark License Agreement
and ( _b_ ) for those Contracts or other transactions set forth in _Section
6.9_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. On or prior to the Closing Date,
except to the extent related to services to be provided under the Transition
Services Agreement after the Closing and the Contracts or transactions set
forth in _Section 6.9_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller shall cause
( _i_ ) all intercompany accounts payable owing to Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) by any Acquired Company and (
_ii_ ) all intercompany accounts payable owing by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Companies) to any Acquired Company, in
each case, to be forgiven, discharged, released, settled, cancelled (including
by way of capital contribution) or otherwise paid.

 



 

Section 6.10 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to retain the employment of the
Company Employees and Vendor Employees for the benefit of the Business (other
than any termination for cause). Prior to the Closing, Seller shall have, or
shall have caused its applicable Affiliates, to transfer the employment of
each Company Employee described in _clause (ii)_ of the definition of Company
Employee to Adviser. If, at any time following the date hereof and prior to
the Closing, the employment of a Company Employee or a Vendor Employee
terminates for any reason, or such individual otherwise ceases to be a Company
Employee or a Vendor Employee, Buyer and Seller shall consult in good faith to
determine whether a qualified replacement employee should be hired, and, if
the Parties so determine, Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
to, use their commercially reasonable efforts to hire or transfer a qualified
replacement employee to fill such position, _provided_ that the total
compensation and benefits costs associated with such qualified replacement
employee are substantially equivalent to the costs associated with the Company
Employee or Vendor Employee such Person is replacing. Such qualified
replacement employee,

 



     

 

 



 

once hired or transferred, would be deemed a Company Employee or Vendor
Employee, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise agreed to between an individual employee and Buyer,
for the period beginning on the Closing Date and continuing thereafter for
twelve (12) months (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Buyer shall provide, or
shall cause its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies to provide, Company
Employees who continue employment with the Acquired Companies following the
Closing (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with ( _i_ ) ( _A_ ) annual base
salary or wage levels that are at least equal to that provided to each such
Continuing Employee by the Acquired Companies on the Closing Date and ( _B_ )
incentive compensation opportunities that are, in the aggregate, at least
equal to the aggregate value of the incentive compensation opportunities
provided to such Continuing Employees pursuant to Sellers short-term and
long-term incentive compensation programs with respect to the calendar year
prior to the year in which the Closing occurs; _provided_ that Buyer and its
Affiliates shall be permitted to provide such incentive compensation
opportunities pursuant to the incentive compensation programs maintained by
Buyer and its Affiliates, and to provide such opportunities in the form of
cash-based or equity-based awards, in each case, as determined by Buyer in its
sole discretion, ( _ii_ ) employee benefits that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to the benefits provided to similarly-situated employees of
Buyer and its Affiliates, and ( _iii_ ) location of performance that is
substantially comparable to each such Continuing Employees location of
performance immediately prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that ( _x_ ) the sum of ( _1_ ) the value of the total compensation paid to
all Continuing Employees, in the aggregate, pursuant to _clauses (i)(A)_ and
_(i)(B)_ of this paragraph, plus ( _2_ ) the total value of the employee
benefits provided to all Continuing Employees, in the aggregate, pursuant to
_clause (ii)_ of this paragraph (excluding, for such purpose, the value of
any defined benefit pension plan benefits, discretionary matching
contributions made under retirement plans maintained by Seller or its
Affiliates, and retiree medical benefits), shall have an aggregate value that
is substantially comparable to the value of such compensation and benefits
that was provided to all Continuing Employees by the Acquired Companies
immediately prior to the Closing Date and ( _y_ ) for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing herein shall be deemed to require Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any
Acquired Company to provide Continuing Employees with any defined benefit
pension benefits, or retiree welfare benefits, or, except as contemplated by
_Section 6.10(h)_ hereof, deferred compensation, or limit the right of Buyer,
any of its Affiliates or any Acquired Company to ( _X_ ) terminate the
employment of any Continuing Employee at any time or ( _Y_ ) change or modify
any employee benefit plan or arrangement in accordance with its terms.

 



 

(c) Without limiting _Section 6.10(b)_ hereof:

 



 

(i) through the end of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs,
Buyer shall (or shall cause one of its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies
to) establish and maintain a variable pay program on terms that are no less
favorable than the terms of the USAA Management Company Variable Pay Program,
and each Continuing Employee who participated in the USAA Management Company
Variable Pay Program prior to the Closing shall be entitled to participate in
such program on terms that are no less favorable than those applicable to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date;

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) with respect to any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated by
Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any Acquired Company during the Continuation
Period, to the extent that Buyer determines that such termination would have
entitled such Continuing Employee to receive severance benefits pursuant to
the terms and conditions of the severance benefit plan or agreement maintained
by Seller, the applicable Acquired Company or Affiliate of Seller, as the case
may be, for the benefit of such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date, as set forth in _Section 6.10(c)(ii)_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Seller Severance Plans_ "), Buyer shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates or the Acquired Companies to, provide severance benefits to such
Continuing Employee, which shall be determined and payable in accordance with
the applicable Seller Severance Plan; and

 



 

(iii) with respect to any Continuing Employee whose primary work location is
changed by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or an Acquired Company during the
Continuation Period without the consent of the Continuing Employee, resulting
in an increase in commuting distance of more than fifty (50) miles for such
Continuing Employee, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates or the
Acquired Companies to, provide to such Continuing Employee relocation
benefits, which shall be determined and payable in accordance with the
relocation benefit program or agreement maintained for the benefit of such
Continuing Employee by Seller, applicable Acquired Company or Affiliate of
Seller, as the case may be, immediately prior to the Closing Date as set forth
in _Section 6.10(c)(iii)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(d) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Buyer, its Affiliates and the
Acquired Companies in which Continuing Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing (the " _New Benefit Plans_ "), each Continuing
Employee shall be credited with the same amount of service as was credited by
the Acquired Companies and their Affiliates as of the Closing under similar or
comparable Plans (including for purposes of eligibility to participate,
vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to receive benefits); _provided_ ,
that such crediting of service shall not operate ( _i_ ) to duplicate any
benefit or the funding of any benefit, ( _ii_ ) where such service was not
recognized under a comparable Plan of Seller or its Affiliates immediately
prior to the Closing, ( _iii_ ) for benefit accruals pursuant to any defined
benefit pension plan, ( _iv_ ) for purposes of any retiree health or retiree
welfare plan, or ( _v_ ) where prior service is not recognized for similarly
situated employees of Buyer and its Affiliates. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall use, or shall cause its
Affiliates and the Acquired Companies to use, commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that ( _A_ ) with respect to any New Benefit Plans in which the
Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing,
each Continuing Employee will immediately be eligible to participate in such
New Benefit Plans, without any waiting time, to the extent coverage under such
New Benefit Plans replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Plan in
which such Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately before
such commencement of participation (such plans, collectively, the " _Old
Benefit Plans_ ") and ( _B_ ) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and the Acquired

 



     

 

 



 

Companies to, cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and "actively-at-
work" requirements of such New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents or other beneficiaries, to the
extent any such exclusions or requirements were waived or were inapplicable
under any similar or comparable Plan. Buyer shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates and the Acquired Companies to, use commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure that any eligible expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and
his or her covered dependents or other beneficiaries during the portion of the
plan year of the Old Benefit Plan ending on the date such Continuing
Employees participation in the corresponding New Benefit Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents or other
beneficiaries for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such New Benefit Plan; _provided_ , that Seller delivers all
information regarding the expenses incurred in respect of any plan year for
each Continuing Employee prior to or as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing as is necessary for Buyer to satisfy its obligations
hereunder.

 



 

(e) Effective as of the Closing Date, unless otherwise provided herein, each
Continuing Employee shall cease to be covered by the Parent Plans and Seller
shall take any actions necessary to remove the Acquired Companies as a
"participating employer" or similar term from each Parent Plan. Seller or its
Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies) shall retain responsibility for,
and continue to pay, all medical, life insurance, disability, and other
welfare plan expenses and benefits for each Continuing Employee with respect
to claims incurred by such Continuing Employee or his or her covered
dependents prior to the Closing. Expenses and benefits with respect to claims
incurred by Continuing Employees or their covered dependents on or after the
Closing shall be the responsibility of Buyer pursuant to the New Benefit
Plans. For purposes of this _Section 6.10(e)_, a claim is deemed incurred by
a Continuing Employee ( _i_ ) in the case of medical or dental benefits, when
the services that are the subject of the claim are performed; ( _ii_ ) in the
case of life insurance, when the relevant death occurs; ( _iii_ ) in the case
of long-term disability benefits, when the relevant disability occurs; and (
_iv_ ) in the case of workers compensation benefits, when the event giving
rise to the benefits occurs. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
the Acquired Companies to, honor all Acquired Company Plans in accordance with
their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, subject to any
amendment or termination thereof that may be permitted by such Acquired
Company Plans, agreements or written arrangements. Nothing in this _Section
6.10(e)_ shall alter or otherwise affect the entitlement of Company Employees
or Vendor Employees who are retirement eligible or bridge retiree eligible as
of the Closing Date to benefits provided for retirees under the Parent Plans.
For the avoidance of doubt, ( _x_ ) effective as of the Closing Date, Seller
shall cause each Company Employee and each Vendor Employee who accepts an
offer of employment pursuant to _Section 6.10(i)_ participating in the Parent
Plans listed on _Section 6.10(e)(x)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to be
fully vested in his or her benefits pursuant to such Parent Plans, and ( _y_ )
from and after the Closing Date, Seller shall retain responsibility for, and
shall pay, benefits to Company Employees and Vendor Employees pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Parent Plans listed on, and described in, _Section
6.10(e)(y)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, and none of Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or any Acquired Company shall have any liabilities with respect to
such Parent Plans.

 



 

(f) In connection with each Company Employees cessation of participation in
the Parent Plans as of the Closing Date:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) With respect to each Continuing Employee who participated in the USAA
Corporate Bonus Plan immediately prior to the Closing, for the pre-Closing
portion of the calendar year in which the Closing occurs (the " _Pre-Closing
Bonus Period_ "), ( _A_ ) with respect to each such Continuing Employee that
is not a Retiree Eligible Employee, Buyer shall, or shall cause an Acquired
Company to, pay annual bonuses in respect of the Pre-Closing Bonus Period to
applicable Continuing Employees in Buyers ordinary course payment cycle and
based on the actual corporate performance score awarded by the United Services
Automobile Association Board of Directors (the " _USAA Board_ ") for such
calendar year, subject to the Continuing Employees continued employment with
an Acquired Company through the applicable bonus payment date, and ( _B_ )
with respect to each such Continuing Employee that is a Retiree Eligible
Employee, Seller shall pay (or shall cause to be paid) annual bonuses in
respect of the Pre-Closing Bonus Period to such Retiree Eligible Employee in
the ordinary course and as determined pursuant to the terms of the USAA
Corporate Bonus Plan based on the actual corporate performance score awarded
by the USAA Board for such calendar year; and

 



 

(ii) Seller shall pay (or shall cause to be paid), to each Company Employee
who participates in the USAA Long-Term Bonus Plan immediately prior to the
Closing Date and ( _A_ ) is not retirement eligible or bridge retirement
eligible under the terms of the USAA Long-Term Bonus Plan as of the Closing
Date, a prorated amount equal to ( _x_ ) one hundred percent (100%) of the
bonus that the Company Employee would have received under the terms of the
USAA Long-Term Bonus Plan, if any, based on the actual corporate performance
score awarded by the USAA Board for any performance period for which at least
one full calendar year has been completed prior to the Closing Date,
_multiplied by_ ( _y_ ) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of
full and partial months that have elapsed between the start of the three
(3)-year performance period and the Closing Date, and the denominator of which
is thirty six (36), which prorated amount payable under this _clause (A)_
shall be paid at such time that the bonus would otherwise be payable; or ( _B_
) is retirement eligible or bridge retirement eligible under the terms of the
USAA Long-Term Bonus Plan as of the Closing Date, an amount equal to one
hundred percent (100%) of the bonus that the Company Employee would have
received under the terms of the USAA Long-Term Bonus Plan, if any, based on
the actual corporate performance score awarded by the USAA Board for any
performance period for which at least one (1) full calendar year has been
completed prior to the Closing Date, which amount payable under this _clause
(B)_ shall be paid at such time that the bonus would otherwise be payable.

 



 

(iii) For the avoidance of doubt, from and after the Closing, except as
contemplated by _Section 6.10(c)(i)_ with respect to non-Retiree Eligible
Employees, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have any liability or
obligation to pay any amounts in respect of the USAA Corporate Bonus

 



      

 

 



 

Plan or the USAA Long-Term Bonus Plan, and Buyer shall provide, or shall cause
its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies to provide, incentive compensation
opportunities to Continuing Employees pursuant to the incentive compensation
programs maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates and as contemplated by
_Section 6.10(b)(i)(B)_.

 



 

(g) As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for providing, and
shall assume all liabilities in respect of, continuation coverage under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (" _COBRA_
"), or any relevant benefit continuation requirements under Applicable Law,
for any Company Employee who is an "MandA qualified beneficiary" (within the
meaning of COBRA) in connection with the transactions described herein.

 



 

(h) With respect to each of the Parent Plans set forth in _Section 6.10(h)_
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (each, a " _Deferred Compensation Plan_ "),
prior to the Closing, an Acquired Company shall establish a deferred
compensation plan and related trust, in each case, that is substantially
identical to the applicable Deferred Compensation Plan and related trust (each
such plan, a " _Mirror Plan_ " and, each such related trust, a " _Mirror
Trust_ "). Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, or shall cause its applicable
Affiliate to, transfer ( _i_ ) the liabilities of each Deferred Compensation
Plan to the applicable Mirror Plan and ( _ii_ ) assets having a value equal to
such liabilities under each Deferred Compensation Plan to the applicable
Mirror Trust. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 6.10_ to the
contrary, on or after the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Companies) shall be permitted to "freeze" the Mirror Plans with
respect to new participants, contributions and accruals, in each case, to the
extent permitted by the terms and conditions of such Mirror Plans.

 



 

(i) Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that Vendor
makes a written offer of employment to each Vendor Employee within a
reasonable period of time prior to the Closing. Each such offer, if accepted,
shall be effective as of the Closing and subject to Vendors customary hiring
practices. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
the offers provided to the Vendor Employees by Vendor provide for employment
terms and conditions that are equivalent to the terms and conditions
applicable to Continuing Employees under _Section 6.10(b)_ (other than long-
term incentives under _Section 6.10(b)(i)(B_), and excluding the requirements
described under _Section 6.10(b)(x)_) and _(d)_ hereof, which sections shall
be read as applying, _mutatis mutandis,_ to Vendor and the Vendor Employees
for this purpose. In addition, Buyer and Seller shall take the actions set
forth on _Section 6.10(i)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(j) After the Closing, ( _i_ ) within ten (10) Business Days prior to the date
that bonuses are paid by Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to _Section
6.10(f)(i)_ in respect of the Pre-Closing Bonus Period, Seller shall pay, or
cause to be paid, to Buyer (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account(s) designated by Buyer) an amount equal to the difference, if any,
between ( _x_ ) the bonus amounts that are payable in respect of the Pre-
Closing Bonus Period based on the actual corporate performance score awarded
by the USAA Board for the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, _minus_ (
_y_ ) all Pro Rata Bonus Amounts that were included as a component of the
Closing Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4_, and
( _ii_ ) within five (5) Business Days after the date that bonuses are paid
under the USAA Corporate Bonus Plan in respect of the calendar year in which
the Closing occurs, Buyer shall repay, or cause to be repaid,

 



     

 

 



 

to Seller (by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account(s)
designated by Seller) an amount equal to the difference, if any, between ( _x_
) the aggregate amount of all Pro Rata Bonus Amounts that were included as a
component of the Closing Purchase Price, as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.4_, and any amounts remitted pursuant to _clause_ ( _i_ ) hereof,
_minus_ ( _y_ ) the total amount, if any, of bonuses that are actually paid by
Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to _Section 6.10(f)(i)_.

 



 

(k) Buyer shall take the actions set forth on _Section 6.10(k)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(l) This _Section 6.10_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 6.10_,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section
6.10_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 6.10_
will create any third-party beneficiary rights in any current or former
employee, director or consultant of any Acquired Company in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Insurance_. Except as otherwise contemplated by the Transition
Services Agreement, Buyer shall be solely responsible for providing insurance
to the Acquired Companies for any event or occurrence after the Closing.
Subject to _Section 6.8_ and the provisions of the Transition Services
Agreement, Seller and the Acquired Companies shall maintain or cause to be
maintained in full force and effect the material insurance policies covering
the Acquired Companies until the Closing.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Employee Non-Solicit/Non-Hire_. For a period starting as of the
Closing Date and expiring four (4) years following the Closing Date, Seller
Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective employees and representatives acting at the direction of Seller
Parent not to, directly or indirectly, ( _a_ ) solicit, hire, or employ any
Continuing Employee of any Acquired Company, any Vendor Employee or any Person
listed on _Section 6.10(k)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (whether or not
such Person is a Continuing Employee of any Acquired Company) or ( _b_ )
encourage, solicit or induce any such Person to terminate such Persons
employment with the Acquired Companies or Vendor, as applicable; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the foregoing shall not preclude Seller Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries from ( _i_ ) soliciting such Persons pursuant to a general
solicitation performed by Seller Parent or its applicable Subsidiary that is
not specifically targeted at such Persons, ( _ii_ ) soliciting or hiring any
such Person (other than a Person named on _Section 6.10(k)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule) who has not been employed by such Acquired Company for a
consecutive period of six (6) months prior to the date of such solicitation or
hiring, or ( _iii_ ) soliciting or hiring any such Persons that Buyer
terminates at, following, or in connection with the Closing.

 



 

Section 6.13 _Non-Compete_.

 



 

(a) For a period starting as of the Closing Date and expiring four (4) years
following the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly, individually or jointly, engage
in, control, participate as a partner, principal or agent of,

 



     

 

 



 

or have an ownership interest in any Person engaged in, any Competitive
Business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in the first
sentence of this _Section 6.13(a)_ shall impede, prevent or otherwise
restrict Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries from holding or beneficially
owning ( _i_ ) equity or other ownership interests representing less than ten
percent (10%) of the outstanding equity securities of any Person principally
engaged, directly or indirectly, in a Competitive Business where such equity
or other ownership interest is passive in nature and no representative of
Seller Parent or any of its Subsidiaries sits on the board of directors or
other equivalent governing body of such Person, or ( _ii_ ) any debt
securities of any Person engaged, directly or indirectly, in a Competitive
Business, but solely to the extent such debt securities are not convertible
into equity securities of such Person (except if such equity securities, after
conversion, would be permitted as described in _clause (i)_ above). For the
purposes of this Agreement, " _Competitive Business_ " means the business of
managing, sponsoring, or providing investment advisory or subadvisory services
to open-end funds registered or required to be registered under the Investment
Company Act, or providing transfer agent services; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that "Competitive Business" will not include, or be deemed to include,
directly or indirectly, ( _A_ ) engaging in, or having an ownership interest
in any Person engaging in, any activities in connection with ( _1_ ) the
investments that are not open-end funds registered or required to be
registered under the Investment Company Act in Seller Parents or its
Affiliates general investment accounts or ( _2_ ) PandC, life, insurance and
banking products; ( _B_ ) owning any interest in or engaging in a limited
purpose brokerage business that receives referral fees, or otherwise referring
brokerage business to a third party that acquires IMCO and/or the brokerage
business of Seller Parent or its Affiliates; ( _C_ ) investing in or otherwise
owning an interest in any investment vehicle, fund, or investment adviser or
manager that primarily invests (or holds or manages investments) in real
estate or real estate-related assets or securities, including debt secured,
directly or indirectly, by real estate-related assets; or ( _D_ ) owning any
interests in Personal Capital or Square Mile or funds sponsored by Personal
Capital or Square Mile. By way of example, and without limiting the foregoing,
it is not a breach of this _Section 6.13(a)_ for Seller Parent or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, including USAA Real Estate Company (" _Realco_ "),
to directly or indirectly ( _x_ ) sponsor or otherwise be involved with funds
whose ultimate assets are primarily real estate-related, including funds that
target defined contribution plan participants, whether directly or indirectly,
via a vehicle that aggregates funding from multiple defined contribution plan
participants, or ( _y_ ) invest in, or arrange for the investment by other
Persons in, a primarily real estate-related fund sponsored in whole or in part
by Realco or Square Mile, and for Realco or Square Mile to provide advisory or
subadvisory services in connection with any such investment.

 



 

(b) If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction set forth in
_Section 11.11_ declares that any term or provision of _Section 6.13(a)_ is
invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that such court shall have the
power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to
delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and _Section 6.13(a)_ shall be enforceable as so modified
after the expiration of the time within which any such judgment may be
appealed.

 



 

(c) Seller Parent acknowledges and agrees that ( _i_ ) the agreements and
covenants contained in this _Section 6.13_ and _Section 6.12_ are ( _A_ )
reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal scope and in all other
respects, and ( _B_ ) essential to protect the value of the business and

 



     

 

 



 

assets of the Acquired Companies, and ( _ii_ ) Seller Parent and its
Subsidiaries have obtained knowledge, contacts, know-how, training and
experience and there is a substantial probability that such knowledge,
contacts, know-how, training and experience could be used to the substantial
advantage of a competitor of the Acquired Companies and to the substantial
detriment of the Acquired Companies.

 



 

Section 6.14 _Financial Statements_. As promptly as practicable (and in any
event no later than February 28, 2019), Seller shall cause to be prepared in
accordance with GAAP (applied on a consistent basis) and Regulation S-X, and
delivered to Buyer, true and complete copies of ( _1_ ) the audited combined
carve out balance sheets of the Acquired Companies as of December 31, 2016 and
December 31, 2017, and the related audited combined carve out statements of
operations, cash flows and stockholders equity for each of the fiscal years
in the two (2) year period ended December 31, 2017, in each case, as adjusted
to reflect the difference between the Acquired Companies and the Business
(collectively, the " _Audited Financial Statements_ "), and ( _2_ ) the
unaudited combined carve out balance sheets of the Acquired Companies as of
the last day of, and the related unaudited combined carve out statements of
operations for, the nine-month period ended September 30, 2018, in each case
for this _clause (2)_ , as adjusted to reflect the difference between the
Acquired Companies and the Business and which need not include footnotes.
During the Interim Period, ( _a_ ) Seller shall as promptly as practicable
(and in any event within thirty (30) days following the last day of each month
end and forty-five (45) days following each fiscal quarter end) cause to be
prepared in accordance with GAAP (applied on a consistent basis, except as may
be indicated in the notes thereto, if any), and delivered to Buyer, true and
complete copies of ( _i_ ) the unaudited combined carve out balance sheet of
the Acquired Companies as of the last day of, and the related unaudited
combined carve out statements of operations for, each month and for the
corresponding prior-year months, and ( _ii_ ) the unaudited combined carve out
balance sheet of the Acquired Companies as of the last day of, and the related
unaudited combined carve out statements of operations, cash flows and
stockholders equity for, each fiscal quarter and for the corresponding prior-
year fiscal quarters, in the case of each of _clauses (i)_ and _(ii)_ , as
adjusted to reflect the difference between the Acquired Companies and the
Business; _provided_ , that any such financial statements for any such fiscal
quarter in 2019, and for the corresponding prior-year fiscal quarters, shall
be prepared in compliance with Regulation S-X and reviewed by Sellers
independent auditors in accordance with Statement on Auditing Standards No.
100; and ( _b_ ) as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than
April 30, 2019) cause to be prepared in accordance with GAAP (applied on a
consistent basis) and Regulation S-X, and delivered to Buyer, true and
complete copies of the audited carve out combined balance sheet of the
Acquired Companies as of December 31, 2018, and the related audited combined
carve out statement of operations, cash flows and stockholders equity for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, in each case, as adjusted to reflect the
difference between the Acquired Companies and the Business (the financial
statements described in _clause (1)_ of this _Section 6.14_, the quarterly
financial statements described in _clause (a)_ and the financial statements
described in _clause (b)_ , collectively, the " _Interim Financial Statements_
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, ( _A_ ) the Audited
Financial Statements and Interim Financial Statements shall be prepared in a
manner that meets the SEC filing requirements under Rule 3-05 of Regulation
S-X if the SEC does not accept the Audited Financial Statements or Interim
Financial Statements when filed on a "carve out"

 



     

 

 



 

basis, and ( _B_ ) if the Closing occurs prior to April 30, 2019, Seller shall
cause the financial statements described in _clause (b)_ that are required to
be delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence to be prepared and
delivered to Buyer following the Closing and on or prior to April 30, 2019.

 



 

Section 6.15 _Assignments; Intellectual Property License_.

 



 

(a) _Assignment_. Effective as of the Closing, Seller Parent shall, or shall
cause its applicable Subsidiary to, assign to Adviser the Trademarks
identified on _Section 6.15(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) _Intellectual Property License_. Effective as of and only upon the
Closing:

 



 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Seller and Seller
Parent hereby grant and agree to grant, and shall cause each of their
respective Affiliates to grant, to each Acquired Company a non-exclusive,
perpetual, irrevocable, non-terminable, non-sublicenseable (except as provided
herein) and non-assignable (except as provided herein), royalty-free, fully
paid up, worldwide license, in connection with the current and future
operation of the Business under all Company Intellectual Property (other than
Trademarks, Domain Names, the Intellectual Property described in _clause (f)_
of the definition of Intellectual Property and software) that is owned by
Seller, Seller Parent or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies) as of Closing and that was used in connection with the
Business as of, or at any time during the twelve (12) month period prior to,
Closing.

 



 

(ii) The Acquired Companies may ( _A_ ) assign or sublicense, in each case, in
whole or in part, the license set forth in _Section 6.15(b)(i)_ to any
Affiliate, or in connection with a merger, consolidation, or sale of all, or
substantially all, of any of the businesses or any material portion of the
assets to which the license relates, so long as: ( _1_ ) the assigning or
sublicensing party provides the other party with prompt written notice of such
transaction; ( _2_ ) the assignment or sublicense shall not be deemed to
extend to other businesses or Affiliates of a successor and ( _3_ ) the
assignee or sublicensee agrees in writing to be bound by the applicable
provisions of this _Section 6.15_; and ( _B_ ) assume this license and
otherwise exercise all rights available to it with respect to any bankruptcy
event. In the event of a permitted assignment or sublicense hereunder, the
license granted herein shall bind the parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns and sublicensees to the applicable provisions of this
_Section 6.15_.

the distribution, licensing, offering and sale of the current and future

 



     

 

 



 

products and services of the Business, but in each case of _clauses (A)_ and
( _B_ ), not for the independent use of such Persons.

 



 

Section 6.16 _Efforts to Obtain Financing_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall use its
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
obtain the Financing on the terms and conditions applicable to Buyer within
its control described in the Commitment Letter in a timely manner but in any
case on or prior to the Closing Date, including using reasonable best efforts
to ( _i_ ) maintain in full force and effect the Commitment Letter in
accordance with its terms, ( _ii_ ) negotiate and enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions (including any
flex provisions set forth in the Fee Letter) not less favorable, in all
material respects and taken as a whole, to Buyer, than those contained therein
as promptly as practicable after the date hereof, ( _iii_ ) comply with all
material covenants and obligations applicable to Buyer in the Commitment
Letter and any definitive agreements with respect thereto, ( _iv_ ) satisfy on
a timely basis (or obtain a waiver of) all conditions applicable to Buyer in
such definitive agreements and ( _v_ ) in the event that all conditions
contained in the Commitment Letters or the definitive agreements related to
the Financing have been satisfied (except those that, by their nature, are to
be satisfied on the Closing Date) or waived, consummate the Financing at or
prior to the Closing Date. If at any time it becomes reasonably likely that
Buyer will be unable for any reason to consummate the Financing on the terms
set forth in, or on terms not materially less favorable to the borrowers than
those in, the Commitment Letter, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain replacement financing on terms not less favorable in all material
respects and taken as a whole, including from alternate sources, as promptly
as practicable after the occurrence of such event.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of the obligations set forth in _Section
6.16(a)_ above, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause its representatives to, deliver all
documents and instruments reasonably necessary to satisfy the conditions set
forth in the Commitment Letter and assist with the syndication or marketing of
the financing contemplated thereby.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall not amend, restate, replace, supplement or otherwise modify or
waive any provision in the Commitment Letter without the prior written consent
of Seller, if such amendment, restatement, replacement, supplement,
modification or waiver ( _i_ ) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing,
( _ii_ ) imposes additional conditions precedent to the availability of the
Financing that would reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the Financing on the Closing Date or (
_iii_ ) materially adversely affects the ability of Buyer to consummate the
Transactions. Buyer will promptly deliver to Seller copies of any amendment,
waiver, modification, or other change to the Commitment Letter. Buyer shall
keep Seller reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing and, upon request
of Seller, promptly provide to Seller executed copies of material definitive
agreements for the Financing. Buyer shall give Seller prompt written notice
upon becoming aware of, or receiving notice or any other communication with
respect to, any material breach of or any material default under, or any event
or circumstance that (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material

 



     

 

 



 

breach of or material default under, the Commitment Letter or any definitive
agreements related to the Financing, or any purported or actual termination,
withdrawal or rescission of the Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements
related to the Financing.

 



 

Section 6.17 _Notice of Certain Events_. Prior to the Closing, each Party
shall promptly notify each other Party of ( _a_ ) any written notice or other
written communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with and
with respect to the Transactions, ( _b_ ) any Proceeding commenced involving
such Party that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, ( _c_
) any occurrence of which it is aware that is reasonably likely to result in
any of the conditions set forth in _Article 7_ becoming incapable of being
satisfied, and ( _d_ ) to the Knowledge of Seller, any material compliance
with Law violations by an Acquired Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the
delivery of any such notice and the contents thereof shall not modify or
change in any respect the rights and obligations of the Parties under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.18 _No Negotiation_. Seller agrees that during the Interim Period,
Seller shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective Affiliates, and shall direct its and their respective
representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit the submission of
proposals or offers, or commence, participate in, or knowingly cause or
encourage, any discussions or negotiations, enter into any agreement, or
provide any confidential information, in each case, with respect to, or in
furtherance of, any transaction involving the acquisition by any Person (other
than Buyer or its Affiliates) of all or a majority of the equity securities of
either Acquired Company or all or a material portion of the assets of either
Acquired Company.

 



 

Section 6.19 _Invested Capital Commitments_. From and after the Closing,
except as required by Law, with respect to each Fund set forth on _Exhibit F_
that is a USAA Fund, Seller Parent hereby commits to cause its applicable
Affiliate(s) not to withdraw any Invested Capital from such Fund below an
amount equal to the minimum Invested Capital Amount set forth opposite such
Funds name on _Exhibit F_ under the column "USAA Capital Commitment" prior

_Commitment Period Expiration Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
foregoing restriction shall not apply to any Tax distributions or other
incidental distributions generally applicable to investors in the relevant
Funds. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, ( _a_ ) (
_i_ ) Seller and its Affiliates are permitted to withdraw any amounts from any
Fund so long as Seller and its Affiliates substantially concurrently replace
such amounts so that after such replacement the Invested Capital in such Fund
_equals_ the minimum Invested Capital Amount for such Fund, and ( _ii_ )
nothing in this _Section 6.19_ shall bind any foundation sponsored by Seller
or its Affiliates so long as, if such foundation withdraws any amounts from a
Fund, Seller and its Affiliates substantially concurrently replace such
amounts so that after such replacement the Invested Capital in such Funds
_equals_ the minimum Invested Capital Amount for such Fund, and ( _b_ ) on and
after a Commitment Period Expiration Date with respect to any Fund or from and
after the occurrence of a Fund Trigger Event with respect to any Fund, ( _x_ )
the restrictions described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be of
no further force and effect with respect to such Fund and any Invested Capital
in such Fund and ( _y_ ) Seller and its Affiliates shall be permitted to
withdraw

 



     

 

 



 

all or a portion of the aggregate amount of any and all Invested Capital in
respect of such Fund in accordance with such Funds withdrawal and redemption
procedures upon delivering a notice of such withdrawal to Buyer and/or Adviser
in respect thereof.

(a) From and after the date hereof through the expiration of the True-Up

right, title and interest in and to the 529 Agreement and ( _2_ ) assume all
of IMCOs duties and obligations under the 529 Agreement, in all respects (for
the avoidance of doubt, such that IMCO is released from all of its obligations
under the 529 Agreement with no further liability or obligation on the part of
IMCO), ( _ii_ ) obtain the prior written consent of the 529 Plan Manager to
effect the assignment and assumption described in _clause (i)_ above in

consent of the 529 Plan Manager to the deemed assignment of the 529 Agreement
with respect to the advisory services provided by Adviser under the 529
Agreement in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

(b) If the 529 Plan Manager will not provide its written consent to the
transactions described in _Section 6.20(a)_, then Buyer shall cause Buyer
Distributor to, on or prior to the expiration of the True-Up Period, and

any obligation to make any payment) to enter into a new Contract with the 529
Plan Manager, Adviser and Buyer Distributor with respect to the subject matter
of the 529 Agreement on terms and conditions substantially similar to the
terms and conditions of the 529 Agreement as in effect as of the date hereof
and otherwise providing that upon the entry into such new Contract, the 529
Agreement in effect on the date hereof shall be terminated in all respects
with no further liability or obligation on the part of IMCO or Adviser
thereunder, and Seller shall (and shall cause Adviser and IMCO to) provide
reasonable assistance to Buyer and Buyer Distributor in connection with the
foregoing.

 



 

(c) Seller shall cause IMCO to act as distributor under the 529 Agreement
until the earliest of (the " _529 Agreement Consent Period_ ") ( _i_ ) the
termination of the 529 Agreement in accordance with its terms, ( _ii_ ) three
(3) years from the Closing Date, ( _iii_ ) such consent referred to in
_Section 6.2(a)_ or such new agreement referred to in _Section 6.2(b)_ shall
have been obtained and ( _iv_ ) in the case of a Change of Control (as defined
in the 529 Agreement) or an assignment of the distribution function under the
529 Agreement, the 529 Plan Manager has given a consent thereto. Seller shall
pay to Buyer on a monthly basis all revenues earned by IMCO under the 529 Plan
(net of all direct expenses and the program fee payable to the 529 Plan
Manager) during the 529 Agreement Consent Period.

 



 

(d) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause Adviser and IMCO to enter into an

(f) Each of Buyer and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its
Affiliates, on the other hand, shall be responsible for its own out-of-pocket

Closing, Buyer shall cause Adviser and Transfer Agent to perform their
obligations (including payment obligations) under the Selected Dealer
Agreement and the Agency Agreement, respectively.

(a) This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing as follows:

 



 

(i) by the mutual agreement of Buyer and Seller;

 



 

(ii) by either Buyer or Seller, if ( _A_ ) there shall be any Law that makes
consummation of the Transactions illegal or otherwise prohibited or ( _B_ )
any injunction, decree or other Order of any Governmental Authority having
competent jurisdiction permanently enjoining Buyer or Seller from consummating
the Closing is entered and such injunction, decree or Order shall have become
final and nonappealable; _provided_ that the failure of the Party seeking to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)(ii)_ to fulfill in
all material respects any obligation or covenant under this Agreement (or
whose material breach of any representation, warranty or other agreement
herein) shall not have been the principal cause of, or have principally
resulted in, such injunction, decree or Order;

 



 

(iii) by Seller, if there shall be a breach by Buyer of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that
would result in a failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_, and such breach is either ( _A_ )
not capable of being cured prior to the Termination Date or ( _B_ ) capable of
being cured and has not been cured within the earlier of ( _1_ ) thirty (30)
days after the receipt by Buyer of a written notice of such breach from Seller
and ( _2_ ) the Termination Date;

 



     

 

 



 

 _provided_ that Seller shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)(iii)_ if Seller is then in breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein and
such breach would result in a failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions
set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_;

 



 

(iv) by Buyer, if there shall be a breach by Seller of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that
would result in a failure to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_, and such breach is either ( _A_ )
not capable of being cured prior to the Termination Date or ( _B_ ) capable of
being cured and has not been cured within the earlier of ( _1_ ) thirty (30)
days after the receipt by Seller of a written notice of such breach from Buyer
and ( _2_ ) the Termination Date; _provided_ that Buyer shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ if
Buyer is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or agreements contained herein and such breach would result in a failure to
satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or
_Section 7.3(b)_; or

 



 

(v) by Seller, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, if the Closing
shall not have occurred by 5:00 P.M. (prevailing Central Time) on the date
that is 270 days after the date hereof (the " _Termination Date_ ");
_provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)(v)_ shall not be available to a
Party whose failure to fulfill in all material respects any obligations or
covenants under this Agreement (or whose material breach of any
representation, warranty or other agreement herein) has been the principal
cause of, or has principally resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur
on or before the Termination Date.

 



 

(b) The termination of this Agreement shall be effectuated by the delivery by
the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement to the other Party of a written
notice of such termination and the basis under this Agreement for such
termination. If this Agreement so terminates, it shall become null and void
and have no further force or effect, except as provided in _Section 8.2_.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 8.1_ hereof, this Agreement shall become null and
void and of no further force and effect, without any liability on the part of
any Party; _provided_ that the provisions of _Section 6.2(e)_, _Section
6.3(c)_, _Section 6.4_, the last sentence of _Section 6.5(a)_, _Section
6.6(b)_, this _Section 8.2_, _Article 11 _(other than _Section 11.7_, which
shall terminate solely with respect to any obligation that is not to be
performed following such termination), and the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Clean Team Agreement shall survive any termination hereof in full force
and effect and Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall
share equally in any Consent Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this _Section 8.2_ shall relieve any Party of liability to the other Party
for Losses arising in connection with any willful breach by such Party of this
Agreement. For purposes of clarification, the Parties agree that if Buyer does
not close the Transactions when required

 



     

 

 



 

pursuant to _Section 2.2_ (for any reason, including if the Financing Sources
do not fund the Financing when required, other than as a result of Sellers
breach of its obligations under _Section 6.6_), such failure or refusal by
Buyer to close the Transactions shall be deemed to be a willful breach of this
Agreement by Buyer and Seller will be entitled to pursue any and all remedies
under Applicable Law, including the payment of any Losses resulting therefrom.
In no event will any Partys rights to recover Losses after termination of
this Agreement be limited, barred or prejudiced by any action, suit, claim,
investigation or proceeding for injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief as provided in _Section 11.7_ and subject to the limitations
set forth in _Section 11.7_, nor shall this _Section 8.2_ serve as any
limitation on the rights of Seller or its Affiliates under _Section 6.6(b)_
or for breach of the Confidentiality Agreement or the Clean Team Agreement.

Affiliates (including any Acquired Company after the Closing) to, take any
action on or after the Closing Date that would reasonably be expected to

Closing Tax Period, including the making of any Tax election, except as

Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim. Such notice shall specify in
reasonable detail the basis for such Tax Claim and shall include a copy of the
relevant portion of any correspondence received from the Taxing Authority.

 



 

(b) In the case of any Tax audit, examination, contest, litigation or other
Proceeding with or against any Taxing Authority (" _Tax Proceeding_ ") of or
with respect to any of the Acquired Companies for any taxable period ending on
or before the Closing Date (other than a Tax Proceeding described in _Section
9.6(a)_), Seller shall have the exclusive right to control such Tax
Proceeding; _provided_ that Seller shall not settle, compromise or abandon any
such Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of Buyer
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if
such settlement, compromise or abandonment would result in a material increase
in the Tax liability of Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Acquired Companies) for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(c) In the case of a Tax Proceeding ( _i_ ) of or with respect to any of the
Acquired Companies for any Straddle Period or ( _ii_ ) involving Taxes that
are Seller Indemnified Taxes and Taxes that are not Seller Indemnified Taxes
(and such Tax Proceeding for Taxes that are Seller Indemnified Taxes is not
separable from such Tax Proceeding for Taxes that are not Seller Indemnified

Tax Proceeding without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller shall
have the exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding with
respect to ( _i_ ) any Tax Return of Seller or any of its Affiliates (other

combined or unitary group that includes Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
(including any Combined Tax Return).

 



 

Section 9.7 _Tax Refunds and Credits_. Seller shall be entitled to any refund
or credit net of reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-party expenses
of Buyer of Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period. Buyer shall be entitled to
any refund or credit of Taxes of the Acquired Companies other than refunds and
credits to which Seller is entitled pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence. Any refunds or credits of Taxes of the Acquired Companies for any
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between Seller and Buyer in
accordance with the principles set forth in _Section 9.5_. Buyer shall, if
Seller

 



     

 

 



 

so requests and at Sellers expense, file for and obtain or cause its relevant
Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies) to file for and obtain any
refunds or credits. Seller shall have the right to control the conduct of any
such claim. If Seller pays (or if the Acquired Companies pay prior to the
Closing) estimated Taxes for any Straddle Period in excess of the amount
ultimately determined to be due for the portion of such Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date, and Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Acquired
Companies) obtains the benefit of such excess payment, Buyer shall promptly
refund such excess to Seller. Payments pursuant to this _Section 9.7_ shall
be made in immediately available funds within fifteen (15) days of the actual
receipt or realization of the applicable refund or credit (and shall include,
for the avoidance of doubt, any interest paid thereon, but shall be net of any
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-party expenses of Buyer and
Taxes to the Party receiving such refund or credit in respect of the receipt
or accrual of such refund or credit).

 



 

Section 9.8 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_.

 



 

(a) Seller and Buyer shall join in making an election under Code Section
338(h)(10) (and any corresponding election under state, local or foreign Law)
(a " _338 Election_ ") with respect to Buyers purchase of the Shares pursuant
to this Agreement. Buyer shall, within ninety (90) days after the Closing
Date, prepare and deliver to Seller for its review and consent, the allocation
of the deemed sales price of the assets of the Acquired Companies (and any
eligible Subsidiary for which a 338 Election is made) resulting from the 338
Elections (as required pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and
regulations promulgated thereunder) among such assets (the " _Section 338
Allocation_"). Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disputed items. If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on the Section 338
Allocation within sixty (60) days after Buyer provides the Section 338
Allocation, the Parties shall request the Accounting Firm to decide any
disputed items. The costs of the Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by
Seller and Buyer. The Section 338 Allocation shall be used in preparing
Internal Revenue Service Form 8883, and any similar forms under Applicable Law
with respect to Taxes. Seller and Buyer shall (and shall cause their
Affiliates to) report and file all Tax Returns (including amended Tax Returns
and claims for refund) consistent with the Section 338 Allocation, shall (and
shall cause their Affiliates to) take no position contrary thereto or
inconsistent therewith (including in any audits or examinations by any Taxing
Authority or any other proceeding) and shall file any supplemental Internal
Revenue Service Form 8883 necessary to reflect adjustments to the Purchase
Price as a result of an Earn Out Payment made pursuant to this Agreement.
Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate in good faith with each other in the
preparation and timely filing of any Tax Returns required to be filed in
connection with the making of such an election, including the exchange of
information and the joint preparation and filing of Form 8023 and related
schedules. Buyer and Seller agree to report the transfers under this Agreement
consistent with such elections and shall take no position contrary thereto
unless required to do so by Applicable Law with respect to Taxes pursuant to a
determination as defined in Section 1313(a) of the Code.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for the preparation and filing of all Section
338 Forms in accordance with Applicable Laws with respect to Taxes and the
terms of this Agreement and shall deliver such Section 338 Forms to Seller at
least thirty (30) days prior to the date such Section 338 Forms are required
to be filed. Seller shall execute and deliver to Buyer such documents or forms
(including executed Section 338 Forms) as are requested and are required by
any Laws in order to

 



     

 

 



 

properly complete the Section 338 Forms at least twenty (20) days prior to the
date such Section 338 Forms are required to be filed. Seller shall provide
Buyer with such information as Buyer reasonably requests in order to prepare
the Section 338 Forms by the later of thirty (30) days after Buyers request
for such information or thirty (30) days prior to the date on which Buyer is
required to deliver such forms to Seller.

 



 

(c) Seller agrees that any income and gain recognized as a result of, and in
accordance with, the making of a 338 Election will be included in the
consolidated federal income tax return of Sellers consolidated group and any
resulting Tax liability will be paid by Seller, as the common parent of
Sellers consolidated group.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Cooperation_. Buyer and each Acquired Company, on the one hand,
and Seller, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of any
Tax Returns pursuant to this _Article 9_ and the conduct of any Tax audit or
other Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon
the other Partys request) the provision of records and information which are
reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return or Tax Proceeding, making employees
and personnel available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the
provision of any reasonably requested power of attorney. Buyer shall retain
all Tax Returns, schedules, and work papers and all material records and other
documents relating thereto of the Acquired Companies until the expiration of
the later of ( _a_ ) the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date and (
_b_ ) the date on which Taxes may no longer be assessed under the applicable
statutes of limitation, including any waivers or extensions thereof.

 



 

Section 9.10 _Coordination; Survival_. Except as provided for in _Section
10.4(a)_, _Section 10.4(b)_, _Section 10.4(c)_, _Section 10.4(f)_, and
_Section 10.4(i)_, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, claims for indemnification with respect to Taxes of the Acquired
Companies shall be governed exclusively by this _Article 9_, and the
indemnification provisions of this _Article 9_ represent the sole and
exclusive remedy of a Party for any such claims. The indemnification
provisions of this _Article 9_ shall survive until thirty (30) days after the
expiration of the relevant Tax statutes of limitation.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 10**

 



 

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

Section 10.1 _Survival_. Subject to the provisions of _Section 10.5_, ( _a_ )

delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_ or _Section 7.3(c)_, and all
covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement which by
their terms are to be performed at or prior to the Closing, shall survive the

Fraud shall survive the Closing Date for a period of six (6) years after the
Closing Date,

 



      

 

 



 

and ( _c_ ) all other covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in
this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date in accordance with their
respective terms and until fully performed, but not to exceed a period of six
(6) years after the Closing Date in the event of a breach of any such
covenant.

 



 

Section 10.2 _Indemnification by Seller_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to this _Article 10_, Seller
shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and each of its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates (including, following the Closing, the Acquired Companies) and
each of their respective officers, directors, employees, equity holders,
members, partners, agents, representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and pay or
reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, any and all Losses arising from _(i)_
any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in _Article 3_ or
_Article 4_ or in any certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 7.2(c)_
(except for Fraud), _(ii)_ any breach by Seller of any of its covenants or
agreements contained herein (other than, if applicable, those contained in
_Article 9_, which are governed exclusively by _Article 9_), _(iii)_ solely
to the extent it is finally determined that a Buyer Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification hereunder, the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of such Buyer
Indemnitees indemnification rights under this Agreement, _(iv)_ Fraud, _(v)_
claims or Actions brought or made by or on behalf of any Affiliate Advisory
Client against Buyer, the Acquired Companies or their Affiliates for actions
or omissions of the Acquired Companies during the period prior to the Closing,
or _(vi)_ the matter set forth on _Section 10.2(a)(vi)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
10.2_, ( _i_ ) Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification or
recovery, or to otherwise make a claim for indemnity or recovery, under
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ ( _A_ ) for any individual claim or group of related
claims unless the amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable pursuant to
_Section 10.2(a)(i)_ with respect to such claim or group of related claims
exceeds an amount equal to $200,000 (the " _Per Claim Threshold_ "), and ( _B_
) unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be
payable exceeds, on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to 0.5% of the Closing
Purchase Price (the " _Indemnification Deductible_ "), and then only to the
extent such Losses exceed the Indemnification Deductible; and ( _ii_ ) ( _A_ )
any individual claims or group of related claims for amounts less than the Per
Claim Threshold shall be ignored and disregarded for purposes of determining
whether the Indemnification Deductible has been exceeded, and ( _B_ ) the
Indemnification Deductible and Per Claim Threshold shall not apply with
respect to any claim by a Buyer Indemnitee for indemnification or recovery for
any breach of any Fundamental Representation of Seller or Fraud.

 



 

Section 10.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to this _Article 10_, Buyer shall
defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and each of its Subsidiaries and
Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, equity
holders, members, partners, agents, representatives, successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and pay or
reimburse the Seller Indemnitees for, any and all Losses arising from ( _i_ )
any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer in _Article 5_ or
in any certificate delivered pursuant

 



     

 

 



 

to _Section 7.3(c)_, ( _ii_ ) any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants or
agreements contained herein, and ( _iii_ ) solely to the extent it is finally
determined that a Seller Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification hereunder,
the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the enforcement of such Seller Indemnitees indemnification
rights under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
10.3_, ( _i_ ) Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification or
recovery, or to otherwise make a claim for indemnity or recovery, under
_Section 10.3(a)(i)_ ( _A_ ) for any individual claim or group of related
claims unless the amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable pursuant to
_Section 10.3(a)(i)_ with respect to such claim or group of related claims
exceeds an amount equal to the Per Claim Threshold, and ( _B_ ) unless and
until the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable exceeds,
on a cumulative basis, an amount equal to the Indemnification Deductible, and
then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Indemnification Deductible; and
( _ii_ ) ( _A_ ) any individual claims or group of related claims for amounts
less than the Per Claim Threshold shall be ignored and disregarded for
purposes of determining whether the Indemnification Deductible has been
exceeded, and ( _B_ ) the Indemnification Deductible and Per Claim Threshold
shall not apply with respect to any claim by a Seller Indemnitee for
indemnification or recovery for any breach of any Fundamental Representation
of Buyer or Fraud.

 



 

Section 10.4 _Indemnification Generally; Certain Limitations_. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer and Seller agree, for
themselves and on behalf of Buyer Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees:

 



 

(a) Except with respect to claims for indemnification or recovery pursuant to
_Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_, as applicable, for a breach of any
Fundamental Representation, neither the Buyer Indemnitees nor the Seller
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification or recovery for any claim
under _Section 10.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 10.3(a)(i)_, as applicable, for any
monetary amount in respect of Losses in excess of the Indemnity Cap in the
aggregate for all claims for indemnification or recovery under _Section
10.2(a)(i)_ or _Section 10.3(a)(i)_, as applicable, brought by such Buyer
Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as applicable, individually or
collectively. Neither the Buyer Indemnitees nor the Seller Indemnitees shall
be entitled to indemnification or recovery for claims for indemnification or
recovery pursuant to _Article 9_, _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_, as
applicable, or otherwise under or in connection with this Agreement for any
monetary amount in respect of Losses in excess of the Closing Purchase Price
(as finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4(c)_ and paid by Buyer to
Seller pursuant to this Agreement) in the aggregate for any and all claims
(whether for Fundamental Representations, Fraud or otherwise under or in
connection with this Agreement) for indemnification or recovery brought by
such Buyer Indemnitees or such Seller Indemnitees, individually or
collectively with any other claims.

 



 

(b) The amount of any and all Losses indemnifiable pursuant to _Section 9.1_,
_Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_ shall be determined net of (i) any amounts
actually recovered by the applicable Indemnified Party under insurance
policies or other collateral sources (including contractual indemnities of any
Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) with respect to such
Losses, in each case, after deducting the amount of any deductible, retention
or other reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred
by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith, and (ii) any Tax benefits
actually realized (in the form of cash actually received or

 



     

 

 



 

reduction in cash Taxes actually paid) in the year the Loss is incurred or in
any prior taxable year by the applicable Indemnified Party with respect to
such Losses. In any case where an Indemnified Party actually realizes such Tax
benefits or actually recovers under insurance policies or from other
collateral sources, any amount in respect of a matter for which such
Indemnified Party was previously indemnified pursuant to _Section 9.1_,
_Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_, as applicable, in each case, to the extent
not already taken into account in determining the indemnified Losses pursuant
to this _Section 10.4(b)_ and only to the extent that the Indemnified Party
would otherwise retain an amount greater than the full amount of such Losses
actually sustained by the Indemnified Party as a result of the underlying
claim with respect to such Losses, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay
over to the applicable Indemnifying Party, the amount so recovered or
realized, but not in excess, in the aggregate, of an amount equal to the
aggregate amount by which such Indemnified Party was previously indemnified
pursuant to _Section 9.1_, _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_, as applicable.

 



 

(c) An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section 9.1_, _Section 10.2_ or _Section 10.3_, as applicable, for any
Loss to the extent that with respect to any Buyer Indemnitee, such Loss was
taken into account, directly or indirectly, in the Closing Purchase Price or
any of the components thereof, in each case, as finally determined pursuant to
_Section 2.4(c)_. To the extent required under applicable Law, each
Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Losses incurred by such party.

 



 

(d) No right of indemnification hereunder shall be limited by reason of
investigation or audit conducted before or after the Closing or the knowledge
by any Buyer Indemnitee of any information that would cause one or more of the
representations and warranties made by Seller to be inaccurate, or the
decision of any Party to complete the Closing.

 



 

(e) In all cases in determining whether there has been a breach of a
representation or warranty or in calculating the amount of any Loss with
respect to a breach of any representation or warranty set forth herein or in
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, such representations and
warranties shall be read without regard to any materiality qualifier
(including any reference to Material Adverse Effect) contained therein, except
in respect of the last sentence of _Section 4.4_, the first sentence of
_Section 4.6_, and the use of the term "Material Contract" (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, the definition of "Material Contract").

 



 

(f) If an Indemnifying Party makes an indemnification payment to an
Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss, then such Indemnifying Party shall
be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any and all related rights
and remedies of such Indemnified Party under any insurance policy with respect
to such Loss, except with respect to amounts relating to such Loss that have
not yet been recovered by such Indemnified Party (or any other such Person
entitled to indemnification hereunder) or if such Loss relates to Fraud or any
criminal act. If any portion of any Loss to be reimbursed by the Indemnifying
Party is actually covered, in whole or in part, by third-party insurance
coverage of the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall give reasonably
prompt notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party.

 



 

(g) An indemnity payment made pursuant to this Agreement shall be treated as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise
required by Applicable Law or an audit or other administrative or judicial
action with respect to the Indemnified Party or

 



     

 

 



 

Indemnifying Party causes any such payment not to constitute an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes.

 



 

(h) NO PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, LOST PROFITS OR LOST REVENUE, WHETHER BASED
ON CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, LAW, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE AND WHETHER OR
NOT ARISING FROM ANY OTHER PARTYS SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE,
STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OR LIABILITY (" _NON-REIMBURSABLE DAMAGES_ "),
EXCEPT IF, AND SOLELY TO THE EXTENT THAT, ANY SUCH NON-REIMBURSABLE DAMAGES
ARE ( _I_ ) ACTUALLY RECOVERED AGAINST AN INDEMNIFIED PARTY PURSUANT TO A
THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OR ( _II_ ) REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.

 



 

(i) All indemnifiable Losses under this _Article 10_ and _Article 9_ shall
be determined without duplication of recovery under other provisions of this
Agreement, any certificate delivered in connection with this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the immediately
preceding sentence, if a set of facts, conditions, events or occurrences
constitutes a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement that is subject to an indemnification obligation under this _Article
10_ and/or _Article 9_, then only one recovery of indemnifiable Losses shall
be permitted in respect thereof, and in no event shall there be any
duplication of indemnification, payments or recovery under different
provisions of this Agreement arising out of the same facts, conditions, events
or occurrences.

 



 

(j) Subject to the limitations contained in _Section 10.2(b)_, _Section
10.3(b)_ and the other provisions of this _Section 10.4_, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall have the right to offset against any amount otherwise
payable by Buyer to Seller under this Agreement, including against any Earn
Out Payments or Managed Money Revenue Share Payments, to satisfy any amounts
payable by Seller to the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to this _Article 10_
solely to the extent that ( _i_ ) such amounts payable by Seller to the Buyer
Indemnitees shall have been finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction (and not subject to appeal) under the terms of this Agreement to
be due and payable by Seller to a Buyer Indemnitee hereunder and ( _ii_ )
Seller shall not have paid such amounts to the applicable Buyer Indemnitee (or
its designee) within ten (10) Business Days after the date of such final
determination.

 



 

Section 10.5 _Notification of Claims; Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties from whom
indemnification or recovery is sought under this Agreement (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of any such claim in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under this _Article 10_, as applicable, describing,
to the extent known, in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with
respect to the subject matter of such claim and, if applicable, including
copies of all material written evidence thereof and indicating the estimated
amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Party in connection therewith (a " _Claim Notice_
"); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to promptly provide such Claim
Notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations
under this _Article 10_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced by such failure. The Parties agree that ( _i_ ) in this
_Article 10_ they intend to

 



     

 

 



 

shorten (in the case of the limited survival periods specified in _Section
10.1_) the applicable statute of limitations period with respect to certain
claims hereunder to the extent provided in _Section 10.1_, ( _ii_ ) Claim
Notices for claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any
applicable survival period specified in _Section 10.1_ for such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement and ( _iii_ ) any claims for
indemnification for which a Claim Notice is not delivered in accordance with
the terms and conditions of this _Section 10.5_ prior to the expiration of
the applicable survival periods set forth in _Section 10.1_ shall be
expressly barred and are hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waived;
_provided_ that if, prior to such applicable date, an Indemnified Party shall
have notified in writing any Indemnifying Party in accordance with the
requirements of this _Section 10.5_ of a claim for indemnification under this
_Article 10_ (whether or not formal legal action shall have been commenced
based upon such claim), such applicable representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement relating to such claim shall survive such survival period and such
claim shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with this
_Article 10_ notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date.

 



 

(b) Upon an Indemnifying Partys receipt of a Claim Notice from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to (and in accordance with the requirements of) this _Section
10.5_ in respect of a pending or threatened claim or demand by a third party
that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or will reasonably give
rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (such claim or demand
being a " _Third-Party Claim_ " and including any such pending or threatened
claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party), the
Indemnifying Party may, by written notice delivered to the Indemnified Party
within ten (10) Business Days after the date of receipt of a Claim Notice in
respect of such Third-Party Claim, assume the defense and control of such
Third-Party Claim (including the right to negotiate a settlement or compromise
of such Third-Party Claim), with its own counsel and at its own expense and
the Indemnified Party shall, at its sole cost and expense, reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith, except that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense and control of
such Third-Party Claim if such Third-Party Claim relates to or alleges any
criminal conduct; _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall permit the
Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of
such Third-Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense, except
that the Indemnifying Party shall be responsible for the fees and expenses of
one separate co-counsel for the Indemnified Party to the extent the
Indemnified Party is advised by its outside counsel that either the counsel
the Indemnifying Party has selected has a conflict of interest in respect of
the defense of such Third-Party Claim or there are non-frivolous legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party that are materially different from
or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
if the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense and control of such Third-Party
Claim, such Indemnifying Party may not, in any circumstance, except with the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) settle or compromise (or agree
to settle or compromise), or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to, such Third-Party Claim unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (
_i_ ) includes as a term thereof a full and unconditional written release by
the third party asserting such Third-Party Claim of all applicable Indemnified
Parties from all liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim, ( _ii_ )
does not impose injunctive or other equitable relief on the Indemnified Party
or any of its Affiliates, or ( _iii_ ) does not involve a finding or admission
of any violation of applicable Law by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates. If the Indemnifying Party

 



     

 

 



 

( _A_ ) does not notify the Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days
after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys Claim Notice in respect of such
Third-Party Claim that such Indemnifying Party elects to undertake the defense
and control thereof or ( _B_ ) notifies such Indemnified Party that it does
not elect to undertake the defense and control thereof, then, in each case,
such Indemnified Party shall have the right to contest, defend, settle or
compromise such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled
to recover from the Indemnifying Party its reasonable and documented out-of-
pocket costs and expenses in connection therewith (including reasonable
attorneys fees and disbursements); _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Indemnified
Party may, in any circumstance, settle or compromise (or agree to settle or
compromise) a Third-Party Claim absent the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), it being understood that if an Indemnified Party
enters into or agrees to enter into any settlement or compromise absent such
prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (except where such prior
written consent is unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by the
Indemnifying Party), then the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to have
irrevocably and unconditionally waived for all purposes under this Agreement
any right to indemnity or recovery from the Indemnifying Party in respect of
such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(c) The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim in respect of
which indemnity may be sought hereunder and each of Buyer and Seller (or a
duly authorized representative of such Party) shall (and shall cause the
relevant Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, as the case may be, to)
furnish such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences,
discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably
requested in connection therewith to ensure the adequate defense or
prosecution of any such Third-Party Claim.

 



 

(d) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a Claim Notice for indemnity
from an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section 10.5_ that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within ten (10) Business Days following its receipt of such
Claim Notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes all or a portion of its
liability to the Indemnified Party under this _Article 10_. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so notify the Indemnified Party within such ten
(10)-Business Day period of any such dispute, then the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have agreed to such indemnification claim and the
Indemnifying Partys right to dispute such indemnification claim under this
_Section 10.5(d)_ shall be expressly barred and is hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally waived. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with
and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the validity of any such
claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party. The procedures set forth in
_Section 10.5(b)_ shall not apply to any indemnification claim that does not
involve a Third-Party Claim.

 



 

Section 10.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
except in the case where a Party seeks to obtain specific performance pursuant
to _Section 11.7_, the Parties hereby agree that, from and after the Closing,
the sole and exclusive remedy of a Party in connection herewith (including for
any breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement) shall be the applicable indemnification
rights set forth in this _Article 10_ and _Article 9_. In furtherance of the
foregoing, subject to _Section 11.7_ and the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article 10_ and _Article 9_, effective from and after the
Closing, except for any rights, claims

 



     

 

 



 

or obligations arising under this Agreement or any other Ancillary Agreement,
( _i_ ) Buyer hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and forever
discharges, on behalf of itself and any other Buyer Indemnitee, from and after
the Closing, any and all rights, charges, complaints, obligations, promises,
agreements, controversies, liabilities, damages, suits, costs, Losses, debts,
expenses, claims and causes of action (of every type, kind, nature,
description or character, whatsoever, whether known or unknown, contingent or
otherwise, in law or in equity, based upon contract, tort, strict liability or
otherwise, without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of
different or additional facts or circumstances) (collectively, " _Claims_ ")
any Buyer Indemnitee may have against Seller or any of its Affiliates, or
their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling
Persons, direct or indirect equity holders or members, agents or
representatives, and successors or assigns of each of the foregoing and ( _ii_
) Seller hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and forever discharges,
on behalf of itself and any other Seller Indemnitee, from and after the
Closing, any and all Claims any Seller Indemnitee may have against Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Companies),
or their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling
Persons, direct or indirect equity holders or members, agents or
representatives, and successors or assigns of each of the foregoing.

 **MISCELLANEOUS**

 



 

Section 11.1 _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended, altered
or modified except by written instrument executed by the Parties. Any
agreement on the part of the Parties to waive any term or provision of this
Agreement shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of the Party or Parties against whom the waiver is to be effective.
No such waiver shall constitute a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other inaccuracy, breach or failure to strictly comply with the
provisions of this Agreement. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising
any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section 11.7_,

Adverse Effect" and this _Section 11.1_ (and any definition or provision of
this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, supplement or waiver
of such provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing
provisions in any respect) may not be amended, altered or modified in a manner
that materially adversely affects the Financing Sources without the prior
written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

Section 11.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, the Ancillary Agreements, the Confidentiality Agreement,
the Clean Team Agreement and any other schedules, certificates, lists and
documents referred to herein, and any other documents executed by any of the
Parties simultaneously herewith or therewith), constitutes the entire

Section 11.4 _Interpretation_.

Agreement to ( _i_ ) Articles, Sections, Schedules or Exhibits, such reference
shall be to an Article of, Section of, Schedule to or Exhibit to this
Agreement; ( _ii_ ) "paragraphs" or "clauses" shall be deemed references to
separate paragraphs or clauses of the section or subsection in which the
reference occurs; ( _iii_ ) any Contract (including this Agreement) or Law
shall be deemed references to such Contract or Law as amended, supplemented or
modified from time to time in accordance with its terms and the terms hereof,
as applicable, and in effect at any given time (and, in the case of any Law,
to any successor provisions thereof); ( _iv_ ) any Person shall be deemed
references to such Persons successors and permitted assigns, and in the case
of any Governmental Authority, to any Person(s) succeeding to its functions
and capacities; and ( _v_ ) any Law shall be deemed references to all rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder.

 



 

(b) The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Whenever the words "include," "includes," or "including" are used in this
Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." "Writing," "written," and comparable terms refer to printing,
typing and other means of reproducing words (including electronic media) in a
visible form.

 



 

(d) If a term is defined as one part of speech (such as a noun), it shall have
a corresponding meaning when used as another part of speech (such as a verb).
Terms defined in the singular have the corresponding meanings in the plural,

required to be done or taken not on such day but on the first succeeding
Business Day thereafter. The phrases "the date of this Agreement," "the date
hereof" and terms of similar import, unless the context otherwise requires,
shall be deemed to refer to the date set forth in the preamble hereto.

 



 

(f) The Parties acknowledge that each Party and its attorney has reviewed this
Agreement and that any rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities
are to be resolved

 



     

 

 



 

against the drafting Party, or any similar rule operating against the drafter
of an agreement, shall not be applicable to the construction or interpretation
of this Agreement.

 



 

(g) All monetary figures shall be in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified.
Any accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined herein shall have
the meanings given to them under GAAP.

 



 

(h) The inclusion of specific examples or clarifications in certain
provisions, including those for the avoidance of doubt, shall not mean or be
used to interpret the lack of such examples or clarifications as evidence of
doubt, inapplicability of such examples or ambiguity in other provisions that
do not include such specific examples or clarifications.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Severability_. Without limiting the provisions of _Section
6.13(b)_, any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or
provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of
this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

Section 11.7 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with its
specific terms and that any remedy at law for any breach of any provision of
this Agreement would be inadequate. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that each Party shall be entitled to, in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement, an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and/or to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court specified in
_Section 11.11_, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity, and the Parties hereby agree not to assert, and hereby
waive, in any action seeking any such relief, the defense of adequacy of a
remedy at law and any requirement for the posting of any bond or other
security in connection therewith.

 



 

(b) Each Party further agrees that ( _i_ ) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this _Section 11.7_, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right
to seek any other form of relief that

 



      

 

 



 

may be available to such Party under this Agreement or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 11.7_ are not available or otherwise
are not granted, and ( _ii_ ) nothing set forth in this _Section 11.7_ shall
require any Party to institute any action for (or limit any Partys right to
institute any action for) specific performance under this _Section 11.7_
prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article
8_, nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this _Section 11.7_
or anything set forth in this _Section 11.7_ restrict or limit any such
Partys right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article 8_ or
pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or
thereafter. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, ( _A_ ) while
Seller is entitled to contemporaneously seek both specific performance and the
payment of monetary damages (including in connection with the provisions of
_Section 8.2_) as alternative remedies for a willful breach of this Agreement
by Buyer, under no circumstances shall Seller be entitled to receive both (
_1_ ) a grant of specific performance of the consummation of the Transactions
pursuant to this _Section 11.7_ and ( _2_ ) the payment of monetary damages
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ with respect to Buyers failure to close the
Transactions when required pursuant to _Section 2.2_, and ( _B_ ) in no event
shall any Party be permitted to seek specific performance or any other
injunctive relief or equitable remedy in respect of this Agreement following
the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 8_, other than
with respect to any obligations surviving such valid termination pursuant to
the terms hereof.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Binding Effect; Persons Benefiting; No Assignment_. This
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns and any transferee of all or
substantially all of the assets of such Party and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole. Except for _Section 6.7_, _Section 6.8_, _Section 11.9_, _Section
11.13_ and _Article 10_ (each of which shall be for the benefit of the
Persons set forth therein, and each such Person shall be an intended third-
party beneficiary thereof and shall have the rights, benefits and remedies
provided for therein), and _Section 11.1_, _Section 11.7_, _Section 11.11_,
_Section 11.12_ and _Section 11.16_ and this _Section 11.8_ (each of which
shall be for the benefit of the Financing Sources, and each Financing Source
shall be an intended third-party beneficiary thereof and shall be entitled to
rely on and enforce the terms thereof), no provision of this Agreement is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon any entity or Person other than
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns any right,
remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement or any part hereof. This
Agreement may not be assigned without the prior written consent of Buyer, in
the case of any assignment by Seller, or Seller, in the case of any assignment
by Buyer; _provided_ that ( _a_ ) on or after the Closing, this Agreement may
be collaterally assigned to the Financing Sources and ( _b)_ Buyer may assign
or delegate its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to any one of
its Affiliates without the consent of any other Party (except that such
assignment or delegation shall not relieve Buyer of its obligations
hereunder).

 



 

Section 11.9 _Absence of Liability of Non-Contracting Parties_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no past, present or future director,
officer, employee, Affiliate, controlling Person, direct or indirect equity
holder or member, agent or representative of Seller, Seller Parent or any
Acquired Company, other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Seller and, for
certain limited purposes, Seller Parent (collectively, " _Non-Contracting
Seller Parties_ "), shall have any liability, directly or indirectly, to Buyer
or any other Person, and Buyer (on behalf of itself and each other Buyer
Indemnitee) hereby ( _a_ ) irrevocably and

 



     

 

 



 

unconditionally releases all Non-Contracting Seller Parties and waives and
forever discharges any and all Claims related thereto or involving liability
(including personal liability) of any such Non-Contracting Seller Party, as a
result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation of Seller in this Agreement or otherwise under or in connection
with the provisions of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, ( _b_ )
agrees that Buyer and each other Buyer Indemnitee shall look solely to
Sellers assets for the payment of any Claim or for any performance and shall
have no right of recovery hereunder against, and no liability (including
personal liability) shall attach to any, Non-Contracting Seller Parties, and (
_c_ ) acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement
may only be enforced against, and any Claims that may be based upon, arise out
of or relate to this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement, may
only be made against the Parties or parties thereto, as applicable, and no
Non-Contracting Seller Party shall have any obligation hereunder or thereunder
or in connection herewith or therewith. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, no past, present or future director, officer, employee, Affiliate,
controlling Person, direct or indirect equity holder or member, agent or
representative of Buyer (collectively, " _Non-Contracting Buyer Parties_ ")
shall have any liability (including personal liability), directly or
indirectly, to Seller or any other Person, and Seller (on behalf of itself and
each other Seller Indemnitee) hereby ( _i_ ) irrevocably and unconditionally
releases all Non-Contracting Buyer Parties and waives and forever discharges
any and all Claims related thereto or involving liability (including personal
liability) of any such Non-Contracting Buyer Party, as a result of any breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of Buyer in
this Agreement or otherwise under or in connection with the provisions of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, ( _ii_ ) agrees that Seller and each
other Seller Indemnitee shall look solely to Buyers assets for the payment of
any Claim or for any performance and shall have no right of recovery hereunder
against, and no liability (including personal liability) shall attach to any,
Non-Contracting Buyer Parties, and ( _iii_ ) acknowledges and agrees that this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement may only be enforced against, and any
claims that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or
such Ancillary Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement or such Ancillary Agreement, may only be made against the Parties or
parties thereto, as applicable, and no Non-Contracting Buyer Party shall have
any obligation hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith.

 



 

Section 11.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement, it being
understood that all of the Parties need not sign the same counterpart.
Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by electronic image
scan transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.11 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including as to
validity, interpretation and effect, by the Laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws, to the
extent such principles or rules are not mandatorily

 



     

 

 



 

applicable by statute and would permit or require the application of the Laws
of another jurisdiction.

 



 

(b) Each of the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, in
any suit, claim, demand, action, proceeding or cause of action arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, agrees that all claims under any theory of
liability in respect of such suit, claim, demand, action, proceeding or cause
of action may and shall be heard and determined in any such court and agrees
not to bring any suit, claim, demand, action, proceeding or cause of action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court. Each Party
irrevocably and unconditionally waives any defense of inconvenient forum or
any other objection to the maintenance of any suit, claim, demand, action,
proceeding or cause of action so brought and waives any bond, surety or other
security that might be required of any other Party with respect thereto. Each
Party agrees that service of summons and complaint or any other process that
might be served in any suit, claim, demand, action, proceeding or cause of
action may be made on such Party, and shall be effective service of process
for any such suit, claim, demand, action, proceeding or cause of action, by
sending or delivering a copy of any such process to the Party to be served at
the address of the Party and in the manner provided for the giving of notices
in _Section 11.6_. Nothing in this _Section 11.11_, however, shall affect
the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by
Law. Each Party agrees that a final, non-appealable judgment in any suit,
claim, demand, action, proceeding or cause of action so brought shall be
conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by Law.

 



 

Section 11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any right to trial by jury of any suit, claim,
demand, action, proceeding or cause of action ( _i_ ) arising under this
Agreement or ( _ii_ ) in any way connected with or related or incidental to
the dealings of the Parties in respect of this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, in each case whether now existing or hereafter arising, and
whether in contract, tort, equity, or otherwise. Each of the Parties hereby
agrees and consents that any such suit, claim, demand, action, proceeding or
cause of action shall be decided by court trial without a jury and that the
Parties to this Agreement may file an original counterpart of a copy of this
Agreement with any court as written evidence of the consent of the Parties to
the waiver of their right to trial by jury.

 



 

Section 11.13 _Waiver of Conflicts_.

 



 

(a) Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including, after the
Closing, the Acquired Companies) covenants and agrees that, following the
Closing, Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP and any other internal or external
legal counsel (other than any internal counsel who is a Continuing Employee or
Vendor Employee) currently representing Seller and its Affiliates (each, a "
_Prior Company Counsel_ ") may serve as counsel to Seller and its Affiliates
in connection with any matters arising under or related to this Agreement or
the Transactions, including with respect to any litigation, claim or
obligation arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Transactions,
notwithstanding any representation by the Prior Company Counsel prior to the
Closing Date of Seller and its Affiliates (including the Acquired Companies).
Buyer (on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, including, after the Closing,
the Acquired Companies) hereby irrevocably ( _i_ ) waives any claim it has or
may have that a Prior Company Counsel has a conflict of interest or

 



     

 

 



 

is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation and ( _ii_ )
covenants and agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing between Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any Acquired Company, on the
one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, Prior
Company Counsel may represent Seller or any of its Affiliates in such dispute
even though the interests of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to Buyer,
any of its Affiliates or any Acquired Company and even though Prior Company
Counsel may have represented the Acquired Companies in a matter substantially
related to such dispute.

 



 

(b) All communications between direct and indirect holders of Shares (but in
the case of indirect holders, solely in their capacity as indirect holders of
Shares and not in any other capacity (including any other capacity as a
manager, director, officer or employee of an Acquired Company)), any Acquired
Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Prior Company Counsel, on the
other hand, related to the Transactions that occurred prior to the Closing
shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to such
direct and indirect holders of Shares and their respective Affiliates
(excluding the Acquired Companies) (the " _Seller Pre-Closing Communications_
"). Accordingly, Buyer, its Affiliates and the Acquired Companies shall not
have access to any such Seller Pre-Closing Communications or to the files of
Prior Company Counsel relating to the Transactions from and after the Closing,
and all books, records and other materials of the Acquired Companies in any
medium (including electronic copies) containing or reflecting any of the
Seller Pre-Closing Communications or the work product of legal counsel with
respect thereto, including any related summaries, drafts or analyses, and all
rights with respect to any of the foregoing, are hereby assigned and
transferred to Seller effective as of the Closing (collectively, the " _Seller
Privileged Materials_ "). The Seller Privileged Materials shall be excluded
from the transfer contemplated by this Agreement and shall be distributed to
Seller immediately prior to the Closing with no copies thereof retained by any
Acquired Company, Buyer or its Affiliates or their respective representatives,
except to the extent required by Applicable Law, bona fide document or
information retention policies or to the extent electronically archived
pursuant to bona fide information backup processes. To the extent that any
Seller Privileged Materials are not delivered to Seller, Buyer (on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates, including the Acquired Companies) agrees not to
assert a waiver of any applicable privilege or protection, and will deliver
all such Seller Privileged Materials to Seller promptly upon discovery
thereof, without retaining copies thereof except to the extent expressly
permitted to be retained in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence. From and after the Closing, Buyer, its Affiliates and the Acquired
Companies and their respective representatives shall maintain the
confidentiality of the Seller Privileged Materials to the extent received
thereby. From and after the Closing, none of Buyer, its Affiliates, the
Acquired Companies, and their respective representatives shall access or in
any way, directly or indirectly, use or rely upon any Seller Privileged
Materials. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from and after
the Closing, ( _i_ ) the direct and indirect holders of Shares (but in the
case of indirect holders, solely in their capacity as indirect holders of
Shares and not in any other capacity (including any other capacity as a
manager, director, officer or employee of any Acquired Company)) and their
respective Affiliates (excluding the Acquired Companies) shall be the sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the Seller Privileged
Materials, and none of the Acquired Companies shall be a holder thereof, (
_ii_ ) to the extent that files of Prior Company Counsel in respect of Seller
Privileged Materials constitute property of the client, only the direct and
indirect holders of Shares and their respective Affiliates (excluding the
Acquired Companies) shall hold such property rights and ( _iii_ ) Prior
Company Counsel shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any Seller
Privileged Materials to any Acquired Company by reason of any

 



     

 

 



 

attorney-client relationship between Prior Company Counsel and any Acquired
Company, or otherwise. For avoidance of doubt, all communications between
direct and indirect holders of Shares (but in the case of indirect holders,
solely in their capacity as indirect holders of Shares and not in any other
capacity (including any other capacity as a manager, director, officer or
employee of any Acquired Company)), the Acquired Companies and their
respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and Prior Company Counsel, on the
other hand, that are not related to Transactions shall be transferred to the
applicable Acquired Company at the time of the Closing. For further avoidance
of doubt, nothing in the foregoing shall prevent Buyer from complying with any
court order, subpoena or any type of compulsory process. Buyer hereby
acknowledges and confirms that it has had the opportunity to review and obtain
adequate information regarding the significance and risks of the waivers and
other terms and conditions of this _Section 11.13_, including the opportunity
to discuss with counsel such matters and reasonable alternatives to such
terms. The covenants and obligations set forth in this _Section 11.13_ shall
survive for seven (7) years following the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the Acquired
Companies or any of their Affiliates and a third party (other than a Party or
any of their respective Affiliates) after the Closing, Buyer, the Acquired
Companies and their Affiliates may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of the Seller Privileged Materials without the prior
written consent of any other Person.

 



 

(c) The provisions of this _Section 11.13_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, Seller, each direct and indirect holder of
Shares in their capacity as such and each Prior Company Counsel, who are
express third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 11.13_.

 



 

Section 11.14 _Exhibits and Schedules_. The Seller Disclosure Schedule, and
all exhibits, schedules, annexes or other documents expressly incorporated
into this Agreement, are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are
hereby made a part hereof as if set out in full in this Agreement. The mere
inclusion of any item in any section or subsection of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule as an exception to any representation or warranty or otherwise shall
not be deemed to constitute an admission or suggestion by the applicable
Party, or to otherwise imply, that any such item is or would reasonably be
expected to be material or has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect or a Material Adverse Effect, is required to be
disclosed, or otherwise represents a violation of, breach of or default under
any Contract or Law or otherwise or an exception or material fact, event or
circumstance for the purposes of this Agreement, or that such item meets or
exceeds a monetary or other threshold specified for disclosure in this
Agreement or otherwise. Such disclosure shall not be used as a basis for
interpreting the term "material," "materially," "materiality," "Seller
Material Adverse Effect," "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar
qualification. Unless the context would otherwise require, the term "material"
and the concept of the "material nature" of an effect upon any Acquired
Company shall be measured relative to the Acquired Companies, taken as a whole
as their Business is currently being conducted. The disclosures and other
information set forth in the Seller Disclosure Schedule relate to any and all
of the representations and warranties and covenants made in the Agreement and
to matters of disclosure generally (in each case, to the extent reasonably
apparent on its face). Matters disclosed in any section or subsection of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters that are
required by this Agreement to be disclosed therein, and such additional
matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not necessarily
include other matters of a similar nature

 



     

 

 



 

or impose any duty or obligation to disclose any information beyond what is
required by this Agreement, and disclosure of such additional matters shall
not affect, directly or indirectly, the interpretation of this Agreement or
the scope of the disclosure obligations hereunder. Headings inserted in the
sections or subsections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule are for convenience
of reference only and shall not have the effect of amending or changing the
express terms of the sections or subsections as set forth in this Agreement.
The Seller Disclosure Schedule and the information and statements contained
therein are not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed as
constituting, ( _x_ ) representations or warranties of Seller, except as, and
to the extent, provided in this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
or ( _y_ ) any covenant or agreement of Seller or any of its Affiliates to
take or omit to take any action or otherwise, except as, and to the extent,
provided in this Agreement or the Seller Disclosure Schedule. In no event
shall the inclusion of any matter in the Seller Disclosure Schedule be deemed
or interpreted to broaden the representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements of Seller and/or Seller Parent contained in this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, any Contract set forth on the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall not
be deemed to include any amendments, modifications or supplements thereto
unless and to the extent any such amendment, modification or supplement is
specifically listed on the Seller Disclosure Schedule and a copy thereof has
been provided to Buyer at least one (1) Business Day prior to the date hereof.

 



 

Section 11.15 _Seller Parent Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Seller Parent Guarantee_. Seller Parent hereby absolutely, irrevocably
and unconditionally guarantees to Buyer, on the terms and conditions set forth
in this _Section 11.15(a)_, the full and punctual payment by Seller when due
of any obligation of Seller to pay any amount or amounts due to Buyer Tax
Indemnified Parties or Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ and
_Article 10_, as applicable, to the extent the same is required to be paid by
Seller pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations
thereof (the " _Obligations_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, Buyer acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and each
Buyer Tax Indemnified Party and Buyer Indemnitee that ( _i_ ) to the extent
Seller is relieved of any of the Obligations for any reason (including
pursuant to any limitation ( _x_ ) arising out of the terms and conditions of
_Section 10.1_ or _Section 10.4_ or ( _y_ ) based upon the Per Claim
Threshold, the Indemnification Deductible or the Indemnity Cap) Seller Parent
shall be similarly relieved of such Obligations for all purposes hereunder,
and ( _ii_ ) Seller Parent may assert, as a defense to, or release or
discharge of, any payment or performance by Seller Parent hereunder, any
claim, set-off, deduction, defense or release that Seller could assert against
Buyer, any Buyer Tax Indemnified Party or any Buyer Indemnitee, in each case,
under the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Seller Parent Representations and Warranties_.

 



 

(i) Seller Parent hereby represents and warrants that: ( _A_ ) Seller Parent
is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware, and Seller Parent has the requisite organizational power
and authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and to
own, lease and operate all of its properties and assets; ( _B_ ) Seller Parent
has all requisite power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations

 



     

 

 



 

under this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or will be, a
party; ( _C_ ) the execution, delivery and performance by Seller Parent of
this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or will be, a
party, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary action, and do
not contravene any provision of the Organizational Documents of Seller Parent
or any Applicable Law, order, judgment or material Contract binding on Seller
Parent or its material assets and no other proceedings after the date hereof
on the part of Seller Parent are necessary to authorize the execution,
delivery and performance by Seller Parent of this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement to which it is, or will be, a party, and would not result in the
creation or imposition of any Encumbrance on any asset of Seller Parent (other
than Permitted Encumbrances); ( _D_ ) all consents, approvals, authorizations,
permits of, filings with and notifications to, any Governmental Authority
necessary for the due execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and any Ancillary Agreement to which Seller Parent is, or will be, a party, by
Seller Parent have been obtained or made and all conditions thereof have been
duly complied with, and no other action by, and no notice to or filing with,
any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution,
delivery or performance by Seller Parent of this Agreement or any such
Ancillary Agreement; and ( _E_ ) each of this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreement to which Seller Parent is, or will be, a party, has been duly
executed and delivered by Seller Parent and constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of Seller Parent enforceable against Seller Parent in
accordance with its terms, except ( _1_ ) to the extent that enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors rights generally and ( _2_ ) that the availability of equitable
remedies, including specific performance, is subject to the discretion of the
