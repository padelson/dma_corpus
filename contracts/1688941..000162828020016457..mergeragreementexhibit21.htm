place at 9:00 a.m. Central time on the second Business Day following the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their

to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of those conditions), at the
offices of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 2001 Ross Avenue, Suite 2100, Dallas,
Texas 75201, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by
Parent and the Company; provided, that notwithstanding the satisfaction or, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be

provided, further, that the Closing may occur remotely via electronic exchange
of required Closing documentation in lieu of an in-person Closing, and the

as practicable on or after the Closing Date, shall make any and all other
filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the
Delaware Secretary of State or at such other date or time as Parent and the
Company shall agree in writing and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger
(the time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time"). Section 1.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of

debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 1.5 Certificate of Incorporation; Bylaws.

shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth in Exhibit
C hereto, and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the
Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and
restated to read in their entirety as set forth in Exhibit D hereto, and, as
so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with their terms, the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and applicable Law.

Section 1.6 Directors. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation upon the
Effective Time to serve until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.

the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2) (the " FIRPTA
Certificate") along with written authorization for Parent to deliver the
FIRPTA Certificate to the IRS on behalf of the Company upon the Closing of the
Merger. The Company's obligation to deliver the FIRPTA Certificate shall not
be considered a condition precedent to the Closing of the Merger.

ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS;
EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or
Merger Sub:



(a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Company (a
"Share") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other
than (i) Shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.1(b) and (ii) any
Dissenting Shares), shall thereupon be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive $19.25 in cash, without interest, and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Tax (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective
Time, all Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist and shall thereafter only represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with Section 2.3, without
interest.



(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, Merger Sub or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time (in each case, other than any
such Shares held on behalf of third parties) shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.



(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.



(d) If at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company, or securities convertible into or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock
split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or
any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such
period, or any merger, consolidation or other event or similar transaction,
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted, to reflect such event so
as to provide Parent and the holders of Shares the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; provided, that nothing in
this Section 2.1(d) shall be construed to permit the Company to take any
action with respect to its securities that is prohibited by the terms of this
Agreement.

Section 2.2 Treatment of Company Equity Awards.



(a) At the Effective Time, each grant of restricted stock units (each, a
"Company RSU Award") granted under the Foundation Building Materials, Inc.
2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the "Company Stock Plan") that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest and be converted into
the right to receive an amount in cash (without interest and subject to
applicable Tax withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the Merger
Consideration multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Company
RSU Award. Following the Effective Time, no Company RSU Award that was
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding,
and each former holder of any Company RSU Award shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth
in this Section 2.2(a) in exchange for such Company RSU Award in accordance
with this Section 2.2(a). (b) At the Effective Time, each option to purchase Shares (each, a "Company
Option" and together with the Company RSU Awards, the "Company Equity Awards")
granted under the Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall fully vest and be converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash (without interest and subject to applicable Tax
withholdings) equal to the product of (i) the remainder, if positive of (A)
the Merger Consideration minus (B) the exercise price per Share of such
Company Option multiplied by (ii) the number of Shares subject to such Company
Option. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the exercise price per
Share of a Company Option exceeds or equals the Merger Consideration, such
Company Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time for no consideration.
Following the Effective Time, no Company Option that was outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding, and each
former holder of any Company Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration set forth in
this Section 2.2(b) in exchange for such Company Option in accordance with
this Section 2.2(b).



(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or a duly authorized
committee thereof shall adopt such resolutions as may be reasonably required
to (i) effectuate the provisions of this Section 2.2 and (ii) terminate the
Company Stock Plan and all outstanding awards thereunder subject to receipt of
the consideration set forth in this Section 2.2. The Surviving Corporation
shall pay through its payroll the amounts due in accordance with this Section
2.2 no later than the later of (i) the next scheduled payroll payment date
following the Effective Time and (ii) three Business Days following the
Effective Time.

Section 2.3 Exchange and Payment.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall enter into an agreement (in
a form reasonably acceptable to the Company) with the Company's transfer agent
to act as agent for the stockholders of the Company in connection with the
Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive the Merger Consideration to which
stockholders of the Company shall become entitled pursuant to this Article II.
At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be
deposited) with the Paying Agent cash in an amount sufficient to make all
payments pursuant to Section 2.1 (such cash being hereinafter referred to as
the "Payment Fund"). The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments due pursuant to this Article II, except as provided in
this Agreement. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges and expenses,
including those of the Paying Agent, incurred by it in connection with the
exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration and other amounts contemplated
by this Article II.



(b) Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than the
second Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares that were outstanding
and represented by a certificate or outstanding certificates ("Certificates")
immediately prior to the Effective Time and were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto pursuant to Section
2.1(a), (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates held by such
Person shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying
Agent, and which letter shall be in customary form of the Paying Agent as agreed to by Parent and shall include a customary waiver of rights as a
former equityholder of the Company) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration
payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.1(a). Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably require,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share formerly represented by such
Certificate (without interest and subject to deduction for any required
withholding Tax), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Promptly after the Effective Time and in any event not later than
the second Business Day following the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall
issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated Shares that were
outstanding and represented by book entry immediately prior to the Effective
Time ("Book-Entry Shares") a check or wire transfer for the amount of cash
that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in respect
of such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and such
Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued
for the benefit of holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger
Consideration payable in respect of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.



(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person (as
defined below) other than the Person in whose name any Share represented by
any surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share is registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such Book-Entry
Share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Share represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share
surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such
Tax either has been paid or is not applicable.



(d) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.3, each Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of Shares theretofore represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares, as applicable, pursuant to Section 2.1(a), without any interest
thereon.



(e) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to
establish procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company
("DTC") to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m.
(New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominees on the Closing Date an amount in cash in immediately available
funds equal to the number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Merger Consideration
(such amount, the "DTC Payment"), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30
a.m. (New York time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to
DTC or its nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount
in cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment. (f) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with
respect to the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II, subject to applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.



(g) The Paying Agent shall not invest any cash included in the Payment Fund
unless otherwise directed by Parent; provided, that any investment of such
cash shall in all events be in short-term obligations of the United States of
America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United
States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States
of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A 1 or P 1 or better by
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation,
respectively. If for any reason (including investment losses) the cash in the
Payment Fund is insufficient to satisfy fully all of the payment obligations
to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly
deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the
deficiency of cash required to satisfy fully such cash payment obligations.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be for the
sole benefit of the Surviving Corporation and shall be payable to the
Surviving Corporation.



(h) At any time following the date that is one year after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to
deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto)
which have been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not been
disbursed to former holders of Shares represented by Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent
and the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger
Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares.



(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
holder's compliance with the replacement requirements established by the
Paying Agent, including, if necessary, the posting by such Person of a bond in
customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or
the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

Section 2.4 Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Shares, Company
Equity Awards or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; provided, that Parent shall
consult with the Principal Stockholder in good faith prior to withholding any
amounts payable to any Company stockholder hereunder. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.5 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and does
not vote such Shares in favor of the Merger or consent thereto in writing
("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless and until such holder shall have failed to
perfect, or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost, such holder's right to
appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall be treated in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or withdraws
or loses any such right to appraisal, each such Share of such holder shall
thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable only for the right to
receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the time that such right to
appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or expired, the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(a). The Company shall serve
prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal
of any Shares, attempted withdrawals of such notices or demands and any other
instruments received by the Company relating to rights of appraisal (including
providing Parent with copies of all notices and demands) and Parent shall have
the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. The Company shall not, without the prior consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or compromise or settle, any such
demands or waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal
or otherwise comply with the provisions under Section 262 of the DGCL.

furnished after January 1, 2019 and at least two Business Days prior to the
date of this Agreement (but excluding any risk factor disclosures contained
under the heading "Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included in any
"forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that are
similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature, in each case, other than
any specific factual information contained therein), or (b) as set forth in
the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the
execution of this Agreement (the "Company Disclosure Letter") (it being agreed
that disclosure of any information in the Company Disclosure Letter with
respect to a particular section or subsection of this Agreement shall be
deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of this
Agreement to which the relevance of such information is reasonably apparent on
its face), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as Section 3.1 Organization, Standing and Power.



(a) The Company (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in

business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except in the case of clause (iii), for
any such failures to have such power and authority or to be so qualified or
licensed or in good standing as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect" means any event, change, occurrence or
effect that would have a material adverse effect on the business, financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, other than any event, change, occurrence or effect arising out of,
attributable to or resulting from, alone or in combination, (1) changes in
general economic or business conditions or in the financial, debt, banking,
capital, credit or securities markets, or in interest or exchange rates, in
each case, in the United States or elsewhere in the world; (2) general changes
or developments in any of the industries in which the Company or its
Subsidiaries operate; (3) actions required under this Agreement and approved
by Parent in accordance with Section 5.7 to obtain any approval or
authorization under applicable antitrust or competition Laws for the
consummation of the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby; (4)

any COVID-19 Measures) or (y) changes after the date of this Agreement in GAAP
or in applicable accounting regulations or principles or interpretations
thereof; (5) any change in the price or trading volume of the Company's stock,
in and of itself (provided, that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or
contributing to such change in price or trading volume that are not otherwise
excluded from the definition of "Material Adverse Effect" may be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Material Adverse Effect); (6)
any failure by the Company to meet internal or published projections,
forecasts or revenue or earnings predictions, in and of itself (provided, that
the facts or occurrences giving rise to or contributing to such failure that
are not otherwise excluded from the definition of "Material Adverse Effect"
may be taken into account in determining whether there has been a Material
Adverse Effect); (7) geopolitical conditions or any outbreak, continuation or
escalation of any military conflict, declared or undeclared war, armed
hostilities, or acts of foreign or domestic terrorism (including cyber-
terrorism); (8) natural or manmade disasters, hurricanes, floods, tornados,
tsunamis, earthquakes or other weather conditions or other acts of God; (9)
any epidemic, pandemic or disease outbreak (including COVID-19), or any Law
issued by a Governmental Entity, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the World Health Organization or industry group providing for
COVID-19 Measures, business closures, "sheltering-in-place," curfews or other
restrictions that relate to, or arise out of, an epidemic, pandemic or disease
outbreak (including COVID-19) or any change in such Law or interpretation
thereof following the date of this Agreement or any worsening of such
conditions threatened or existing as of the date of this Agreement; (10) any
national or international political or social conditions, including the
engagement in, or escalation, outbreak or worsening of, hostilities in or by
any country or the occurrence of any act of war or any similar act of
terrorism, civil unrest, protests, public demonstrations or the response of Governmental Entity thereto; (11) the announcement of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the initiation of litigation by
any stockholder of the Company with respect to this Agreement, and including
any termination of, reduction in or similar negative impact on relationships,
contractual or otherwise, with any customers, suppliers, distributors,
partners or employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries due to the
announcement and performance of this Agreement or the identity of the parties
to this Agreement, or the performance of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including compliance with the covenants set forth herein;
provided, that in no event shall this clause (11) impact the Company's
representations in Section 3.4; or (12) any actions taken (or omitted to be
taken) at the express written direction of Parent (except to the extent the
Company was prohibited from taking such action pursuant to Section 5.1 and
requested the consent of Parent to take such action); provided, in the case of
clauses (1), (2), (4), (7), (8) and (10), to the extent the impact of such
event, change, occurrence or effect is not disproportionately adverse to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, relative to other companies
operating in the industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate;
provided, further, that in such event, only the incremental disproportionate
impact shall be taken into account when determining whether there has been a
"Material Adverse Effect".

Parent a true and complete copy of the Company Charter and amended and
restated bylaws (the "Company Bylaws"), in each case as amended to the date of

business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except, with respect to clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii), for any such failures to be so organized, existing and in good
standing, to have such power and authority or to be so qualified or licensed
or in good standing as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.5 SEC Reports; Financial Statements.



(a) The Company has filed or otherwise transmitted all forms, reports,
statements, certifications and other documents (including all exhibits,
schedules, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed by it with
the SEC since January 1, 2019 (all such forms, reports, statements,
certificates and other documents filed or furnished or incorporated by
reference therein since January 1, 2019, collectively, the "Company SEC
Documents"). As of their respective dates, or, if amended, as of the date of
the last such amendment, each of the Company SEC Documents complied as to form
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and the Exchange Act, and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, as the case may be, in effect on the date so filed. As of their respective filing dates (or, if
amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of
the date of such amendment or superseding filing), none of the Company SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated or incorporated by reference
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date
hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters

and its Subsidiaries at the respective dates thereof and the results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated. The unaudited

financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective
dates thereof and the results of their operations and cash flows for the
periods indicated (subject to normal period-end adjustments).



(c) Since January 1, 2019, the Company has maintained disclosure controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in its filings with the SEC under the
Exchange Act is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of the Company's filings with the SEC under
the Exchange Act. Since January 1, 2019, the Company has maintained internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as
applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial
reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has disclosed,
based on the most recent evaluation of its Chief Executive Officer and its
Chief Financial Officer prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company's
auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (i) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of its
internal control over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (ii) all fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.



(d) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in the comment letters received from the SEC staff with respect to
the Company SEC Documents and, to the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC
Documents is subject to ongoing review or outstanding SEC comment or
investigation.

respects with the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and

Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise, known or unknown, or due or to become due,
that would be required by GAAP to be recorded or reflected on a consolidated
balance sheet (or the notes thereto) of the Company and its Subsidiaries,

Documents, (b) incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of
the Company Balance Sheet, (c) which have been discharged or paid in full
prior to the date of this Agreement, (d) incurred pursuant to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (e) that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

Section 3.7 Certain Information. None of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the Company for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Information Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders
of the Company contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Information Statement will comply as to form and substance
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Company makes no representation or warranty with respect to any
information supplied by Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Information Statement.

businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been conducted in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice in all material
respects and (b) there has not been any event, change, occurrence or effect
that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect and (c) the Company has not taken any action that
would have required the prior written consent of Parent under Section
5.1(b)(i), (iii), (iv), (v), (viii), (ix), (x), (xi), (xii) or (xiii) if such
action had been taken after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Closing.

 Section 3.9 Litigation. As of the date hereof, (a) there is no suit, claim,
action, proceeding, arbitration, mediation or investigation (each, an
"Action") pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the

Agreement.

Section 3.10 Compliance with Laws. Except with respect to ERISA,
Environmental Matters and Taxes (which are the subject of Sections 3.11, 3.13
and 3.14, respectively), the Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with all Laws applicable to them or by which any of their
respective properties are bound, except where any non-compliance would not,
individually or the aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. None of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has received, since January 1, 2019, a written notice or
other written communication alleging or relating to a possible violation of
any Law applicable to their businesses, operations, properties or assets,
except for any such violations that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except with respect to Environmental Laws
(which are the subject of Section 3.13), the Company and its Subsidiaries have
in effect all permits, licenses, exemptions, authorizations, franchises,
orders and approvals of all Governmental Entities (collectively, "Permits")
necessary for them to own, lease or operate their properties and to carry on
their businesses as now conducted, except for any Permits the absence of which
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. All Permits are in full force and effect, except
where the failure to be in full force and effect would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.11 Benefit Plans.



(a) The Company has provided to Parent a true and complete list of each
material "employee benefit plan" (within the meaning of section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")),

sponsored by the Company or its Subsidiaries or under which any employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries has any present or future right to benefits,
or under which the Company or its Subsidiaries have any present or future
liability (all such plans, agreements, programs, policies and arrangements

any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which Parent or
Merger Sub or any of their respective properties are bound, except, in the

Section 4.7 Reserved. 



Section 4.8 Financing.



(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, correct and complete copy of
a duly executed equity commitment letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, between the Parent and the Sponsor (such letter, the "Equity
Commitment Letter") pursuant to which the Sponsor has committed, subject to
the terms and conditions thereof, to invest in Parent, directly or indirectly,
cash amounts (the "Financing") to pay (i) the Merger Consideration payable at
Closing pursuant to Section 2.3, and all other amounts payable pursuant to
Article II, (ii) for repayment, prepayment or discharge (after giving effect
to the Merger) of the principal of, and interest on, outstanding indebtedness
for borrowed money of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (iii) all fees and
expenses required to be paid in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including any indemnification or reimbursement obligations pursuant to
Section 5.15(e) and Section 5.15(f), and (iv) the Termination Payment
(collectively, the "Required Funds").



(b) As of the date of this Agreement, (i) the Equity Commitment Letter and
the terms of the Financing have not been amended or modified, (ii) no such
amendment or modification is contemplated, (iii) the respective commitments
contained in the Equity Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, terminated
or rescinded in any respect and (iv) there are no other Contracts, agreements,
side letters or arrangements to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates is a party relating to the funding or investing, as
applicable, of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set
forth in the Equity Commitment Letter.



(c) Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter, the Financing is sufficient to pay
the Required Funds.



(d) The Equity Commitment Letter (in the forms delivered by Parent to the
Company) has been duly executed and delivered by Parent, Merger Sub and the
Sponsor, as applicable, and, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by the other parties signatory thereto, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of Parent, Merger Sub and the Sponsor, as applicable,
enforceable against such party in accordance with its terms (except to the
extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors' rights generally or by general principles of
equity). Other than as expressly set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter,
there are no conditions precedent or other contingencies (express or implied)
related to the funding of the full proceeds of the Financing pursuant to any
agreement relating to the Financing to which any of the Sponsor, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates is a party. No party to the
Equity Commitment Letter is in violation or breach of any of the terms or
conditions set forth therein, and as of the date of this Agreement, no event
has occurred that, with or without notice or lapse of time or both, would, or
would reasonably be expected to, (A) constitute a default, breach or failure
to satisfy a condition precedent set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, or
(B) result in any portion of the Financing being unavailable on the Closing
Date, assuming the conditions to the Financing are satisfied. As of the date Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that (i) it will be unable to
satisfy on a timely basis any term or condition to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing to be satisfied by it or (ii) the full amount of the
Financing will not be available on the Closing Date. No party to Equity
Commitment Letter has notified Parent of its intention to terminate any of the
commitments set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter or not to provide the
Financing and as of the date of this Agreement and no termination of any
commitment set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter is contemplated by
Parent. Parent and Merger Sub have fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, all
commitment or other fees that are due and payable on or prior to the date of
this Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter.

Section 4.9 Vote/Approval Required. No vote or consent of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Parent is necessary to approve this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. The vote or consent of
Parent as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub (which was delivered in
connection with the execution of this Agreement) is the only vote or consent
of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Merger Sub necessary
to approve this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 4.10 Ownership of Shares. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of
Parent's Affiliates owns (directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record)
any Shares or holds any rights to acquire or vote any Shares except pursuant
to this Agreement.

Section 4.11 Brokers. Neither Parent, Merger Sub or their Affiliates has
employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage

expenses shall be paid by Parent.

Section 4.12 No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly contained in Article III hereof, each
of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees (on its own behalf and on
behalf of each of their respective Related Parties) that neither the Company
nor any other Person on behalf of the Company or otherwise has made, and that
none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Related Parties has
relied upon, any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of their respective
businesses or any other matter in connection with their entry into this
Agreement, agreement to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise. None of the Company, any of the
Company's Related Parties or any other Person will have or be subject to any
liability to Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Related Parties or
any other Person resulting from the distribution to Parent, Merger Sub, any of
their respective Related Parties or any other Person, or any of the
foregoing's use of, any such information, including any information,
documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available to any of
the foregoing or any other Person in certain "data rooms" or management
presentations in expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement, the
Merger, the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise. Section 4.13 Access to Information. Each of Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledges and agrees that it (a) has had an opportunity to discuss and ask
questions regarding the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the
management of the Company, (b) has had access to the books and records of the
Company, the "data room" maintained by the Company for purposes of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such other

own independent investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, and has not relied on any
representation or warranty by any Person regarding the Company and its
Subsidiaries or otherwise, except as expressly set forth in Article III.
Without limiting the foregoing, except for the representations and warranties
set forth in Article III of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub
further acknowledges and agrees that none of the Company or any of its
stockholders, directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or
other Representatives has made any representation or warranty concerning any
estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans or other forward-looking
information regarding the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
businesses and operations. Each of Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledges
that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to develop such estimates,
projections, forecasts, business plans and other forward-looking information
with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger Sub are
taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy and
accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts, business plans and other
forward-looking information furnished to them (including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts, business
plans and other forward-looking information), and that none of Parent, Merger
Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any Representative of any of the
foregoing will have any claim against the Company or any of its stockholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents or other
Representatives with respect thereto.

Section 5.4 Acquisition Proposals.



(a) Except as set forth in this Section 5.4, the Company agrees that neither
it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct its and their
respective officers, directors, agents and representatives (including any
investment banker, attorney, accountant or other advisor retained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries collectively, "Representatives") not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage
(including by providing information) any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to, or the making or completion of, an Acquisition Proposal, or (ii)
engage or participate in any negotiations or discussions (other than to refer
the inquiring Person to this Section 5.4 or contacting any Person making an
Acquisition Proposal to ascertain facts or clarify terms for the purpose of
the Company Board (or the Special Committee) reasonably informing itself as to
such Acquisition Proposal) concerning, or provide or cause to be provided any
non-public information or data relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with, an Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly,
and in any event no later than one Business Day following the date of this
Agreement, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished in the last six months for the purpose of
evaluating an Acquisition Proposal and shall terminate all dataroom access
previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives. The Company
agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; provided, that nothing in this
Agreement shall restrict a Person from requesting on a confidential basis from
the Company the waiver of a "standstill" or similar obligation or from the
Company granting such a waiver to the extent necessary to comply with
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.4(a), at any time
prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company may, in
response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that did not
result from a breach of Section 5.4(a) and that the Company Board (acting upon
the recommendation of the Special Committee) determines in good faith
constitutes or may reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, (i)
furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes
specifically necessary in order for the Company to be able to comply with its
obligations under this Agreement and it being understood that the Company may
not enter into a confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision at
least as restrictive as the standstill provisions in the Confidentiality
Agreement) and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations with such
Person and its Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that the Company shall promptly provide or make available to Parent
any material non-public information concerning the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal
or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to
Parent.



(c) Subject to the permitted actions contemplated by clauses (d) and (e)
below, and Section 7.1(c)(ii), neither the Company Board nor the Special
Committee shall (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse
to Parent or Merger Sub, or publicly propose to or resolve to withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the
Company Recommendation or approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable, any Acquisition Proposal or
make or authorize the making of any public statement (oral or written) that
has the substantive effect of such a withdrawal, qualification or modification
(any of such actions, an "Adverse Recommendation Change"; provided, that
delivery of a written notice to Parent as contemplated by paragraph (d) below,
or public disclosure that such notice has been delivered to Parent, shall not
be deemed to constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change or otherwise a
violation of this clause (i)), or (ii) cause or permit the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger
agreement, or other similar agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in Section 5.4(b) entered into in compliance with Section 5.4(b))
(an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") relating to any Acquisition Proposal.



(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.4,
following receipt of a written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
breach of this Section 5.4, and that the Company Board (acting upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee) determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors,
constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board and the Special Committee
may at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, but
not after, make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(ii), or authorize,
resolve, agree or propose publicly to take any such action, if all of the
following conditions are met:

(i) (A) the Company shall have provided to Parent four Business Days' prior
written notice, which shall state expressly (1) that it has received a written
Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, (2) the material
terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal (including the consideration
offered therein and the identity of the Person or group making the Acquisition
Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided an unredacted copy of the
Alternative Acquisition Agreement and all other documents (other than immaterial documents) related to the Superior Proposal (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial terms or any other
material term or condition of such Superior Proposal shall require a new
notice and an additional three Business Day period) and (3) that, subject to
clause (ii) below, the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee) has determined to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(ii) in order to
enter into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement, as applicable, and (B) prior
to making such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in
accordance with Section 7.1(c)(ii), as applicable, (x) the Company shall have
used commercially reasonable efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to
the extent Parent wishes to engage) during such four Business Day period to
consider any adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement such that the Alternative Acquisition Agreement ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal and (y) in determining whether to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or to effect a termination in accordance with
Section 7.1(c)(ii), the Company Board and the Special Committee shall have
taken into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent and any other information provided by Parent in response to such
notice; and

(ii) the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) shall have determined, in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior
Proposal and taking into account any revised terms proposed by Parent, such
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that the
failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change or to so terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.1(c)(ii), as applicable, would be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 5.4, at
any time prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval,
upon the occurrence of any Intervening Event, the Company Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change if all of the following conditions are met:

(i) the Company shall have (A) provided to Parent four Business Days' prior
written notice, which shall (1) set forth in reasonable detail information
describing the Intervening Event and the rationale for the Adverse
Recommendation Change and (2) state expressly that, subject to clause (ii)
below, the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) has determined to make an Adverse Recommendation Change and (B)
prior to making such an Adverse Recommendation Change, used commercially
reasonable efforts to engage in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent
wishes to engage) during such four Business Day period to consider any
adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to
the Intervening Event in accordance with clause (ii) below would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; and

(ii) the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special
Committee) shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that in light of such Intervening Event and taking into
account any revised terms proposed by Parent, the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would
be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties under applicable
Law.

(f) The Company as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours)
shall advise Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) any request for non-public information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries, other than requests for information not reasonably expected to
be related to an Acquisition Proposal and (iii) any inquiry or request for
discussion or negotiation regarding an Acquisition Proposal, including in each
case the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry
or request and the material terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request and thereafter shall keep Parent informed on a current basis, of the
status and terms of any such proposals or offers and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

(g) Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall prevent the Company, the Company
Board or the Special Committee from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e 2(a), Rule 14d 9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to stockholders in connection with the making or amendment of a
tender offer or exchange offer) or from (ii) making any required disclosure to
the Company's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board
or the Special Committee, after consultation with their respective outside
counsel, failure to disclose such information would reasonably be expected to
violate their respective obligations or fiduciary or other duties under
applicable Law; provided, that nothing in Section 5.4(g)(i) shall affect,
waive or modify the Company's obligations with respect to Section 5.4(a)
through Section 5.4(f), including its obligations regarding an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

(h) As used in this Agreement:

consolidation, share purchase, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, partnership, spin-
off, extraordinary dividend or similar transaction involving the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, which is structured to permit such Person or group of
Persons to, directly or indirectly, acquire beneficial ownership of 20% or
more of the outstanding equity securities of the Company, or 20% or more of
the consolidated net revenues, net income or total assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) the acquisition in any manner,
directly or indirectly, of over 20% of the equity securities or consolidated
total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case other than the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) "Intervening Event" means a material event, circumstance, change or
development that was not known to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Company
Board prior to the execution of this Agreement (or if known or reasonably
foreseeable, the material consequences of which were not known or reasonably
foreseeable), which effect, or any material consequence thereof, becomes known
to, or reasonably foreseeable by, the Company Board prior to the receipt of the Stockholder Written Consent; provided, that an
"Intervening Event" shall exclude any event, circumstance, change or
development related to (A) any Acquisition Proposal or other inquiry, offer or
proposal that would reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal,
(B) consisting of or resulting from a breach of this Agreement by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or (C) any changes in the market price, or change
in trading volume, of the Shares (it being understood that the underlying
causes of any such changes or developments may, if they are not otherwise
excluded from the definition of "Intervening Event", be taken into account in
determining whether an Intervening Event has occurred).

(iii) "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal (A)
on terms which the Company Board (acting upon the recommendation of the
Special Committee) determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and financial advisors, to be more favorable from a

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all the terms
and conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and (B) that the Company
Board (acting upon the recommendation of the Special Committee) determines in
good faith is capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects of such proposal; provided, that for
purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the references to "20%" in
the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be deemed to be references to
"50%."

Section 5.5 Stockholder Written Consent; Information Statement.

(a) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement and in
lieu of calling a meeting of the Company's stockholders, the Company shall (i)
submit the Stockholder Written Consent, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
E (the "Stockholder Written Consent"), to the Principal Stockholder and (ii)
use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Stockholder Written Consent,
duly executed by the Principal Stockholder and duly delivered to the Company
in accordance with the DGCL, from the Principal Stockholder before 9:00 a.m.,
New York, New York time, on the day immediately following the date of this
Agreement (the "Stockholder Approval Deadline"), and deliver the Stockholder
Written Consent, so duly executed, to Parent. The Company shall comply with
applicable Law, the Company Charter and Company Bylaws in connection with
obtaining the Stockholder Written Consent, including giving notice of the
action so taken by pursuant to the Stockholder Written Consent in accordance
with Section 228(e) of the DGCL and notice of the availability of appraisal
rights in connection with the Merger in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL to the holders of Shares entitled thereto not executing the Stockholder
Written Consent, together with any additional information required by the
DGCL. The parties agree and acknowledge that the Stockholder Written Consent
shall be void and of no further effect if this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with the terms and conditions hereof.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval (but in any event, no more than 10 days following the
date hereof), the Company shall prepare, and the Company shall file with the
SEC, the preliminary Information Statement relating to the Merger. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub shall reasonably cooperate with the Company in the preparation of the preliminary Information Statement,
the definitive Information Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto
and shall promptly (and in any event within three days of the Company's
request therefor) furnish to the Company the information relating to Parent
and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act for inclusion therein. Prior to
filing with the SEC, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Information
Statement and shall consider in good faith for inclusion in the Information
Statement any comments made by Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel that are
provided in a timely manner. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to
the Information Statement and to cause the Information Statement in definitive
form to be mailed to the holders of Shares entitled thereto as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after
(1) the tenth calendar day after the initial filing of the preliminary
Information Statement with the SEC if by such date the SEC has not informed
the Company that it intends to review the Information Statement or (2) if the
SEC has, by the tenth calendar day after the filing of the initial preliminary
Information Statement with the SEC, informed the Company that it intends to
review the Information Statement, the date on which the SEC confirms that it
has no further comments on the Information Statement. The Company shall notify
Parent promptly of (and in any event no more than one Business Day after) the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any request by the
SEC or its staff for any amendments or supplements to the preliminary
Information Statement or the definitive Information Statement, and the Company
and Parent shall cooperate in filing with the SEC or its staff, and if
required, the Company shall mail to the holders of Shares entitled thereto, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, such amendment or supplement. Prior to
filing with the SEC, the Company shall provide Parent, Merger Sub and their
counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such amendments
or supplements to the Information Statement and shall reasonably consider in
good faith for inclusion in any amendments or supplements any comments made by
Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel that are provided in a timely manner. If
at any time prior to the Closing any event shall occur, or fact or information
shall be discovered, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Information Statement so that such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall as
promptly as practicable notify the other parties hereto and the Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC such amendment or supplement, in consultation
with and subject to review by Parent as promptly as practicable and, to the
extent required by Law, cause such amendment or supplement to be disseminated
to the holders of Shares entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof, the parties shall not be required, after the date of
termination, to prepare, file and mail the Information Statement pursuant to
this Section 5.5(b).

(c) Immediately following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent
shall duly execute and deliver, in accordance with the DGCL and the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, a written consent duly
adopting this Agreement in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub,
which written consent shall thereupon become effective in accordance with its
terms, the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub, and promptly following the effectiveness of such written
consent Parent shall provide a copy of such duly executed written consent to
the Company.

Section 5.6 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time or the earlier
termination of this Agreement, upon reasonable prior written notice, the
Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best effects to cause its
Subsidiaries, officers, directors and representative to, afford to Parent,
Merger Sub and their respective Representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours, consistent with applicable Law (including any
applicable COVID-19 Measures), so long as such access does not jeopardize the
health and safety of any employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, and
solely for the purpose of consummating the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated herein, to its officers, employees, properties, offices, other
facilities and books and records, and shall furnish Parent with all financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent shall reasonably request in
writing (it being agreed, however, that the foregoing shall not permit Parent
or its officers, employees or representatives to conduct any environmental
testing or sampling, including but not limited to facility surface and
subsurface soils and water, air or building materials and, provided, that
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to prepare,
produce, compile or furnish any such data or information that is not already
being prepared, produced or compiled by the Company or such Subsidiary, as the
case may be, in the ordinary course of business, and any such data or
information may be delivered in the form in which it is ordinarily
maintained). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such investigation or
consultation shall be conducted in such a manner as not to result in any
significant interference with the business or operations of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or otherwise result in any significant interference with the
prompt and timely discharge by the employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries of their normal duties. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information, books and records, or other data or materials where such access
or disclosure would (i) breach any agreement with any third-party, (ii)
constitute a waiver of or jeopardize the attorney-client or other privilege
held by the Company or any such Subsidiary or (iii) violate any applicable
Law.

(b) Each of Parent and Merger Sub will hold and treat and will cause its
Representatives to hold and treat in confidence all documents and information
concerning the Company, the Principal Stockholder and the Company's
Subsidiaries furnished to Parent and Merger Sub, in connection with the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement, dated August 4, 2020, between American
Securities LLC and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), which shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 5.7 Further Action; Efforts.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done (but subject to the other
provisions of this Section 5.7), and cooperate with each other in order to do,
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law (including under any Antitrust Law (as defined below)) to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the
earliest practicable date, including: (i) causing the preparation and filing
of all forms, registrations and notices required to be filed to consummate the
Merger and the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite
consent, non-action or expiration of any applicable waiting period under the
HSR Act, the Competition Act or any other Foreign Antitrust Law; (ii) using
reasonable best efforts to defend all lawsuits and other proceedings by or
before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or the consummation
of the Merger; and (iii) using reasonable best efforts to resolve any
objection asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement, including the Merger, under any Antitrust Law raised by any
Governmental Entity and to prevent the entry of any court order, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any injunction, decree, ruling, order
or other action of any Governmental Entity, that would prevent, prohibit,
restrict or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 5.7(a),
each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly as
practicable, and in any event by no later than five Business Days from the
date of this Agreement, a filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act. In addition, with respect to the Competition Act Approval, (a)
Parent shall file a submission with the Commissioner requesting an advance
ruling certificate ("ARC") or, in lieu thereof, a No-Action Letter ("ARC
Request") no later than ten Business Days from the date of this Agreement, and
(b) unless otherwise agreed by the parties, Parent and the Company shall each
file with the Commissioner the notice and information required under section
114(1) of the Competition Act no later than five Business Days following the
date of the filing of the ARC Request. Parent shall pay all filing fees and
other charges for the filings required under the HSR Act by the Company and
Parent.

(c) If a party receives a request for information or documentary material from
any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the Merger or any of
the other transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to a
Second Request for Information under the HSR Act, then such party shall in
good faith make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and
after consultation with the other party, a response which is, at a minimum, in
substantial compliance with such request.

(d) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and work cooperatively in connection with
obtaining the approvals of or clearances from each applicable Governmental
Entity, including:



(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings required to be made
by any party under any Antitrust Law and liaising with each other in relation
to each step of the procedure before the relevant Governmental Entities and as
to the contents of all communications with such Governmental Entities. In
particular, to the extent permitted by Law or Governmental Entity, no party
will make any notification in relation to the transactions contemplated
hereunder, without first providing the other party with a copy of such notification in draft form and giving such other party a reasonable
opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant
Governmental Entities, and such first party shall consider and take account of
all reasonable comments timely made by the other party in this respect;



(ii) furnishing to the other party all information within its possession that
is required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party
pursuant to applicable Law in connection with this Agreement or the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement;



(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and ensuring to the extent permitted by Law or
Governmental Entity that each of the parties is entitled to attend any
meetings with or other appearances before any Governmental Entity with respect
to this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;



(iv) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to the Antitrust Laws; and



(v) without prejudice to any rights of the parties hereunder, consulting and
cooperating in all respects with the other in defending all lawsuits and other
proceedings by or before any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(e) In addition, Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all other action and
to do, or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable
under all Antitrust Laws to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the expiration of all waiting periods and obtain all other approvals
and any other consents or non-actions required to be obtained in order for the
parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the obligations of Parent under this Section 5.7 shall include
Parent committing to: (i) selling, divesting, or otherwise conveying
particular assets, categories, or portions or parts of assets or businesses of
Parent and its Affiliates; (ii) agreeing to sell, divest, or otherwise convey
any particular asset, category, or portion or part of an asset or business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or subsequent to the
Effective Time; (iii) permitting the Company to sell, divest, or otherwise
convey any of the particular assets, categories, or portions or parts of
assets or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the
Effective Time; and (iv) licensing, holding separate or entering into similar
arrangements with respect to its respective assets or the assets of the
Company or conduct of business arrangements or terminating any and all
existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations as a condition
to obtaining any and all expirations of waiting periods under the HSR Act or
the Competition Act or consents or non- actions from any Governmental Entity, including the Commissioner, necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby;
provided, that Parent and its Affiliates shall not be required to take, or
cause to be taken (and the Company shall not take, without the prior written
consent of Parent), any actions, that would, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on the business,
assets, financial condition or results of operations of Parent, the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Parent and its Affiliates shall not
acquire or agree to acquire any rights, assets, business, Person or division
thereof (through acquisition, license, joint venture, collaboration or
otherwise) if such acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially
increase the risk of not obtaining, or materially delay receipt of, any
applicable clearance, consent, approval or waiver under the HSR Act or
Competition Act with respect to this Agreement.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all commercially and/or competitively
sensitive information and materials of a party will be provided to the other
parties on an outside counsel only basis while, to the extent feasible, making
a version in which the commercial and/or competitively sensitive information
has been redacted available to the other party.

(g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Law" means the Sherman Act, as
amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, the Competition Act, any other Foreign Antitrust
Laws and all other Laws that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

Section 5.8 Employee Matters.

(a) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, provide each
employee who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of
immediately prior to the Closing Date and whose employment continues with the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries from the Closing Date (each,
a "Continuing Employee"), for the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the one-year anniversary thereof (or, if shorter, the employee's
current remaining period of employment) with (i) an annual base salary or
hourly wage rate, as applicable, that is no less than the annual base salary
or hourly wage rate provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) employee benefits (excluding equity and other
long-term incentive awards, change in control and retention bonuses, defined
benefit pension plans and post-employment welfare benefits) that are, on an
aggregate basis, at least substantially comparable to the benefits (excluding
equity and other long-term incentive awards, change in control and retention
bonuses, defined benefit pension plans and post-employment welfare benefits)
provided by the Company to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

(b) As of and after the Effective Time, Parent will, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, recognize all service credited under each Company
Plan in which each Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting and vacation and severance
benefit accruals (but not for purposes of benefit accruals under any other
plan, program or policy, including any defined benefit pension plans) under
any plan, program or policy maintained for the benefit of Continuing Employees after the Effective Time by Parent, its Subsidiaries or the Surviving
Corporation (each, a "Parent Plan"), to the same extent recognized by the
Company under such Company Plan; provided that the foregoing shall not apply
to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of benefits
for purposes of benefit accrual. With respect to each Parent Plan that is a
"welfare benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA), Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cause there to
be waived any pre-existing condition, actively at work requirement, waiting
period, or other eligibility limitation to the extent such pre-existing
condition, actively at work requirement, waiting period, or other eligibility
limitation was not applicable as of immediately prior to the Closing under any
Company Plan and (ii) for the plan year in which Continuing Employees of the
Company transition from Company Plans to other Parent Plans, give effect, in
determining any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations, to claims
incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, Continuing Employees
under similar Company Plans immediately prior to such benefit plan transition
date.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries,
for a period commencing at the Effective Time and ending 90 days thereafter,
not to effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are
defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 or in
any similar state or local Law affecting in whole or in part any site of
employment, facility, operating unit or Continuing Employee.

(d) The Company shall promptly, and in all events by no later than the first
regularly scheduled payroll date that is at least five Business Days following
the Closing Date, pay through the Surviving Corporation's payroll the amounts
due to participants under the LSF9 Cypress Parent LLC Long Term Incentive
Plan, as amended, and the award agreements thereunder (collectively, the "LSF9
LTIP"), as directed by the Principal Stockholder. In accordance with the terms
of that certain Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of February 8,
2017, the Principal Stockholder shall deposit with the Company, by no later
than the Closing Date, an amount in cash equal to the aggregate amount of such
amounts payable to the participants under the LSF9 LTIP, including the
employer portion of all related payroll Taxes. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to terminate the LSF9 LTIP effective as of immediately
following the Closing and to ensure that participants under the LSF9 LTIP have
no further rights thereunder other than the right to receive their payments as
described in this Section 5.8(d). The Company shall provide Parent prior to
the Closing with evidence, reasonably acceptable to Parent, regarding the
action taken to effectuate the foregoing sentence.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) be treated as an amendment to
any Company Plan, Parent Plan or any other benefit plan or arrangement, (ii)
obligate Parent or the Surviving Corporation to maintain any particular
benefit plan or arrangement, (iii) prevent Parent or the Surviving Corporation
from amending or terminating any benefit plan or arrangement, or (iv) create a
right in any Continuing Employee to employment with Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or restrict in any way the rights of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate such Continuing Employee's services at any time for
any reason or no reason. Nothing herein is intended to provide any Continuing
Employee any third party beneficiary rights under this Agreement. Section 5.9 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
hereby, each of the Company and Parent and their respective Board of Directors
shall take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or
minimize the effect of such Takeover Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company and Parent shall as
promptly as practicable notify each other of (a) any notice or other
communication received by such party from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required
in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
if the subject matter of such communication could be material to the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent, (b) any Action commenced or, to such
party's knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relates to the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated hereby or (c) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause or result in any of the
conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VI not being satisfied or
satisfaction of those conditions being materially delayed in violation of any
provision of this Agreement; provided, that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall not (i) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (ii) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice; provided further, that
failure to give prompt notice shall not constitute a failure of a condition
set forth in Article VI except to the extent that the underlying fact or
circumstance not so notified would standing alone constitute such a failure.

Section 5.11 Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any employee may have under
any agreement or Company Plan, from the Effective Time through the sixth
anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
indemnify and hold harmless each present (as of the Effective Time) and former
officer, director or employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
"Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, inquiries, fines, amounts paid in settlement and reasonable fees,
costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in
connection with any pending or threatened Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, (i) arising out of, pertaining to, or by
reason of the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was an officer, director,
employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or,
while a director, officer or employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, (ii)
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the transactions and actions
contemplated hereby), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Time, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and the Company
Charter and Company Bylaws as of the date hereof or (iii) in connection with
the enforcement of any Indemnified Party's rights under this Section 5.11 by
such Indemnified Party or his or her heirs or legal representatives. In the
event of any such pending or threatened Action, including any such Action to
enforce any Indemnified Party's rights under this Section 5.11, (A) each
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to advancement of expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such Action from
Parent and the Surviving Corporation to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws as of the date
hereof prior to the final disposition of such Action; provided, that any
Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to
the extent required by DGCL or the Company Charter or Company Bylaws, to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Person is not entitled
to indemnification under this Agreement or any Law, Contract or other source
for which indemnification may be available, (B) neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any proceeding or threatened action, suit, proceeding,
investigation or claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such
Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation or claim or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing, and (C) the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

(b) Except as may be required by applicable Law, Parent and the Company agree
that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts
or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or in any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as set forth on Section 5.11(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, shall survive the Merger and continue in full force
and effect and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party.

(c) At the Company's option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective
Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions (in both amount
and scope) providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies
of directors' and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability
insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters arising on or before the Effective Time, covering without limitation
the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. If such prepaid
tail policy has been obtained by the Company prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for
its full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the
Surviving Corporation.

(d) If the Company has not purchased such tail policy prior to the Effective
Time, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall either
cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors' and
officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries
or cause to be provided substitute policies or purchase or cause the Surviving
Corporation to purchase, a "tail policy," in either case of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that are not less
advantageous in the aggregate than such policy with respect to matters arising
on or before the Effective Time; provided, however, that after the Effective
Time, Parent shall not be required to pay with respect to such insurance
policies in respect of any one policy year annual premiums in excess of 300%
of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in
respect of the coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto, but in such
case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such
amount; provided further, that if the Surviving Corporation purchases a "tail
policy" and the annual coverage thereunder costs more than 300% of such last
annual premium, the Surviving Corporation shall purchase the maximum amount of

Recommendation Change, shall not issue any such press release or make any
public announcement without the prior consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as

Subsidiaries and/or their respective Representatives expressly for use in
connection with the Debt Financing), except to the extent such liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees),
interest, awards, judgments, penalties and amounts paid in settlement arise of or result from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of the

Parent, Merger Sub and any other Person against the Company or the Company's
Related Parties (as defined below), and none of the Company or the Company's
Related Parties shall have any other liability or obligation (other than to

Acquisition Proposal in the case of a Company-Paid Termination Fee payable

be amended, modified or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of
conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing specifically
designated as an amendment hereto, signed on behalf of each of the parties in
interest at the time of the amendment.

Section 7.5 Extension of Time; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, the parties may, by action taken or authorized by their respective

to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other party, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other parties
set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto or (c)
