 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  



  

 **THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER** (this " **Agreement** ") is made and
entered into as of April 24, 2018, by and between **National Commerce
Corporation** (" **NCC** "), a corporation organized and existing under the
Laws of the State of Delaware, with its principal office in Birmingham,
Alabama; and **Landmark Bancshares, Inc.** **** (" **Landmark** "), a
corporation organized and existing under the Laws of the State of Georgia,
with its principal office in Marietta, Georgia.

  

 ** **

  

 _ **Preamble**_

  

 ** **

  

The respective Boards of Directors of NCC and Landmark have determined that
the transactions described herein are in the best interests of the Parties and
their respective stockholders. This Agreement provides for the acquisition of
Landmark by NCC pursuant to the merger of Landmark with and into NCC (the "
**Merger** "). At the effective time of the Merger, and except as provided
herein, the outstanding shares of capital stock of Landmark shall be converted
into the right to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock of NCC and
a fixed amount of cash. As a result, stockholders of Landmark shall become
stockholders of NCC.

  



  

The transactions described in or otherwise contemplated by this Agreement are
subject to, among other things: (i) the filing by NCC and the effectiveness of
a registration statement with respect to the shares of common stock of NCC to
be issued to stockholders of Landmark in the Merger; (ii) the approval of the
stockholders of Landmark; (iii) the approval of, notice to and/or waiver of
the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Georgia Department of Banking and
Finance; and (iv) the satisfaction of certain other conditions described in
this Agreement. It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that, for
federal income tax purposes, the Merger and the Bank Merger shall each qualify
as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, and that this Agreement shall
constitute, and is adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning
of Section 368(a) of the IRC for purposes of Sections 354, 356 and 361 of the
IRC (and any comparable provision of state law) for federal and applicable
state income tax purposes.

  



  

Certain capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Agreement are
defined in Section 11.1 of this Agreement.

  



  

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the above and the mutual warranties,
representations, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the Parties agree
as follows:

  



  

 **Article 1** 
  _ **Transaction and Terms of Merger**_

conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Landmark shall be merged
with and into NCC in accordance with the provisions of Section 252 of the DGCL
and Section 14-2-1107 of the OCGA. At the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Landmark shall cease. NCC shall be the surviving
corporation resulting from the Merger (the " **Surviving Corporation** ") and
shall continue to be governed by the DGCL. The Merger will be consummated
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, which has been approved and adopted
by the respective Boards of Directors of NCC and Landmark.

Closing shall be at the offices of Maynard, Cooper and Gale, P.C., Birmingham,
Alabama, or such other place as may be mutually agreed upon by the Parties.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless otherwise
mutually agreed upon in writing by the chief executive officers of NCC and
Landmark, the Closing will take place at 9:00 a.m. Central Time on the last
Business Day of the month in which the closing conditions set forth in Article
9 (other than those conditions that are to be satisfied at the Closing) have
been satisfied or waived pursuant to Section 11.4 of this Agreement. The date
of such Closing is referred to herein as the " **Closing Date**."

  



  

 **1.3 ** _ **Effective Time.**_ Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the occurrence of the Closing, the Merger shall become
effective: (a) on the date and at the time that the later of the following
shall occur: (i) the Certificate of Merger required by the DGCL (the "
**Certificate of Merger** ") shall be accepted for filing by the Secretary of
State of Delaware, and (ii) the Articles of Merger required by the OCGA (the "
**Articles of Merger** ") shall be accepted for filing by the Secretary of
State of Georgia; or (b) on such date and at such time subsequent to the date

Parties in the Certificate of Merger and Articles of Merger (provided that
such subsequent date and time shall not be later than a time on the 30th day
after the date on which the Certificate of Merger and Articles of Merger are
filed) (such time is hereinafter referred to as the " **Effective Time** ").
Unless the chief executive officers of NCC and Landmark otherwise mutually
agree in writing, the Parties shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to cause the Effective Time to occur not later than the third day following
the Closing Date.

  



  

 **1.4 ** _ **Voting Agreements.**_ **** Concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and as a material condition hereto, each member
of the Landmark Board and certain executive officers of Landmark are entering
into voting agreements with NCC whereby, among other things, such Persons have
agreed, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to
vote all of the shares of Landmark Common Stock owned by them in favor of this
Agreement and the Merger and to support actions necessary to consummate the
Merger and the Bank Merger (the " **Voting Agreements** ").

  



  

 **1.5 ** _ **Merger of Bank Subsidiaries.**_ **** At the later of the
Effective Time or such time as provided in Section 8.12, First Landmark Bank,
a Georgia banking corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Landmark ("
**First Landmark Bank** "), will be merged (the " **Bank Merger** ") with and
into National Bank of Commerce, a national banking association and wholly
owned subsidiary of NCC (" **NBC** "), with NBC as the surviving association,
upon the terms and with the effect set forth in an agreement and plan of
merger (the " **Bank Merger Agreement** ") in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_.

  



  

 **Article 2** 
  _ **Effect of THE Merger**_

  



  

 **2.1 ** _ **Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.**_ **** The
Certificate of Incorporation of NCC in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation immediately after the Effective Time, unless and until amended in
accordance with applicable Law. The Bylaws of NCC in effect immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
immediately after the Effective Time, unless and until amended in accordance
with applicable Law.

  



  

   

  



  

 **2.2 ** _ **Directors and Officers.**_ **** The **** directors of the
Surviving Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall consist
of the directors of NCC immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such
directors shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that NCC shall take any and all steps required under
its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to increase the size of the NCC
Board as of the Effective Time and to appoint the Landmark Designee, effective
as of the Effective Time, to fill such vacancy. Thereafter, NCC agrees to
include the Landmark Designee in its recommended slate of nominees for
election as a director at each of its first and second annual meetings of
stockholders of NCC following the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 2.2
shall require NCC to elect, appoint, nominate or recommend the Landmark
Designee for election to the NCC Board if he or she shall become the subject
of a Disqualification; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Landmark Designee
becomes the subject of a Disqualification prior to the Effective Time, NCC
shall select a substitute Landmark Designee. The officers of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall consist of the
officers of NCC immediately prior to the Effective Time, and such officers
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. _ ****_

  



  

 **2.3 ** _ **Effect of the Merger.**_ At the Effective Time, the Merger
shall have the effect set forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the DGCL and the
comparable provisions of the OCGA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, all rights, franchises and interests of Landmark and NCC in and to
every type of property (real, personal and mixed) and choses in action shall
be transferred to and vested in the Surviving Corporation by virtue of the
Merger without any deed or other transfer. The Surviving Corporation shall
hold and enjoy all rights of property, franchises and interests, including
appointments, designations and nominations, and all other rights and interests
as trustee, executor, administrator, registrar of stocks and bonds, guardian
of estates, assignee and receiver, and in every other fiduciary capacity, in
the same manner and to the same extent as such rights, franchises and
interests were held or enjoyed by Landmark and NCC immediately prior to the
Effective Time. All Liabilities and obligations of Landmark and NCC shall be
assumed by the Surviving Corporation, and the Surviving Corporation shall be
bound thereby in the same manner and to the same extent as each of Landmark
and NCC was so bound at the Effective Time.

  



  

 **Article 3** 
  _ **Conversion of constituents ' CAPITAL STOCK AND OTHER EQUITY**_

  



  

 **3.1 ** _ **Manner of Converting Equity Securities.**_ Subject to the
provisions of this Article 3, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any further action on the part of NCC, Landmark or the holders of
any shares of capital stock thereof, the shares of capital stock and the
rights and options to acquire shares of capital stock of the constituent
corporations shall be converted as follows:

  



  

(a) _NCC Capital Stock_. Each share of capital stock of NCC issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall continue to be an
issued and outstanding share of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation
from and after the Effective Time.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) _Cancellation of Certain Shares of Landmark Common Stock_. Each share
of Landmark Common Stock that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, is
held as a Landmark Treasury Share or that is owned, directly or indirectly, by
any Landmark Company or any NCC Company (other than shares of Landmark Common
Stock held in trust accounts (including grantor or rabbi trust accounts),
managed accounts and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency
capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties, and other than shares
of Landmark Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, in respect of a debt
previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist at the
Effective Time without any conversion thereof, and no shares of NCC Common
Stock, cash or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

  



  

(c) _Per Share Merger Consideration for Landmark Common Stock_. Subject
to Section 3.2, each share of Landmark Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding (i) shares cancelled
pursuant to Section 3.1(b) and (ii) shares held by stockholders who perfect
their dissenters' rights of appraisal as provided in Section 3.3) shall cease
to be outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to
receive (i) 0.5961 shares of NCC Common Stock (the " **Per Share Exchange
Ratio** "), _plus_ (ii) $1.33 in cash, without interest (the " **Per Share
Cash Consideration** "), _plus_ (iii) any cash, without interest, in lieu of
fractional shares as specified in Section 3.4. The Per Share Exchange Ratio
and the Per Share Cash Consideration are collectively referred to as the "
**Per Share Merger Consideration**."

  



  

(d) _Landmark Options_. At the Effective Time, each outstanding and
unexercised option to purchase shares of Landmark Common Stock pursuant to the
Landmark Equity Incentive Plans (each, a " **Landmark Option** ") will cease
to represent an option to purchase Landmark Common Stock and will be converted
automatically into an option to purchase NCC Common Stock (each, an " **NCC
Option** "), and NCC will assume each Landmark Equity Incentive Plan and each
Landmark Option subject to its terms, including any acceleration in vesting
that will occur as a consequence of the Merger according to any instrument,
plan or agreement governing such Landmark Option; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, after the Effective Time:

  



  

(i) the number of shares of NCC Common Stock purchasable upon exercise
of each Landmark Option will equal the product of (A) the number of shares of
Landmark Common Stock that were purchasable under the Landmark Option
immediately before the Effective Time and (B) 0.6275 (the " **Option
Conversion Ratio** "), rounded down to the nearest whole share;

  



  

(ii) the per share exercise price for each Landmark Option will equal the
quotient obtained by dividing (A) the per share exercise price of the Landmark
Option in effect immediately before the Effective Time by (B) the Option
Conversion Ratio, rounded up to the nearest cent; and

  



  

   

  



  

(iii) where the context so requires, all references in the Landmark Equity
Incentive Plans (and related award agreements and other documentation) to
Landmark shall be deemed to be references to NCC and its Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and all references to the Landmark Board (or the Compensation
Committee thereof) shall be deemed to be references to the NCC Board (or the
Compensation Committee thereof).

  



  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Landmark Option that is intended to be an
"incentive stock option" (as defined in Section 422 of the IRC) will be
adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the IRC. As of
the date hereof, the Landmark Options provide for the purchase of no more than
an aggregate of 323,635 additional shares of Landmark Common Stock. As soon as
practicable after the Effective Time, NCC shall file a Registration Statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate forms) with the SEC with
respect to each of the Landmark Equity Incentive Plans assumed by NCC and the
shares of NCC Common Stock subject to the assumed Landmark Options that were
originally granted under such Landmark Equity Incentive Plans. NCC shall use
its reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of each such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
associated therewith) for so long as such assumed Landmark Options remain
outstanding. Subject to the foregoing, the Landmark Equity Incentive Plans
shall be frozen as of the Effective Time such that no additional options shall
be available or granted thereunder following the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) _Maximum Consideration_. Assuming that (i) there are no Landmark
Dissenting Shares, (ii) there is no adjustment to the Per Share Exchange Ratio
or the Option Conversion Ratio pursuant to Section 3.2, (iii) none of the
Landmark Options is exercised prior to the Effective Time, and (iv) following
the Effective Time, all of the NCC Options representing the assumed Landmark
Options are exercised by the holders thereof by paying the exercise price in
cash, the holders of Landmark Common Stock and NCC Options representing the
assumed Landmark Options shall have the right to receive, in the aggregate, a
maximum of 2,528,367 **** shares of NCC Common Stock and a maximum of
$5,188,107 in aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration as a result of the
Merger.

  



  

 **3.2 ** _ **Anti-Dilution Provisions.**_ **** If NCC changes the number
of shares of NCC Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time as a result of a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend or
similar recapitalization with respect to such stock and the record date
therefor is prior to the Effective Time, then the Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately adjusted as needed to preserve the relative economic benefit
to the Parties provided for in Section 3.1(c) and Section 3.1(d).

  



  

   

  



  

 **3.3 ** _ **Landmark Dissenting Stockholders.**_ Notwithstanding the
provisions of Section 3.1 or anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Landmark Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who properly
dissents from the Merger (" **Landmark Dissenting Shares** ") when and in the
manner required by Sections 14-2-1301 _et seq._ of the OCGA (the " **Dissenter
Provisions** ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration, but instead the holder of such Landmark Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value thereof in accordance
with the Dissenter Provisions. At the Effective Time, such Landmark Dissenting
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist or be outstanding, and the holder thereof
shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the fair value of such Landmark Dissenting Shares in accordance with
the Dissenter Provisions; _provided_ , _however_ , that no payment shall be
made with respect to any Landmark Dissenting Shares unless and until the
holder thereof shall have complied with the applicable provisions of the
Dissenter Provisions and surrendered to the Surviving Corporation the
certificate or certificates representing the Landmark Dissenting Shares for
which payment is to be made. If any holder of shares of Landmark Common Stock
shall have failed to perfect such holder's right to receive, or shall have
effectively waived, withdrawn, lost or forfeited any right to demand or
receive, the fair value of such Landmark Common Stock under the Dissenter
Provisions, then such holder's shares of Landmark Common Stock shall thereupon
be deemed and treated as if they had, at the Effective Time, been converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance
with Section 3.1(c). Landmark shall give NCC (i) prompt notice upon receipt by
Landmark of any written notices of any holder's intent to demand payment or
exercise appraisal rights in respect of any shares of Landmark Common Stock,
withdrawals or attempted withdrawals of such notices and any other notices or
instruments served pursuant to the Dissenter Provisions and received by
Landmark relating to any attempted, purported or actual exercise of appraisal
rights and (ii) the opportunity to participate in, direct and control all
discussions, negotiations and proceedings with respect to the exercise of such
appraisal rights under the Dissenter Provisions. Each holder of Landmark
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled, pursuant to the Dissenter Provisions,
to payment for any Landmark Dissenting Shares shall receive payment therefor
from the Surviving Corporation (but only after the amount thereof shall have
been agreed upon or at the times and in the amounts required by the Dissenter
Provisions). Landmark shall not, except with the prior written consent of NCC,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any demand for payment by a holder of Landmark Dissenting Shares. Nothing
contained in this Section 3.3 shall in any way limit the right of NCC to
terminate this Agreement and abandon the Merger under Section 10.1(i).

  



  

 **3.4 ** _ **Fractional Shares.**_ Fractional shares of NCC Common Stock
shall not be issued upon the surrender of certificates representing Landmark
Common Stock or transfer of uncertificated shares of Landmark Common Stock for
exchange; no dividend or distribution with respect to NCC Common Stock shall
be payable on or with respect to any fractional share; and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of NCC. In lieu of any such fractional share, NCC
shall pay to each former stockholder of Landmark who otherwise would be
entitled to receive a fractional share of NCC Common Stock an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to the product of (i) the Average Quoted Price
multiplied by (ii) the fraction of a share of NCC Common Stock to which such
stockholder would otherwise be entitled.

  



  

   

  



  

 **Article 4** 
  _ **exchange of EQUITY SECURITIES**_

  



  

 **4.1 ** _ **Exchange Procedures.**_ **** At or before the Effective
Time, NCC shall deposit, or shall cause to deposited, with the Exchange Agent
a sufficient amount of cash to cover the aggregate Per Share Cash
Consideration payable under the terms hereof, and NCC shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to timely pay such consideration in accordance with this
Agreement. Promptly (and within five (5) Business Days) after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to the
former holders of Landmark Common Stock appropriate transmittal materials
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the certificates theretofore representing shares of Landmark Common
Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such certificates to the
Exchange Agent). Upon (a) surrender to the Transfer Agent of one or more
certificates theretofore representing shares of Landmark Common Stock (each, a
" **Landmark Certificate** ") for exchange and cancellation, duly endorsed as
the Exchange Agent may require, or (b) delivery to the Transfer Agent of such
documentation evidencing the transfer and surrender of uncertificated shares
of Landmark Common Stock (each, an " **Uncertificated Share** ") as NCC or the
Transfer Agent may require (all such shares, whether theretofore represented
by a Landmark Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, to be free and clear of
all liens, claims and encumbrances), together with a properly executed letter
of transmittal, the holder of such Landmark Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares shall be entitled to receive promptly thereafter in exchange therefor:
(a) that number of whole shares of NCC Common Stock that such holder of
Landmark Common Stock became entitled to receive pursuant to Article 3 hereof
and (b) a check representing the aggregate cash consideration that such holder
has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of Article 3 hereof
(rounded to the nearest cent), and the Landmark Certificate (and the shares of
Landmark Common Stock theretofore represented thereby) and Uncertificated
Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. The shares of NCC Common
Stock to be issued pursuant to Article 3 and this Section 4.1 shall be in
uncertificated book entry form, and upon compliance by a former holder of
Landmark Common Stock with the provisions hereof and of the letter of
transmittal, NCC shall instruct its registrar and transfer agent to make
appropriate book entries with respect to such shares of NCC Common Stock. Such
book entries of the issuance of uncertificated shares shall constitute
delivery thereof for all purposes pursuant to this Agreement. No interest will
be paid or accrued on the Per Share Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares or any unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable
to former holders of Landmark Common Stock. None of NCC, the Surviving
Corporation, NBC or the Exchange Agent shall be obligated to deliver the
consideration to which any former holder of Landmark Common Stock is entitled
as a result of the Merger until such holder surrenders the Landmark
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares held by such holder for exchange as
provided in this Section 4.1.

  



  

   

  



  

 **4.2 ** _ **Rights of Former Landmark Stockholders.**_ At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of Landmark shall be closed as to holders of
Landmark Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and no transfer
of Landmark Common Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or
recognized. Until surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions
of Section 4.1 of this Agreement, each Landmark Certificate (and the shares of
Landmark Common Stock theretofore represented thereby) and all Uncertificated
Shares, other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) of this
Agreement or as to which dissenter's rights of appraisal have been perfected
as provided in Section 3.3 of this Agreement, shall from and after the
Effective Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the
consideration provided in Section 3.1 of this Agreement in exchange therefor.
To the extent permitted by Law, former stockholders of record of Landmark
Common Stock shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting
of NCC stockholders (with a record date after the Effective Time) the number
of whole shares of NCC Common Stock into which their respective shares of
Landmark Common Stock have been converted, regardless of whether such holders
have exchanged their Landmark Certificates or Uncertificated Shares for shares
of NCC Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Whenever a dividend or other distribution is declared by NCC on the NCC Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, the
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions on all shares
issuable pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
any Person holding any Landmark Certificate or Uncertificated Shares at or
after six (6) months after the Effective Time (the " **Cutoff** ") shall not
be entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution payable after the
Cutoff to holders of NCC Common Stock, which dividend or other distribution is
attributable to such Person's NCC Common Stock represented by said Landmark
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares held after the Cutoff, until such Person
surrenders such Landmark Certificate or Uncertificated Shares for exchange as
provided in Section 4.1 of this Agreement. However, upon surrender of such
Landmark Certificate or Uncertificated Shares, **** appropriate book entries
shall be made with respect to the NCC Common Stock, and all such undelivered
dividends or other distributions (without interest) and any undelivered cash
payments (without interest) shall be delivered and paid with respect to each
share represented by such Landmark Certificate or Uncertificated Shares. No
holder of shares of Landmark Common Stock shall be entitled to voting rights
or to receive any dividends or distributions declared or made with respect to
the NCC Common Stock with a record date before the Effective Time.

  



  

 **4.3 ** _ **Identity of Recipient of NCC Common Stock.**_ In the event
that the delivery of the consideration provided for in this Agreement is to be
made to a Person other than the Person in whose name any Landmark Certificate
or Uncertificated Share surrendered is registered, such Landmark Certificate
or Uncertificated Share so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer), with the signature(s)
appropriately guaranteed, and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and the
Person requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other taxes required
by reason of the delivery to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Landmark Certificate or Uncertificated Share surrendered or establish to the
satisfaction of NCC that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

  



  

 **4.4 ** _ **Lost or Stolen Certificates.**_ If any holder of Landmark
Common Stock evidenced by a Landmark Certificate that is convertible into the
right to receive shares of NCC Common Stock or cash is unable to deliver such
holder's Landmark Certificate, NCC shall instruct its registrar and transfer
agent, in the absence of actual notice that any such shares have been acquired
by a bona fide purchaser, to make appropriate book entries with respect to
such holder for the shares of NCC Common Stock to which the holder is entitled
for such shares upon presentation of the following: (a) evidence to the
reasonable satisfaction of NCC that any such Landmark Certificate has been
lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed; (b) such security or indemnity as may be
reasonably requested by NCC to indemnify and hold NCC and the Exchange Agent
harmless; and (c) evidence satisfactory to NCC that such Person is the owner
of the shares theretofore represented by each Landmark Certificate claimed by
the holder to be lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed and that the holder is
the Person who would be entitled to present such Landmark Certificate for
exchange pursuant to this Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

 **4.5 ** _ **Laws of Escheat.**_ If any of the consideration due or
other payments to be paid or delivered to the holders of Landmark Common Stock
is not paid or delivered within the time period specified by any applicable
Laws concerning abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws, and if such
failure to pay or deliver such consideration occurs or arises out of the fact
that such property is not claimed by the proper owner thereof, NCC or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled (but not required) to dispose of any such
consideration or other payments in accordance with applicable Laws concerning
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any other provision of this
Agreement notwithstanding, none of NCC, the Surviving Corporation, NBC,
Landmark, the Exchange Agent or any other Person acting on their behalf shall
be liable to a holder of Landmark Common Stock for any amount paid or property
delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to and in accordance
with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

  



  

 **4.6 ** _ **Withholding Rights.**_ Notwithstanding any provision
contained herein to the contrary, each of the Exchange Agent, Landmark, First
Landmark Bank, NCC, the Surviving Corporation and NBC shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any provision of Tax
law. If the Exchange Agent, Landmark, First Landmark Bank, NCC, the Surviving
Corporation or NBC, as the case may be, so withholds and timely remits such
amounts to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
entitled to such payment under this Agreement or holder of the shares of
Landmark Common Stock in respect of which the Exchange Agent, Landmark, First
Landmark Bank, NCC, the Surviving Corporation or NBC, as the case may be, made
such deduction and withholding.

  



  

 **Article 5** 
  _ **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF LANDMARK**_

  



  

Landmark hereby represents and warrants to NCC as follows:

  



  

 **5.1 ** _ **Organization, Standing and Power.**_ Landmark is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Georgia, and has the corporate power and authority to
carry on its business as now conducted and to own, lease and operate its
Assets and to incur its Liabilities. Landmark is duly qualified or licensed to
transact business as a foreign corporation in good standing in the states of
the United States and foreign jurisdictions where the character of its Assets
or the nature or conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or
licensed, except for such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so
qualified or licensed is not reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Landmark. Landmark has delivered to
NCC complete and correct copies of its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
and the articles or certificate of incorporation, bylaws or similar governing
instruments of each of its Subsidiaries, in each case as amended through the
date hereof.

  



  

 **5.2 ** _ **Authority; No Breach By Agreement.**_

  



  

(a) Landmark has the corporate power and authority necessary to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and to
consummate the transactions provided for herein. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
provided for herein, including the Merger, have been duly and validly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Landmark, subject
to the approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the holders of a majority
of the outstanding shares of Landmark Common Stock in accordance with the OCGA
and Landmark's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. Subject to such requisite
stockholder approval and required regulatory Consents, this Agreement
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Landmark, enforceable
against Landmark in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar Laws of general
applicability affecting creditors' rights or by general principles of equity.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.2(b)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Landmark or the Bank Merger Agreement by First
Landmark Bank, nor the consummation by Landmark of the transactions provided
for in this Agreement or by First Landmark Bank of the transactions provided
for in the Bank Merger Agreement, nor compliance by Landmark with any of the
provisions hereof or by First Landmark Bank with any of the provisions of the
Bank Merger Agreement, does or will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of

of real property owned or used by any Landmark Company, no Landmark Company
has received notice of any pending or, to the Knowledge of each of the
Landmark Companies, threatened condemnation proceedings, Litigation
proceedings or mechanic's or materialmen's liens. The Assets of the Landmark
Companies include all Assets required to operate the business of the Landmark
Companies as now conducted. The policies of fire, theft, liability, DandO and

practices against loss or Liability, and the fidelity and blanket bonds in

be, in compliance with any of the Laws or Orders that such Governmental
Authority or Regulatory Authority enforces, (ii) threatening to revoke any
Permits, (iii) requiring any Landmark Company, or suggesting that any Landmark

the Knowledge of any Landmark Company, any director, officer, agent, employee,
Affiliate or Person acting on behalf of any Landmark Company is currently

the economic sanctions of OFAC or any other Regulatory Authority. No Landmark
Company is controlled (within the meaning of Laws administered by OFAC) by any

organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is there any strike
or other labor dispute involving any Landmark Company pending or threatened,
nor to its Knowledge, is there any activity involving any Landmark Company's

 **5.15 ** _ **Employee Benefit Plans.**_

  



  

(a) _Schedule 5.15(a)_ lists, and Landmark has delivered or made
available to NCC prior to the execution of this Agreement, correct and
complete information with respect to, and copies of, all pension, retirement,
profit-sharing, employee stock ownership, salary continuation, deferred
compensation and split dollar policies, plans and agreements; all director
deferral and director retirement policies, plans and agreements; all equity-
based policies, plans and agreements relating to grants of stock options,
warrants, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other equity awards; all
policies, plans and agreements relating to severance pay, vacation and paid-
time-off; all cash or equity-based bonus plans and any other incentive plans;
all other written or unwritten employee programs, arrangements or agreements;
all medical, vision, dental or other health plans, all life insurance plans,
and all other employee benefit plans, cafeteria plans or fringe benefit plans,
including, without limitation, "employee benefit plans," as defined in Section
3(3) of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), adopted, maintained by,
sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to by any Landmark Company,
any Affiliate of a Landmark Company or any ERISA Affiliate thereof within the
last six (6) years for the benefit of employees, retirees, dependents,
spouses, directors, independent contractors or other beneficiaries
(collectively, the " **Landmark Benefit Plans** "). Landmark also has
delivered or made available to NCC prior to the execution of this Agreement
correct and complete copies of (where applicable) the following with respect
to each of the Landmark Benefit Plans: (i) all current summary plan
descriptions and summaries of material modifications; (ii) the most recent
determination or opinion letters, as applicable, received from the Internal
Revenue Service; (iii) the three (3) most recent Form 5500 Annual Reports;
(iv) the three (3) most recent audited financial statements and actuarial
valuations; (v) all material related agreements, trust agreements (including
master trust agreements), funding policies, insurance Contracts and other
documents that implement or impact the Landmark Benefit Plan; and (vi) any
notices to or from the Internal Revenue Service, any office or representative
of the Department of Labor or any other Governmental Authority relating to any
material compliance issues in respect of any Landmark Benefit Plan. Any
Landmark Benefit Plan that is an "employee pension benefit plan," as defined
in Section 3(2) of ERISA, is referred to herein as a " **Landmark ERISA
Plan**." Except as set forth and identified on _Schedule 5.15(a)_ , no
Landmark Benefit Plan is or has been a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in
Section 414(j) of the IRC) or a "multi-employer plan" (as defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA), a multiple employer plan (as defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA or Section 413(c) of the IRC), or a multiple employer welfare
arrangement (as defined in Section 3(40)(A) of ERISA), and no ERISA Affiliate
of any Landmark Company maintains, sponsors or contributes to, or has ever
maintained, sponsored or contributed to, any such employee benefit plan.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) All Landmark Benefit Plans and the administration thereof are in, and
have been in, compliance with the applicable terms of ERISA, the IRC and any
other applicable Laws, except for instances of non-compliance that would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Landmark. Each Landmark ERISA Plan that is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC and each corresponding trust exempt
under Section 501(a) of the IRC has received a favorable determination letter
or may rely upon an opinion letter issued to the sponsor of a prototype or
volume submitter arrangement, as applicable, from the Internal Revenue
Service, and Landmark is not aware of any circumstances that could result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter/opinion letter. No
transaction has been entered into with respect to any Landmark Benefit Plan
that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, would subject any Landmark Company to a tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the IRC or Section 502(i) of ERISA in amounts that are
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on Landmark. There are no actions, suits, arbitrations or
claims, including any investigations or audits by the Internal Revenue Service
or any other Governmental Authority pending (other than routine claims for
benefits) or threatened against any Landmark Benefit Plan, any Landmark
Company or any ERISA Affiliate with regard to any Landmark Benefit Plan or
related trust. To the Knowledge of Landmark, there are no actions, suits,
arbitrations or claims, including any investigations or audits by the Internal
Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority, pending (other than
routine claims for benefits) or threatened against any trustee, fiduciary,
custodian, administrator or other Person holding or controlling Assets of any
Landmark Benefit Plan respecting such Landmark Benefit Plan, and no basis for
anticipating any such action, suit, arbitration, claim, investigation or audit
exists.

  



  

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.15(c)_ , neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions provided
for herein will (i) result in any payment (including, without limitation,
severance, unemployment compensation, golden parachute or otherwise) becoming
due to any director, officer or employee of any Landmark Company from any
Landmark Company or any NCC Company under any Landmark Benefit Plan,
employment Contract or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable
under any Landmark Benefit Plan, (iii) result in any acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any such benefit, or (iv) increase any amounts
payable by, or result in any other material obligation to, any Landmark
Company or any NCC Company with respect to any trust maintained in connection
with a Landmark Benefit Plan.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) With respect to all Landmark Benefit Plans (whether or not subject to
ERISA and whether or not qualified under Section 401(a) of the IRC), all
contributions due (including any contributions to any trust account or
payments due under any insurance policy) or previously declared or otherwise
required by Law or Contract to have been made and any employer contributions
(including any contributions to any trust account or payments due under any
insurance policy) accrued but unpaid as of the date hereof will be paid by the
time required by Law or Contract, inclusive of available extensions and grace
periods. All contributions required to be made under any Landmark Benefit Plan
have been made by the applicable due date, inclusive of available extensions
and grace periods, and meet the requirements for deductibility under the IRC,
and all contributions that are required and that have not been made have been
properly recorded on the books of Landmark in accordance with GAAP.

  



  

(e) Each Contract, arrangement, plan, or Landmark Benefit Plan that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined for purposes of Section
409A(d)(1) of the IRC) has been maintained and is, in form and operation, in
compliance with Section 409A of the IRC and the applicable guidance issued
thereunder, except to the extent of any applicable grandfathering or delayed
effective dates permitted by transitional guidance issued by the U.S.
Department of the Treasury under Section 409A of the IRC. No amounts under
any such Contract, arrangement, plan, or Landmark Benefit Plan are or have
been subject to the interest or additional tax set forth under Section
409A(a)(1)(B) of the IRC. No Landmark Company or any of their Affiliates has
any obligation to gross-up or indemnify any Person with respect to any Taxes
imposed under Section 409A of the IRC.

  



  

(f) (i) Each Landmark Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan"
(within the meaning of Section 5000(b)(1) of the IRC) has been operated in
compliance in all material respects with all Laws applicable to such plan
(including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010), its terms,
and with the group health plan continuation coverage requirements of Section
4980B of the IRC and Sections 601 through 608 of ERISA (" **COBRA Coverage**
"), Section 4980D of the IRC and Sections 701 through 707 of ERISA, Title XXII
of the Public Health Service Act and the provisions of the Social Security
Act, to the extent that such requirements are applicable, including, but not
limited to, the availability of any applicable grandfathering or delayed
effective dates. Other than as required under COBRA Coverage or other similar
applicable Law, no Landmark Benefit Plan or written or oral agreement exists
that obligates the Landmark Companies or any ERISA Affiliate to provide health
care coverage, medical, surgical, hospitalization, death or similar benefits
(whether or not insured) to any employee, former employee or member of the
Landmark Board or any ERISA Affiliate following such employee's, former
employee's or director's termination of employment or service to Landmark,
including, but not limited to, retiree medical, health or life benefits.

  



  

(ii) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.15(f)(ii)_ , no Landmark Benefit
Plan, excluding any short-term disability, non-qualified deferred
compensation, vacation, bonus, fringe benefit or health flexible spending
account plan or program, is self-insured or funded through the general Assets
of a Landmark Company or an ERISA Affiliate. No Landmark Benefit Plan that is
an employee welfare benefit plan under Section 3(1) of ERISA is funded by a
trust or is subject to Section 419 or 419A of the IRC.

  



  

   

  



  

 **5.16 ** _ **Material Contracts.**_ Except as set forth on _Schedule
5.16_ , none of the Landmark Companies, nor any of their respective Assets,

**Related Interest** ") of any of the foregoing; (g) any Contract that limits
the freedom of any of the Landmark Companies to compete in any line of
business or with any Person or that limits the freedom of any other Person to
compete in any line of business with any Landmark Company; (h) any Contract
providing a power of attorney or similar authorization given by any of the
Landmark Companies, except as issued in the ordinary course of business with
respect to routine matters; or (i) any Contract (other than deposit agreements
and certificates of deposits issued to customers entered into in the ordinary
course of business and letters of credit) that involves the payment by any of
the Landmark Companies of amounts aggregating $50,000 or more in any twelve-

none of the Landmark Companies is in Default under any Landmark Contract.
Other than the Subordinated Debentures, the Industrial Development Revenue

course of business and the other Indebtedness set forth on _Schedule 5.16_ ,
all of the Indebtedness of any Landmark Company is prepayable at any time by
such Landmark Company without penalty or premium. _Schedule 5.16_ lists the
deadlines for extensions or terminations of all Landmark Contracts.

  



  

 **5.17 ** _ **Legal Proceedings.**_ **** Except as set forth on
_Schedule 5.17_ , there is no Litigation instituted or pending, or, to the
Knowledge of any Landmark Company, threatened (or unasserted but considered
probable of assertion) against any Landmark Company, or against any Asset,
interest, or right of any of them, other than any immaterial, ordinary routine
Litigation incidental to the business of Landmark and its Subsidiaries, nor
are there any Orders of any Governmental Authorities, Regulatory Authorities
or arbitrators outstanding, pending or, to the Knowledge of any Landmark
Company, threatened against any Landmark Company. No Landmark Company has any
Knowledge of any fact or condition presently existing that might give rise to
any Order, Litigation, investigation or proceeding that, if determined
adversely to any Landmark Company, would have a Material Adverse Effect on
such Landmark Company or would materially restrict the right of any Landmark
Company to carry on its businesses as presently conducted.

  



  

   

  



  

 **5.18 ** _ **Reports.**_ Each Landmark Company has timely filed all
reports, registration statements, statements and other documents, together

relating to any transaction or relationship between or among Landmark and any
other Landmark Company, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or

is or may be in a position to help or hinder the business of any Landmark
Company (or assist any Landmark Company in connection with any actual or
proposed transaction) that (a) might subject Landmark to any damage or penalty
in any civil, criminal or governmental Litigation or proceeding, (b) if not
given in the past, might have resulted in a Material Adverse Effect on
Landmark or (c) if not continued in the future, might result in a Material
Adverse Effect on Landmark or might subject Landmark to suit or penalty in any
private or governmental Litigation or proceeding.

  



  

 **5.32 ** _ **Information Privacy; Data Security.**_

  



  

(a) The Landmark Companies collectively are the sole owner of all
individually identifiable personal information relating to identifiable or
identified natural Persons (" **Identifiable Personal Information** ") with
respect to customers, former customers, prospective customers and employees.
The Landmark Companies' collection, use and transfer of such Identifiable
Personal Information complies with Landmark's privacy policy, the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and all other applicable privacy and
other applicable Laws, and any agreement or industry standard relating to
privacy.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.32(b)_ , the Landmark Companies
have not experienced any actual, suspected or alleged incidents of data
security breaches or unauthorized access, disclosure, acquisition,
destruction, loss, alteration, corruption or use of any Identifiable Personal
Information in the past three (3) years. The Landmark Companies have not
received and are not aware of any notices, complaints or claims, including
from any Governmental Authority or other Person, relating to Data Security
Requirements. Neither the Merger nor the Bank Merger will result in any
Liabilities in connection with any Data Security Requirements.

  



  

(c) The Landmark Companies (i) maintain commercially reasonable backup and
data recovery, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, procedures and
facilities; (ii) act in material compliance therewith; and (iii) test such
plans and procedures on a regular basis, and such plans and procedures have
been proven effective in all material respects upon such testing.

  



  

 **5.33 ** _ **Deposits.**_ Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.33_ , none
of the deposits of Landmark is a "brokered" deposit or is subject to any
encumbrance, legal restraint or other legal process (other than garnishments,
pledges, setoff rights, limitations applicable to public deposits, escrow
limitations and similar actions taken in the ordinary course of business), and
no portion of deposits of Landmark represents a deposit of any Affiliate of
Landmark. The deposit accounts of First Landmark Bank are insured by the FDIC
in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, and
First Landmark Bank has paid all regular premiums and special assessments and
filed all reports required thereunder.

  



  

 **5.34 ** _ **Accounting Controls.**_ Each of the Landmark Companies
maintains accurate books and records reflecting its Assets and Liabilities and
maintains proper and adequate internal accounting controls that provide
assurance that (a) transactions are executed with management's general or
specific authorizations; (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of the Landmark Financial Statements and Landmark Call Reports in
accordance with GAAP and RAP, and to maintain Asset and Liability
accountability; (c) access to each Landmark Company's Assets and incurrence of
each Landmark Company's Liabilities are permitted only in accordance with
management's specific or general authorizations; (d) the recorded
accountability for Assets and Liabilities is compared with the existing Assets
and Liabilities at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with
respect to any difference; and (e) extensions of credit and other receivables
are recorded accurately, and proper and adequate procedures are implemented to
effect the collection thereof on a current and timely basis. None of
Landmark's systems, controls, data or information are recorded, stored,
maintained, operated or otherwise wholly or partly dependent on or held by any
means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that (including all means of access thereto and
therefrom) are not under the exclusive ownership and direct control of the
Landmark Companies or their accountants, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Landmark. No Landmark Company
has been advised of any material deficiencies in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that could reasonably be expected
to adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data, or any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management. No material weakness in internal controls has been identified by
Landmark's auditors, and there have been no significant changes in internal
controls that could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect
internal controls.

  



  

   

  



  

 **5.35 ** _ **Corporate Records.**_ The minute books of Landmark and
each Landmark Subsidiary contain complete and accurate records in all material
respects of all meetings and other corporate actions held or taken by Landmark

(including all committees thereof) since such entity's formation.

  



  

 **5.36 ** _ **No Broker-Dealer.**_ Except as set forth on _Schedule
5.36_ , no Landmark Company and no employee or agent thereof is registered or
required to be registered as an investment adviser or broker/dealer under the
Securities Laws. To Landmark's Knowledge, all activities with respect to the
solicitation, offer, marketing and/or sale of securities under "networking" or
similar arrangements: (a) are and have at all times been conducted in
accordance with all applicable Laws, including, without limitation, the
Securities Laws, all state securities Laws and all state and federal banking
Laws and regulations, and (b) satisfy the definition of a "third party
brokerage arrangement" under Section 201 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999

provided with any and all disclosure materials as required by applicable Law.

any obligation, contingent or otherwise, to register its securities under the
1933 Act, the 1934 Act or any state securities Laws.

  _ **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF NCC**_

  



  

Except as disclosed in any publicly available report, statement, schedule,
form or other document filed by NCC with the SEC in each case after January 1,
2018 and prior to the date hereof (but excluding any risk factor disclosures
contained under the heading "Risk Factors," any disclosure of risks included
in any "forward-looking statements" disclaimer or any other statements that
are similarly cautionary, non-specific or predictive or forward-looking in
nature), NCC hereby represents and warrants to Landmark as follows:

  



  

 **6.1 ** _ **Organization, Standing and Power.**_ NCC is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws of the
State of Delaware, and has the corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now conducted and to own, lease and operate its Assets and to
incur its Liabilities. NCC is duly qualified or licensed to transact business
as a foreign corporation in good standing in the states of the United States
and foreign jurisdictions where the character of its Assets or the nature or
conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified or licensed, except for
such jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed is not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on NCC.

  



  

   

  



  

 **6.2 ** _ **Authority; No Breach By Agreement.**_

  



  

(a) NCC has the corporate power and authority necessary to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions provided for herein. The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions provided for herein
have been, or prior to the Effective Time will be, duly and validly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of NCC. Subject to required
regulatory Consents, this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of NCC, enforceable against NCC in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar Laws of general applicability affecting creditors'
rights or by general principles of equity.

  



  

(b) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by NCC or of the
Bank Merger Agreement by NBC, nor the consummation by NCC of the transactions
provided for in this Agreement or by NBC of the transactions provided for in
the Bank Merger Agreement, nor compliance by NCC with any of the provisions of
this Agreement or by NBC with any of the provisions of the Bank Merger
Agreement, will (i) conflict with or result in a breach of any provision of
NCC's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or similar governing documents of
NBC, (ii) constitute or result in a Default under, or require any Consent
pursuant to, or result in the creation of any Lien on any Asset of any NCC
Company under, any Contract or Permit of any NCC Company, where failure to

aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on such NCC Company, or (iii) subject to
receipt of the requisite approvals referred to in Section 9.1(b) of this
Agreement, violate any Law or Order applicable to any NCC Company or any of
their respective Assets.

  



  

(c) Other than (i) in connection or compliance with the provisions of the
Securities Laws, applicable state corporate and securities Laws, and rules and
requirements of Nasdaq, (ii) Consents required from Regulatory Authorities,
(iii) notices to or filings with the Internal Revenue Service or the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to any employee benefit plans, (iv)
notices to or filings with Nasdaq regarding the listing on Nasdaq of the
shares of NCC Common Stock to be issued in the Merger and (v) Consents,
filings or notifications that, if not obtained or made, are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
NCC, no notice to, filing with or Consent of any public body or authority is
necessary for the consummation by NCC of the Merger and the other transactions
provided for in this Agreement or for the consummation by NBC of the Bank
Merger and the other transactions provided for in the Bank Merger Agreement.
No Consents or approvals of or filings or registrations with any Regulatory
Authorities are necessary in connection with the execution and delivery by NCC
of this Agreement.

  



  

 **6.3 ** _ **Capital Stock.**_ The authorized capital stock of NCC, as
of the date of this Agreement, consists of (a) 30,000,000 shares of NCC Common
Stock and (b) 250,000 shares of NCC Preferred Stock. As of the date hereof,
17,229,256 shares of NCC Common Stock and no shares of NCC Preferred Stock are
issued and outstanding. All of the shares of NCC Common Stock to be issued in
exchange for shares of Landmark Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger,
when issued in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, will be duly and
validly issued and outstanding and fully paid and nonassessable under the
DGCL. None of the shares of NCC Common Stock to be issued in exchange for
shares of Landmark Common Stock upon consummation of the Merger will be issued
in violation of any preemptive rights of the stockholders of NCC. _ ****_

  



  

   

  



  

 **6.4 ** _ **Reports and Financial Statements.**_

  



  

(a) Since January 1, 2015, or the date of organization or acquisition if
later, each NCC Company has filed all reports and statements, together with
any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it was required
to file with (i) the SEC, including, but not limited to, Annual Reports on
Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and
proxy statements, (ii) other Regulatory Authorities, and (iii) any applicable
state securities or banking authorities. As of their respective dates, each of
such reports and documents, including the NCC Financial Statements, exhibits,
and schedules thereto, complied in all material respects with all applicable
Laws, including, without limitation, the Securities Laws. As of its respective
date, each such report and document did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The NCC Financial
Statements included in such reports (as of the dates thereof and for the
periods covered thereby) (A) are, or if dated after the date of this
Agreement, will be, in accordance with the books and records of the NCC
Companies, which are or will be, as the case may be, complete and correct and
which have been or will have been, as the case may be, maintained in
accordance with good business practices, and (B) present, or will present,
fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the NCC
Companies as of the dates indicated and the consolidated results of
operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows of the NCC
Companies for the periods indicated, in accordance with GAAP (subject to
exceptions as to consistency specified therein or as may be indicated in the
notes thereto or, in the case of interim financial statements, to normal year-
end adjustments that are not material). Porter Keadle Moore, LLC is a
registered public accounting firm and throughout the periods covered by the
financial statements filed with the SEC by NCC has been "independent" with
respect to NCC within the meaning of Regulation S-X under the 1934 Act.

  



  

(b) NCC maintains a system of internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act) sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Since December 31, 2017, there has not been any material
change in the internal controls utilized by NCC to provide reasonable
assurance that its consolidated financial statements conform with GAAP. NCC
maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act) to ensure that material information required
to be disclosed by NCC in the reports that it files or submits under the 1934
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to
NCC's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures and to allow NCC's management to make the certifications of the
principal executive officer and principal financial officer of NCC required
under the 1934 Act.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Each of the principal executive officer and the principal financial
officer of NCC (or each former principal executive officer and each former
principal financial officer of NCC, as applicable) has made all certifications
required by Rule 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the 1934 Act and Sections 302 and 906
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the reports of NCC filed with the
SEC, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and accurate
in all material respects. No NCC Company has outstanding (or has arranged or
modified since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) any "extensions of
credit" (within the meaning of Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) to
directors or executive officers (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange
Act) of any NCC Company, other than loans or extensions of credit permitted
by, or excluded from the prohibition of, Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act. NCC is otherwise in compliance with all applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

(d) No NCC Company is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party
to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar contract
or arrangement (including any contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among NCC and any other NCC Company, on
the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured
finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other
hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangement"), where the result, purpose or
intended effect of such contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material Liabilities of, NCC or any NCC
Company in NCC's or such other NCC Company's financial statements.

  



  

 **6.5 ** _ **Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities.**_ **** No NCC Company
has any Liabilities that are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NCC, except Liabilities (a) accrued or
reserved against in the consolidated balance sheets of NCC as of December 31,
2017, that are included in the NCC Financial Statements or reflected in the
notes thereto, (b) incurred or paid in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past business practice, or (c) incurred or paid pursuant to
and in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  



  

 **6.6 ** _ **Absence of Certain Changes or Events.**_ Since December 31,
2017: (a) there have been no events, changes or occurrences that have had, or
are reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on NCC, including, without limitation, any change in the
administrative or supervisory standing or rating of NCC with any Regulatory
Authority, and (b) the NCC Companies have not taken any action, or failed to
take any action, prior to the date of this Agreement, which action or failure,
if taken after the date of this Agreement, would represent or result in a
material breach or violation of any of the covenants and agreements of NCC
provided in Article 7 of this Agreement.

  



  

 **6.7 ** _ **Compliance with Laws.**_ NCC is duly registered as a
financial holding company under the federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,
as amended. Each NCC Company has in effect all Permits necessary for it to
own, lease or operate its Assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except for those Permits the absence of which are not reasonably
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
NCC, and there has occurred no Default under any such Permit. Each of the NCC
Companies:

  



  

(a) is and since October 31, 2010, has been in compliance in all material
respects with all Laws, Orders or Permits applicable to its business or
employees conducting its business; and

  



  

   

  



  

(b) since October 31, 2010, has received no notification or communication
from any Governmental Authority or any Regulatory Authority or the staff
thereof (i) asserting that any NCC Company is not in compliance with any of
the Laws or Orders that such Governmental Authority or Regulatory Authority
enforces, except for such matters of non-compliance, if any, that are not
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect on NCC, (ii) threatening to revoke any Permits, (iii) requiring
any NCC Company to enter into or consent to the issuance of a cease and desist
order, formal agreement, directive, commitment or memorandum of understanding,
or to adopt any board resolution or similar undertaking, or (iv) directing,
restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit in any
manner the operations of any NCC Company, including, without limitation, any
restrictions on the payment of dividends, or that in any manner relates to
such entity's capital adequacy, credit or reserve policies or management or
business.

  



  

 **6.8 ** _ **Material Contracts.**_ No NCC Company is in Default under
any of its Contracts.

  



  

 **6.9 ** _ **Legal Proceedings.**_ **** There is no Litigation instituted
or pending, or, to the Knowledge of each NCC Company, threatened (or
unasserted but considered probable of assertion) against any NCC Company, or
against any Asset, interest, or right of any of them that is reasonably likely
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NCC,
nor are there any Orders of any Governmental Authorities, Regulatory
Authorities or arbitrators outstanding, pending or, to the Knowledge of any
NCC Company, threatened against any NCC Company, that are reasonably likely to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on NCC.

  



  

 **6.10 ** _ **Statements True and Correct.**_ Neither this Agreement nor
any statement, certificate, instrument or other writing furnished or to be
furnished by any NCC Company or any Affiliate thereof to Landmark pursuant to
this Agreement, including the Exhibits or Schedules hereto, contains or will
contain any untrue statement of material fact or will omit to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. None of the information supplied
or to be supplied by any NCC Company or any Affiliate thereof for inclusion in
(a) the documents to be filed with the SEC, including, without limitation, the
S-4 Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement-Prospectus to be mailed to
the holders of Landmark Common Stock, and (b) any other documents to be filed
by any NCC Company or any Affiliate thereof with the SEC or any other
Regulatory Authority in connection with the transactions provided for herein,
will, at the respective time at which such documents are filed, and with
respect to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, when first mailed to the holders of
Landmark Common Stock, be false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. All documents that any NCC Company or any Affiliate thereof is
responsible for filing with any Regulatory Authority in connection with the
transactions provided for herein will comply as to form in all material
respects with the provisions of applicable Law.

  



  

   

  



  

 **6.11 ** _ **Tax Matters.**_ Each NCC Company has filed all material
Tax Returns that it was required to file under applicable Laws, other than Tax
Returns that are not yet due or for which a request for extension was filed
consistent with requirements of applicable Law. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 6.11_ , all such Tax Returns were correct and complete in all
material respects. All material Taxes due and owing by any NCC Company have
been paid, other than Taxes that have been reserved or accrued on the balance
sheet of NCC or that NCC is contesting in good faith. Since December 31, 2013,
no claim has been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where NCC does not
file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and
payable) upon any of the assets of any NCC Company. No NCC Company has taken
any action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably
likely to prevent the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger
and the Bank Merger, from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the IRC.

  



  

 **6.12 ** _ **Regulatory Approvals.**_ No NCC Company has taken any
action or has any Knowledge of any fact or circumstance that is reasonably
likely to materially impede or delay receipt of any Consents of Regulatory
Authorities referred to in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement or result in the
imposition of a condition or restriction of the type referred to in the last
sentence of such Section.

  



  

 **6.13 ** _ **1933 Act and 1934 Act Compliance.**_ The Proxy Statement-
Prospectus will comply in all material respects with applicable provisions of
the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that NCC makes no representation or warranty with
respect to any information provided by or on behalf of any Landmark Company
for inclusion in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus.

  



  

 **6.14 ** _ **Regulatory Capital.**_ NCC is "well capitalized" (as
defined in 12 C.F.R. Part 225.2(r)) and "well managed" (as defined in 12
C.F.R. Part 225.2(s)). NBC is an "eligible bank" (as defined in 12 C.F.R. Part
5.3(g)).

  



  

 **6.15 ** _ **Opinion of Counsel.**_ NCC has no Knowledge of any facts
that would preclude issuance of the opinion of counsel referred to in Section
9.1(e).

  



  

 **6.16 **_**Financial Advisor.**_ **** NCC has engaged Stephens Inc.
(the " **NCC Financial Advisor** ") to act as financial advisor to NCC in
connection with the Merger, pursuant to which the NCC Financial Advisor
agreed, upon request by NCC, to render an opinion to the NCC Board as to the
fairness, from a financial point of view, to NCC of the consideration to be
offered in the transaction. The NCC Board has received the opinion (which, if
initially rendered verbally, has been or will be confirmed by a written
opinion, dated the same date) of the NCC Financial Advisor to the effect that,
as of the date of such opinion, and based upon and subject to the factors,
assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the aggregate Per Share Merger
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to NCC.

that in the good faith judgment of the Landmark Board is, or is reasonably
likely to lead to the delivery of, a Superior Proposal, and (B) the Landmark
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel,
that failure to participate in discussions with such Person concerning such
Acquisition Proposal would likely result in a violation of its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then Landmark may (x) furnish information
(including non-public information) with respect to Landmark to any such Person
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement containing confidentiality provisions

be initiated or continued with, Landmark, its Subsidiaries, or their officers,
directors, employees, representatives or agents. The notice shall indicate the
name of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal or taking such action and
the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers, and thereafter

negotiations. Landmark also agrees that it will promptly request each Person
that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
any Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential information
heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of it or any of its
Subsidiaries.

interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the Parties).

as a consequence. In the event of any claim or Litigation that may give rise
to indemnity obligations on the part of NCC (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), (i) NCC shall have the right to assume the defense
thereof, and NCC shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that, if NCC
elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party advises
that there are substantive issues that raise conflicts of interest between NCC
and the Indemnified Party under the rules of professional ethics, the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to him or her, and NCC shall
pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that NCC shall be obligated to pay for only
one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction; (ii) all
Indemnified Parties will reasonably cooperate in the defense of any such
Litigation; and (iii) NCC shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior written consent; and _provided_ _further_ , that NCC shall
not have any obligation hereunder to the extent such arrangements are
prohibited by applicable Law.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, NCC will
use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide director's and officer's
liability insurance (" **D andO Insurance**") that serves to reimburse the
present and former officers and directors of Landmark or its Subsidiaries
(determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events occurring before the
Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated hereby), which
insurance will contain at least the same coverage and amounts, and contain
terms and conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Party, as the
coverage currently provided by Landmark as of the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if NCC is unable to maintain or obtain the
insurance called for by this Section 8.13(c), then NCC will provide as much
comparable insurance as is reasonably available, (ii) officers and directors
of Landmark or its Subsidiaries may be required to make application and
provide customary representations and warranties to the carrier of the DandO
Insurance for the purpose of obtaining such insurance, and (iii) in
satisfaction of its obligations under this Section 8.13(c), NCC may require
Landmark to purchase, prior to but effective as of the Effective Time, tail
insurance providing such coverage prior to Closing. Whether or not NCC or
Landmark shall procure such coverage, in no event shall Landmark expend, or
shall NCC be required to expend, for such tail insurance a premium amount in
excess of $160,000 (the " **Maximum D andO Tail Premium**"). If the cost of such
tail insurance exceeds the Maximum DandO Tail Premium, then Landmark or NCC, as
applicable, shall obtain tail insurance coverage or a separate tail insurance
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the
Maximum DandO Tail Premium.

  



  

(d) If NCC or any of its successors and assigns (i) shall consolidate with
or merge into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
shall transfer all or substantially all of its property and Assets to any
individual, corporation or other entity, then, in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of NCC and its
Subsidiaries shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 8.13. The
provisions of this Section 8.13 shall survive the Effective Time and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

  



  

 **8.14 ** _ **System Integration.**_ From and after the date hereof,
subject to applicable Law and regulation, Landmark shall, and shall cause its
directors, officers and employees to, and shall make all commercially
reasonable efforts (without undue disruption to either business) to cause
First Landmark Bank's data processing consultants and software providers to,
cooperate and assist First Landmark Bank and NBC in connection with an
electronic and systematic conversion of all applicable data of First Landmark
Bank to the NBC system following the Effective Time, including the training of
First Landmark Bank employees during normal business hours without undue
disruption to First Landmark Bank's business.

  



  

 **8.15 ** _ **Coordination; Integration.**_ Subject to applicable Law
and regulation, during the period from the date hereof until the Effective
Time, Landmark shall cause the Chief Executive Officer of First Landmark Bank
or, if such Person is unavailable, another senior officer thereof, to assist
and confer with the officers of NBC, on a weekly basis, relating to the
development, coordination and implementation of the post-Bank Merger operating
and integration plans of NBC, as the resulting association in the Bank Merger.
Notwithstanding the conversion of the core processing and other data
processing and information systems of First Landmark Bank in conjunction with
the Bank Merger, and subject to applicable provisions of Law and non-objection
from any Regulatory Authorities, it is the Parties' intent that, following the
Bank Merger, the former main office and branches of First Landmark Bank, along
with any branches of NBC in the same market area and under common day-to-day
management with the former branches of First Landmark Bank, will operate and
conduct business under the trade name "First Landmark Bank, a division of
National Bank of Commerce" for at least two (2) years following the Effective
Time (along with signage, stationery and marketing materials in such name).

  



  

   

  



  

 **8.16 ** _ **Non-Competition Agreements.**_ Landmark shall cause each
non-employee director of Landmark to execute and deliver to NCC a Non-
Competition Agreement concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and effective upon (and subject to the occurrence of) the Effective
Time.

  



  

 **8.17 ** _ **Claims Letters.**_ Landmark shall cause each director and
executive officer of Landmark to execute and deliver a release of claims (a "
**Claims Letter** ") concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and effective upon (and subject to the occurrence of) the Effective
Time. _ ****_

  



  

 **8.18 ** _ **Employment Agreements.**_

  



  

(a) As of the date of this Agreement, NCC has entered into agreements that
terminate, effective immediately prior to (and subject to the occurrence of)
the Effective Time, the employment, consulting, severance, change in control,
or similar agreements or arrangements with the individuals set forth on
_Schedule 8.18(a)_ (collectively, the " **Employment Agreement Termination
Letters** "). The foregoing terminations shall be for payment amounts not to
exceed those set forth on _Schedule 8.18(a)_.

  



  

(b) As of the date of this Agreement, NBC (as successor to First Landmark
Bank) has entered into employment and non-competition agreements that become
effective as of (and subject to the occurrence of) the Effective Time with the
individuals set forth on _Schedule 8.18(b)_ (the " **Employment Agreements**
").

  



  

 **8.19 ** _ **Section 280G Matters.**_ Prior to the Closing, NCC and
Landmark will work together in good faith to implement mutually satisfactory
arrangements such that the Merger will not trigger or result in any payment,
including, without limitation, any "excess parachute payment" as defined in
Section 280G of the IRC, that could be disallowed as a deduction or result in
the payment of excise taxes under Section 280G of the IRC.

  



  

   

  



  

 **8.20 ** _ **Employee Matters.**_

  



  

(a) Following the Effective Time, NCC shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of employees (as a group) who are full-time active employees of
Landmark and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (" **Covered Employees** ")
that provide employee benefits and compensation opportunities that, in the
aggregate, are substantially comparable to the employee benefits and
compensation opportunities that are made available on a uniform and non-
discriminatory basis to similarly situated employees of NCC or its
Subsidiaries, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
any Covered Employee be eligible to participate in any closed or frozen plan
of NCC or its Subsidiaries. Subject to applicable Law and the terms and
conditions of NCC's benefit plans and the requirements of the insurers
thereunder, NCC shall give the Covered Employees full credit for their prior
service with the Landmark Companies (i) for purposes of eligibility (including
initial participation and eligibility for current benefits) and vesting under
any qualified or non-qualified employee benefit plan maintained by NCC and in
which Covered Employees may be eligible to participate and (ii) for all
purposes under any welfare benefit plans, severance plans, vacation plans and
similar arrangements maintained by NCC (which shall not include, for the sake
of clarity, duplication of any severance obligations under Section 8.20(e)).
Each Covered Employee's accrued paid time off and unused sick time will be
credited towards one or a combination of NCC's welfare benefit plans.

  



  

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plan of NCC that is a health,
dental, vision or other welfare plan in which any Covered Employee is eligible
to participate, for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate, NCC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cause any pre-existing condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods
under such NCC plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the
extent that such condition was or would have been covered under the Landmark
Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) recognize and provide credit for any health,
dental, vision or other welfare expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in
the coverage period that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the coverage
period in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) for
purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such health, dental, vision or other welfare plan.

  



  

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Landmark shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, take all actions requested by NCC that may be necessary or
appropriate to (i) cause one or more Landmark Benefits Plans to terminate as
of the Effective Time, or as of the date immediately preceding the Effective
Time, (ii) cause benefit accruals and entitlements under any Landmark Benefit
Plan to cease as of the Effective Time, or as of the date immediately
preceding the Effective Time, (iii) cause the continuation on and after the
Effective Time of any contract, arrangement or insurance policy relating to
any Landmark Benefit Plan for such period as may be requested by NCC, or (iv)
facilitate the merger of any Landmark Benefit Plan into any employee benefit
plan maintained by NCC or an NCC Subsidiary. Prior to the Effective Time,
Landmark shall provide NCC with a list of all employees eligible for COBRA
Coverage under any Landmark Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan," as of
the date immediately preceding the Effective Time. All resolutions, notices,
or other documents issued, adopted or executed in connection with the
implementation of this Section 8.20(c) shall be subject to NCC's reasonable
prior review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

  



  

(d) Nothing in this Section 8.20 shall be construed to limit the right of
NCC or any of its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any Landmark Benefit Plan
that is assumed by any NCC Company at or subsequent to the Effective Time, or
other employee benefit plan, to the extent that such amendment or termination
is permitted by the terms of the applicable plan and applicable Law, nor shall
anything in this Section 8.20 be construed to require NCC or any of its
Subsidiaries to retain the employment of any particular Covered Employee for
any fixed period of time following the Closing Date, and the continued
retention (or termination) by NCC or any of its Subsidiaries of any Covered
Employee subsequent to the Effective Time shall be subject in all events to
NCC's or its applicable Subsidiary's normal and customary employment
procedures and practices, including customary background screening and
evaluation procedures and satisfactory employment performance.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) If, within nine (9) months after the Effective Time, any Covered
Employee becomes a Landmark Terminated Employee, then NCC will pay severance
to such Landmark Terminated Employee in an amount equal to two (2) weeks' pay
for each twelve (12) months of such Landmark Terminated Employee's prior
employment with a Landmark Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
will the total amount of severance payable to any single Landmark Terminated
Employee exceed the lesser of $50,000 or an amount equal to 26 weeks' pay in
the aggregate. Any severance to which a Covered Employee may be entitled in
connection with a termination occurring more than nine (9) months after the
Effective Time will be as set forth in the severance policies of NCC and its
Subsidiaries as then in effect. For the sake of clarity, this Section 8.20(e)
does not apply to or benefit any Covered Employee who is a party to an
Employment Agreement or any change in control or severance agreement; rather,
the terms and conditions of such Employment Agreement, change in control
agreement or severance agreement, as applicable, shall govern and control upon
any termination of employment.

  



  

(f) At the Effective Time, NCC shall assume (i) the Supplemental Executive
Retirement Benefits Agreement for the benefit of R. Stanley Kryder, dated
January 1, 2014, and the related Split-Dollar Agreement dated January 1, 2014,
and (ii) the Agreement for the benefit of Terrence Y. Dewitt, dated August 23,
2012, and NCC shall subsequently perform First Landmark Bank's obligations
thereunder in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of
such agreements. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to execute and
deliver any documents deemed necessary by the Parties, in consultation with
counsel, to effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Section 8.20(f).

  



  

(g) Notwithstanding Section 7.2(g), prior to the Effective Time, Landmark
may, in consultation with NCC, amend the outstanding option agreements under
the Landmark Equity Incentive Plans for the sole purpose of providing for a
broker-assisted cashless exercise as an available mechanism for the exercise
of options granted under such option agreements.

  



  

 **8.21 ** _ **Subordinated Debentures Issued to NBC.**_ The Parties
acknowledge that NBC currently holds $250,000 in aggregate principal amount of
the Subordinated Debentures (the " **NBC Tranche** "). In advance of the
Closing, at the election of NCC, (a) NBC will sell the NBC Tranche to a third
party in a private transaction, in accordance with and pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the Subordinated Note representing the NBC Tranche, or (b)
Landmark will purchase the NBC Tranche pursuant to Section 4(g) of the
Subordinated Note representing the NBC Tranche at a purchase price equal to
100% of the outstanding principal amount of the NBC Tranche, plus accrued but
unpaid interest as of the date of the purchase, and subsequently cause the NBC
Tranche to be cancelled. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to execute,
deliver and obtain any documents or Consents deemed necessary by the Parties,
in consultation with counsel, to effectuate either the purchase by Landmark or
the sale by NBC, as elected by NCC.

  



  

   

  



  

 **8.22 ** _ **Assumption of Indebtedness.**_

  



  

(a) _Subordinated Debentures_. Subject to Section 8.21, as of the
Effective Time and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, NCC shall

covenants, agreements and obligations under and relating to the Subordinated
Debentures, including the due and punctual payment of the principal of and any
premium and interest on the Subordinated Debentures according to their terms,
and the due and punctual performance of all covenants and conditions relating
to the Subordinated Debentures to be performed or observed by Landmark. As of
the Effective Time, the Subordinated Debentures shall rank _pari passu_ to
NCC's other subordinated debt obligations issued and outstanding from time to
time. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to execute, deliver and obtain
any documents or Consents deemed necessary by the Parties, in consultation
with counsel, to effectuate the assumption in accordance with the requirements
of the Subordinated Debentures and NCC's existing debt instruments, including,
but not limited to, any trustee and holder notifications or Consents that must
be delivered or obtained, as applicable, prior to or in connection with the
assumption.

  



  

(b) _Industrial Development Revenue Bonds_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Landmark shall cause the redemption in full of the Industrial Development
Revenue Bonds by First Landmark Bank. Landmark shall execute, deliver and
obtain any documents or Consents deemed necessary by Landmark, in consultation
with counsel, to effectuate the redemption in accordance with the requirements
of the Industrial Development Bonds and related letters of credit, including,
but not limited to, any trustee and holder notifications or Consents that must
be delivered or obtained, as applicable, prior to or in connection with the
redemption. In connection with the Closing, Landmark shall deliver to NCC
evidence of the redemption and cancellation of the Industrial Revenue Bonds
and related letters of credit, in such detail and form as deemed by NCC to be
satisfactory.

  



  

(c) _FHLB Advances_. As of the Effective Time, NCC shall assume all
rights and obligations of First Landmark Bank under and relating to the FHLB
Advances and shall subsequently discharge all of First Landmark Bank's

necessary by the Parties, in consultation with counsel, to effectuate the
assumption in accordance with the requirements of the FHLB Advances, including
any notifications that must be delivered to the FHLB or Consents that must be
obtained from the FHLB prior to or in connection with the assumption.

expired. No Consent obtained from any Regulatory Authority that is necessary
to consummate the transactions provided for herein shall be conditioned or
restricted in a manner (including, without limitation, requirements relating
to the raising of additional capital or the disposition of Assets) that in the
reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of either Party would so
materially adversely impact the economic or business benefits of the

consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger.

  



  

(c) _Consents and Approvals_. Each of the Parties shall have obtained any
and all Consents required for consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger
(other than those referred to in Section 9.1(b) of this Agreement) or for the

not obtained or made, is reasonably likely to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on such Party. No Consent so obtained
that is necessary to consummate the transactions provided for herein shall be
conditioned or restricted in a manner that in the reasonable judgment of the
Board of Directors of either Party would so materially adversely impact the
economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this

(d) _Legal Proceedings_. No court or Regulatory Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) or taken any other
action that prohibits, restricts or makes illegal consummation of the Merger
or the Bank Merger or any other transaction provided for in this Agreement. No
action or proceeding shall have been instituted by any Person, and the Parties
shall not have Knowledge of any threatened action or proceeding by any Person,
that seeks to restrain the consummation of the Merger, the Bank Merger or any
other transaction provided for in this Agreement that, in the opinion of the
NCC Board or the Landmark Board, renders it impossible or inadvisable to
consummate the transactions provided for in this Agreement.

  



  

(e) _Tax Opinion_. Landmark and NCC shall have received a written opinion
of counsel from Maynard, Cooper and Gale, P.C. in form reasonably satisfactory
to them (the " **Tax Opinion** "), to the effect that (i) the Merger will
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC,
(ii) the exchange in the Merger of Landmark Common Stock for NCC Common Stock
will not give rise to gain or loss to the stockholders of Landmark with
respect to such exchange (except to the extent of any cash received), and

the Merger (except for income and deferred gain recognized pursuant to

such counsel.

NCC shall have either, as applicable, (i) caused the shares of NCC Common
Stock issuable to holders of Landmark Common Stock upon consummation of the

notify Nasdaq of the issuance of the shares of NCC Common Stock in the Merger
within the requisite time period after the Closing Date.

of Landmark set forth or referred to in this Agreement or in any certificate
or document delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof that are qualified as
to materiality or Material Adverse Effect (other than those set forth in

though all such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the
Effective Time (provided that representations and warranties that are confined
to a specified date shall speak only as of such date), and the representations
and warranties of Landmark set forth or referred to in this Agreement or in
any certificate or document delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof that
are not so qualified shall be true and correct in all material respects as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time with the same effect
as though all such representations and warranties had been made on and as of

confined to a specified date shall speak only as of such date). The
representations and warranties of Landmark set forth in Sections 5.10(c) and
(d) shall be true and correct in all respects as of the date of this Agreement
and (without giving effect to any limitation indicated by the words "in all
material respects") as of the Effective Time with the same effect as though
all such representations and warranties had been made on and as of the
Effective Time, except where the failure of such representations and
warranties to be true and correct as of the Effective Time would not have, and
would not be reasonably likely to have, in the aggregate a Material Adverse
Effect on Landmark. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and
warranties of Landmark set forth in Section 5.3 (Capitalization) and the
second sentence of Section 5.5(b) (Landmark Subsidiaries) shall be true and
correct in all respects, except for such failures to be true and correct as

reasonable detail as NCC and its counsel shall request.

(g) _Matters Relating to 280G Taxes_. NCC shall be satisfied in its
reasonable discretion, either through mutually agreeable pre-Closing
amendments or otherwise, that Landmark shall have taken any and all reasonably
necessary steps such that neither the Merger nor the Bank Merger will trigger

Plans, supplemental compensation, retirement or similar arrangements between a
Landmark Company and any officers, directors or employees thereof.

(j) _Absence of Adverse Facts_. There shall have been no determination by
NCC in good faith that any fact, Litigation, claim, event or condition exists
or has occurred that, in the judgment of NCC, (i) would have a Material
Adverse Effect on, or that may be foreseen to have a Material Adverse Effect
on, Landmark or the consummation of the transactions provided for in this
Agreement, (ii) would be of such significance with respect to the business or
economic benefits expected to be obtained by NCC pursuant to this Agreement as
to render inadvisable the consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger,
(iii) would be materially adverse to the interests of NCC on a consolidated
basis, or (iv) would render the Merger or the other transactions provided for
in this Agreement impractical because of any state of war, national emergency,
banking moratorium or general suspension of trading on any national securities
exchange.

  



  

(k) _Consents Under Agreements_. Landmark shall have obtained all Consents
or _approvals_ of each Person (other than the Consents of the Regulatory
Authorities) whose consent or approval shall be required in order to permit
the succession by the Surviving Corporation to, or the continuation by a
Landmark Subsidiary of, as the case may be, any obligation, right or interest
of Landmark or such Landmark Subsidiary under any loan or credit agreement,
note, mortgage, indenture, lease, license, Contract or other agreement or
instrument, except those for which failure to obtain such Consents and
approvals would not in the reasonable opinion of NCC, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Surviving Corporation or the
Landmark Subsidiary at issue or upon consummation of the transactions provided
for in this Agreement.

  



  

(l) _Material Condition_. There shall not be any action taken, or any
statute, rule, regulation or order enacted, entered, enforced or deemed
applicable to the Merger by any Regulatory Authority that, in connection with
the grant of any Consent by any Regulatory Authority, imposes any restriction
or condition on NCC or any NCC Subsidiary, that, even if not reasonably likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect on NCC, in the opinion of NCC is materially
and unreasonably burdensome on NCC's business following the Effective Time or
that would reduce the economic benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to NCC to such a degree that NCC would not have entered into
this Agreement had such condition or restriction been known to it at the date
hereof.

  



  

(m) _Loan Portfolio_. NCC shall have received _Schedule 5.10(a)(iv)_
updated as of the Landmark Measuring Date, and there shall not have been any
material increase since the date of this Agreement in the Loans described or
required to be described thereon; _provided_ , _however_ , that, regardless of
any such increase, the condition in this Section 9.2(m) shall be deemed to be
satisfied if the quotient of the aggregate amount of the Classified Loans of
the Landmark Companies as of the Landmark Measuring Date, divided by the sum
of (i) Landmark's equity, plus (ii) the Landmark Allowance, both as set forth
on Landmark's balance sheet on the Landmark Measuring Date, is less than 0.35.

  



  

   

  



  

(n) _Landmark Benefit Plans_. NCC shall have received such evidence and
documentation as it shall have reasonably requested to effectuate the
provisions of Section 8.20(c) regarding the Landmark Benefit Plans. NCC shall
be satisfied that the Landmark Options shall be treated in accordance with
this Agreement.

  



  

(o) _Bank Merger Agreement_. Prior to the Landmark Stockholders' Meeting,
the Bank Merger Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by First
Landmark Bank and approved by Landmark as First Landmark Bank's sole
stockholder.

  



  

(p) _Related Agreements_. None of the Voting Agreements, Non-Competition
Agreements or Claims Letters delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall have
been amended, revoked or terminated by any party thereto (other than by a non-
breaching party due to a material breach by NCC or NBC).

  



  

(q) _Legal Proceedings_. No action, proceeding or claim shall have been
instituted by any Person, and the Parties shall not have Knowledge of any
threatened action, claim or proceeding by any Person, against any Landmark
Company and/or their respective officers or directors that would result in a
Material Adverse Effect on such Landmark Company.

abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time:

  



  

(a) by mutual written consent of the NCC Board and the Landmark Board; or

  



  

(b) by the NCC Board or the Landmark Board in the event of an inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that cannot be
or has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the
breaching Party of such inaccuracy and which inaccuracy is reasonably likely,
in the opinion of the non-breaching Party, to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the breaching Party; or

  



  

(c) by the NCC Board or the Landmark Board in the event of a material
breach by the other Party of any covenant, agreement or other obligation
contained in this Agreement that cannot be or has not been cured within 30
days after the giving of written notice to the breaching Party of such breach;
or

  



  

   

  



  

(d) by the NCC Board or the Landmark Board (provided that the terminating
Party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or other obligation contained in this Agreement) if (i)
any Consent of any Regulatory Authority required for consummation of the
Merger, the Bank Merger or the other transactions provided for herein shall
have been denied by final non-appealable action of such authority or if any
action taken by such Regulatory Authority is not appealed within the time

approval of this Agreement and the transactions provided for herein as
required by applicable Law at the Landmark Stockholders' Meeting where the

attached hereto or otherwise, (i) there shall have occurred any Material
Adverse Effect with respect to Landmark, or (ii) any facts or circumstances
shall develop or arise after the date of this Agreement that are reasonably
likely to cause or result in any Material Adverse Effect with respect to
Landmark, and such Material Adverse Effect (or such facts or circumstances)
shall not have been remedied within fifteen (15) days after receipt by
Landmark of notice in writing from NCC specifying the nature of such Material
Adverse Effect and requesting that it be remedied; or

  



  

(f) by the Landmark Board if, notwithstanding any disclosures in the
Schedules attached hereto or otherwise, (i) there shall have occurred any
Material Adverse Effect with respect to NCC, or (ii) any facts or
circumstances shall develop or arise after the date of this Agreement that are
reasonably likely to cause or result in any Material Adverse Effect with
respect to NCC, and such Material Adverse Effect (or such facts or
circumstances) shall not have been remedied within fifteen (15) days after
receipt by NCC of notice in writing from Landmark specifying the nature of
such Material Adverse Effect and requesting that it be remedied; or

  



  

(g) by the NCC Board or the Landmark Board if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before 270 days following the date of this Agreement,
if the failure to consummate the transactions provided for herein on or before
such date is not caused by any breach of this Agreement by the Party electing
to terminate pursuant to this Section 10.1(g); or

  



  

(h) by the NCC Board or the Landmark Board if any of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of such Party to consummate the Merger cannot be

Agreement and such failure was not the fault of the terminating Party; or

  



  

(i) by the NCC Board if (i) the holders of in excess of seven and one half

assert their dissenters' rights of appraisal pursuant to applicable Law; or

have approved or recommended to the stockholders of Landmark that they approve
an Acquisition Proposal other than that contemplated by this Agreement, (iii)
Landmark fails to call the Landmark Stockholders' Meeting or otherwise
breaches its obligations in Section 8.4 hereof, or (iv) any Person (other than
Landmark or an Affiliate of Landmark) or group becomes the beneficial owner of
50% or more of the outstanding shares of Landmark Common Stock; or

  



  

   

  



  

(k) by the Landmark Board if it concludes in good faith that an
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (after consultation
with outside legal counsel) that failure to terminate this Agreement to enter
into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal would
likely result in a violation of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Landmark Board may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(k) unless and until (i) Landmark shall
have complied with the terms of this Agreement; (ii) the Landmark Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
such Superior Proposal has been made and has not been withdrawn and continues
to be a Superior Proposal after taking into account all adjustments to the
terms of this Agreement that may be offered by NCC under this Section 10.1(k);
(iii) the Landmark Board has given NCC at least three (3) Business Days' prior
written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (which notice
shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal,
including the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal) and has
contemporaneously provided to NCC an unredacted copy of the relevant proposed
transaction agreements with the Person making such Superior Proposal; and (iv)
Landmark has negotiated, and has caused its representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with NCC during such notice period (to the extent that NCC wishes
to negotiate) to enable NCC to revise the terms of this Agreement such that it
would cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal. In the event of any material change to the terms of such Superior
Proposal, Landmark shall, in each case, be required to deliver to NCC a new
written notice, the notice period shall recommence, and Landmark shall be
required to comply with its obligations under this Section 10.1(k) with
respect to such new written notice. Any termination under this Section 10.1(k)
shall be subject to NCC's receipt of the Termination Fee as set forth in
Section 10.2(b), and if such amount is not received by NCC in accordance
therewith, any purported termination pursuant to this Section 10.1(k) shall be
null and void. Landmark agrees (x) that it will not enter into a definitive
agreement with respect to any Superior Proposal until at least the fifth (5th)
Business Day after it has provided the notice to NCC required hereby, and (y)
to notify NCC promptly in writing if its intention to enter into a definitive
agreement as referred to in its notification shall change at any time after
giving such notification; or

  



  

(l) by the Landmark Board if both of the following conditions are
satisfied:

  



  

(i) the Average Quoted Price is less than $36.00 (calculated as 80% of
the Starting Price); and

  



  

(ii) the quotient obtained by dividing the Average Quoted Price by the
Starting Price is less than 80% of the quotient obtained by dividing the
Average Index Price on the Determination Date by $4,084.12 (calculated as the
Average Index Price on the Nasdaq trading day prior to the effective date of
this Agreement).

  



  

   

  



  

If the Landmark Board elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written notice thereof to
NCC at any time during the two (2) Business Day period commencing on the
Business Day following the Determination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that
such notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the
aforementioned two (2) Business Day period. During the two (2) Business Day
period commencing on the Business Day following the day on which NCC receives
such notice, NCC shall have the option, but not the obligation, to increase
the consideration to be paid for each share of Landmark Common Stock by making
a cash payment (as part of the Merger consideration in addition to, and not in
lieu of, the Per Share Exchange Ratio and the Per Share Cash Consideration)
for each share of Landmark Common Stock (the " **Additional Cash Payment Per
Share** ") in an amount (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the product of
(x) the Per Share Exchange Ratio and (y) the difference between (i) $36.00
(calculated as 80% of the Starting Price) and (ii) the Average Quoted Price;
_provided_ , _however_ , that NCC shall not be permitted to elect to make the
Additional Cash Payment Per Share if making such cash payments would preclude
issuance of the opinion of counsel referred to in Section 9.1(e).

  



  

If NCC makes this election within such two (2) Business Day period, it shall
give prompt written notice to Landmark of such election, whereupon no
termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 10.1(l), and this
Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms. If the Closing
Date would naturally occur during NCC's two (2) Business Day option period
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Closing Date shall be extended
until a date selected by NCC no more than ten (10) Business Days following the
close of such two-day period (unless NCC does not exercise its option and the
Agreement is thereby terminated).

  



  

Each Party and its respective Subsidiaries shall not, and shall use their best
efforts to ensure that their respective executive officers, directors, and
stockholders who may be deemed an "affiliate" (as defined in SEC Rules 145 and
405) of such Party do not, purchase or sell on Nasdaq, or submit a bid to
purchase or an offer to sell on Nasdaq, directly or indirectly, any shares of
NCC Common Stock or any options, rights or other securities convertible into
shares of NCC Common Stock during the determination period for the Average
Quoted Price.

reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to the number of shares of NCC Common Stock outstanding after the date

 **10.2 ** _ **Effect of Termination.**_

  



  

(a) In the event of a termination of this Agreement by either the NCC
Board or the Landmark Board as provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall
become void and there shall be no Liability or obligation on the part of NCC
or Landmark or their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or
directors of any of them, except that this Section 10.2 and Article 11 and
Sections 8.2 (Access to Information) and 8.7 (Expenses) of this Agreement
shall survive any such termination; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
herein shall relieve any breaching Party from Liability for an uncured willful

rise to such termination.

or NCC has grounds to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(j),
then Landmark shall, in the case of clause (i), two (2) Business Days after
the date of such termination or, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), on the
date of such termination, pay to NCC, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the amount of $4,000,000 (the " **Termination Fee** ").

  



  

(c) In the event that (i) after the date of this Agreement, an Acquisition
Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or any Person shall have publicly
disclosed that, subject to the Merger being disapproved by Landmark
stockholders or otherwise rejected, it will make an Acquisition Proposal with
respect to Landmark, and thereafter this Agreement is terminated by the NCC
Board or the Landmark Board pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii), and (ii)
concurrently with such termination or within nine (9) months of such
termination Landmark enters into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Acquisition Proposal or consummates such Acquisition Proposal, then Landmark
shall, upon the earlier of entering into a definitive agreement with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal or consummating an Acquisition Proposal, pay to
NCC, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Termination Fee.

  



  

(d) Landmark acknowledges that the agreements contained in Sections
10.2(b) and 10.2(c) are an integral part of the transactions provided for in
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, NCC would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if Landmark fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to Section 10.2(b) or Section 10.2(c), as the case may be, and, in
order to obtain such payment, NCC commences a suit which results in a judgment
for any of the Termination Fee, Landmark shall pay NCC its costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit.

respective representations, warranties, obligations, covenants and agreements
of the Parties shall not survive the Effective Time, except for those

and Section 6.15, each of the Parties represents and warrants that neither it
nor any of its officers, directors, employees or Affiliates has employed any
broker or finder or incurred any Liability for any financial advisory fees,
investment bankers' fees, brokerage fees, commissions or finders' fees in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions provided for herein. In the
event of a claim by any broker or finder based upon his or its representing or
being retained by or allegedly representing or being retained by Landmark or
NCC, each of Landmark and NCC, as the case may be, agrees to indemnify and
hold the other Party harmless of and from any Liability with respect to any
such claim.

  



  

 **11.8 ** _ **Governing Law; Jury Waiver.**_ This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
without regard to any applicable conflicts of Laws, except to the extent that
federal Law shall be applicable. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE
TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT THAT SUCH PARTY
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT:
(I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS SECTION 11.8.

  



  

 **11.9 ** _ **Counterparts.**_ This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same document with the same force
and effect as though all Parties had executed the same document. The exchange
of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by e-mail or similar
electronic means shall constitute effective execution and delivery of this
Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement
for all purposes. Transmission of executed counterparts by e-mail or similar
electronic means shall have the same effect as physical delivery of manually
signed originals.

  



  

   

  



  

 **11.10 ** _ **Captions.**_ The captions as to contents of particular
articles, sections or paragraphs contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and are not part of this Agreement.

  



  

 **11.11 ** _ **Enforcement of Agreement.**_ The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any court of
the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. In any
dispute or action between the Parties arising out of this Agreement, including
any Litigation, arbitration, and appellate proceedings (and efforts to enforce
the judgment, award or other disposition of any of the same), the prevailing
Party shall be entitled to have and recover from the other Party all
reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with such dispute
or action (including reasonable attorneys' fees).

  



  

 **11.12 ** _ **Severability.**_ Any term or provision of this Agreement
that is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
enforceable.

  



  

 **11.13 ** _ **Construction of Terms.**_ Where the context so requires
or permits, use of the singular form includes the plural, and the use of the
plural form includes the singular, and the use of any gender includes any and
all genders. Accounting terms used and not otherwise defined in this Agreement
have the meanings determined by, and all calculations with respect to
accounting or financial matters unless otherwise provided for herein shall be
computed in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied. References herein to articles, sections, paragraphs,
subparagraphs or the like shall refer to the corresponding articles, sections,
paragraphs, subparagraphs or the like of this Agreement. The words "hereof,"
"herein," and terms of similar import shall refer to this entire Agreement.
Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the use of the terms
"including," "included," "such as," or terms of similar meaning, shall not be
construed to imply the exclusion of any other particular elements.

  



  

 **11.14 ** _ **Exhibits and Schedules.**_ Each of the Exhibits and
Schedules attached hereto is an integral part of this Agreement and shall be
applicable as if set forth in full at the point in the Agreement where
reference to it is made. The disclosures in the Schedules to this Agreement
relate only to the representations and warranties in the Section of the
Agreement to which they expressly relate and not to any other representation
or warranty in this Agreement. In the event of any inconsistency between the
covenants or statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the
Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the
Schedules with respect to a specifically identified representation or
warranty), the covenants and statements in the body of this Agreement will
control.

  



  

   

  



  

 **11.15 ** _ **No Third Party Beneficiaries.**_ Except for, (a) if the
Effective Time occurs, Section 8.13, which is intended to benefit each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives, (b) if the
Effective Time occurs, the right of the holders of Landmark Common Stock to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement,
and, (c) if the Effective Time occurs, the right of the Landmark Designee to
the benefits set forth in Section 2.2, nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the Parties or
their respective successors, any right, remedies, obligations or Liabilities
under or by reason of this Agreement, except as expressly contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

 **11.16 ** _ **Alternative Structure.**_ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, at any time prior to or following the
Effective Time, NCC shall be entitled to revise the structure of the Bank
Merger in order to substitute a different NCC Subsidiary (or no NCC
Subsidiary) in the place of NBC, whereby First Landmark Bank or such other NCC
Subsidiary would be the surviving bank upon consummation of the Bank Merger,
or whereby the Bank Merger would be abandoned, provided in any case that each
of the transactions comprising such revised structure shall (a) fully qualify
as, or fully be treated as part of, one or more tax free reorganizations
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the IRC, (b) be capable of
consummation in as timely a manner as the Bank Merger provided for herein, and
(c) not otherwise be prejudicial to the interests of Landmark's stockholders.
This Agreement, the Bank Merger Agreement and any related documents shall be
appropriately amended in order to reflect any such revised structure.
