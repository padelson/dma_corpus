 **Section 2.9** **Purchase Price Adjustment**. Following the Closing, the

" _Closing Working Capital Calculation_"), (ii) the Closing Indebtedness,
(iii) the Closing Transaction Expenses, and (iv) a recalculation of the
Purchase Price, if any, based on each of the foregoing. The Closing Statement
will be calculated (x) pursuant to the definitions within this Agreement, (y)
in accordance with the Accounting Principles and (z) without giving effect to
the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) _Examination and Review_.

 



 

(i) _Examination_. After receipt of the Closing Statement, Seller shall have
forty-five (45) days (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the Closing
Statement. During the Review

 



     

 

 



 

Period, Seller and its attorneys and accountants shall have access to the
books and records of the Business, the personnel of, and work papers prepared
by, Buyer and/or Buyers accountants to the extent that they relate to the
Closing Statement and to such historical financial information (to the extent
in Buyers possession) relating to the Closing Statement as Seller may
reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Closing Statement and to
prepare a Statement of Objections (as defined below), provided, that such
access shall be in a manner that does not interfere with the normal business
operations of Buyer or the Business.

 



 

(ii) _Objection_. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period, Seller may
object to the Closing Statement by delivering to Buyer a written statement
setting forth Sellers objections in reasonable detail, indicating each
disputed item, its amount and the basis for Sellers disagreement therewith
(the " _Statement of Objections_ "). If Seller fails to deliver the Statement
of Objections before the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing
Statement and the calculations contained therein shall be deemed to have been
accepted by and to be final and binding on Seller and Buyer. If Seller
delivers the Statement of Objections before the expiration of the Review
Period, Buyer and Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
objections within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the Statement of
Objections (the " _Resolution Period_ "), and, if the same are so resolved
within the Resolution Period, the Closing Statement and the calculations
contained therein, in each case with such changes as may have been previously
agreed in writing by Buyer and Seller, shall be final and binding on Seller
and Buyer and shall not be subject to further review.

 



 

(iii) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Seller and Buyer fail to reach an agreement
with respect to any or all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections before expiration of the Resolution Period, then any amounts
remaining in dispute (" _Disputed Amounts_ ") shall be submitted for
resolution to an impartial regionally recognized financial consulting firm or
a firm of independent certified public accountants other than Sellers
accountants, the Business accountants or Buyers accountants mutually
agreeable to Buyer and Seller (the " _Independent Accountant_ ") who, acting
as an expert and not an arbitrator, shall resolve the Disputed Amounts only
and make any adjustments to the Closing Statement. The Independent Accountant
shall be jointly instructed by the Parties to make a determination as soon as
practicable within thirty (30) days (or such other time as the Parties hereto
shall agree in writing) after its engagement, and its resolution of the
Disputed Amounts and, other than with respect to conclusions of Law and
interpretation of this Agreement, its adjustments to the Closing Statement
shall be enforceable as an arbitration of any claims hereunder, conclusive and
binding upon the Parties hereto absent manifest error and shall not be subject
to further review under the dispute resolution provisions of **ARTICLE VIII**
or otherwise. The Independent Accountant shall only decide the specific items
under dispute by the Parties and its decision for each Disputed Amount must be
within the

 



     

 

 



 

range of values assigned to each such item in the Closing Statement and the
Statement of Objections, respectively. The fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant shall initially be split 50/50 between Buyer and
Seller, and after the final resolution of any dispute, shall be borne by
Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based on the percentage
which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to
the amount actually contested by such party (and the appropriate party shall
reimburse the other party accordingly). For example, if closing accounts
receivable is the only disputed item, and Seller claims that closing accounts
receivable is $1,000, and Buyer contests only $500 of the amount claimed by
Seller, and if the Independent Accountants ultimately resolve the dispute by
awarding Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of
Independent Accountants will be allocated 60% ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to Buyer
and 40% ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to Seller.

 



 

(c) _Adjustment Payments_. Upon the determination, in accordance with this
_Section 2.9_, of the Closing Working Capital, the Closing Indebtedness, and
the Closing Transaction Expenses, the Purchase Price shall be recalculated
using such finally determined amounts in lieu of the estimates of such amounts
used in the calculation of the Purchase Price payable at Closing.

 



 

(i) With respect to Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness and Closing
Transaction Expenses, the Purchase Price shall be increased (in the case of an
aggregate positive amount) or decreased (in the case of an aggregate negative
amount) on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the aggregate amount, if any,
determined by subtracting each of (A) the Estimated Closing Working Capital
from the Closing Working Capital, (B) the Closing Indebtedness from the
Estimated Closing Indebtedness, and (C) the Closing Transaction Expenses from
the Estimated Transaction Expenses, and adding together the amounts calculated
in each of the foregoing (A), (B), and (C) to reach a final net amount owing
under this _Section 2.9_ (such net amount, the " _Adjustment Amount_ ").

 



 

(ii) No later than within two (2) Business Days after the determination of the
Adjustment Amount, (A) if the Adjustment Amount results in an increase to the
Purchase Price, (1) Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent
to release the Adjustment Escrow Amount (including any interest accrued
thereon) to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated by Seller and (2) Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal
to the positive difference between the Adjustment Amount and the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, (B) if the Adjustment Amount results in a decrease to the
Purchase Price, Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
release to Buyer an amount equal to the Adjustment Amount by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by Seller, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (x) if the Adjustment Amount payable pursuant to clause (B)

 



     

 

 



 

of this _Section 2.9(c)(ii)_ exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount, Seller
shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to the difference between such Adjustment
Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and (y) if the Adjustment Amount
payable pursuant to clause (B) of this _Section 2.9(c)(ii)_ is less than the
Adjustment Escrow Amount, Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow
Agent to release to Seller the remaining amount in the Escrow Account (after
giving effect to the disbursement of the Adjustment Amount to Buyer)
(including any interest accrued thereon) by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account designated by Seller, and (C) if the Adjustment
Amount is zero, Buyer and Seller shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to
release to Seller the Adjustment Escrow Amount (including any interest accrued
thereon) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated by Seller.

 



 

(d) _Miscellaneous_. Any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.9_ shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or
accounts as is directed in writing by Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, and
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the Parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

 **Section 2.10** **Allocation of Purchase Price**. Seller and Buyer agree to
file their respective IRS Forms 8594 and all federal, state and local Tax
Returns in accordance with the allocation principles set forth on _Schedule
2.10_.

 



 

 **Section 2.11** **Non-assignable Assets**.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject to
the provisions of this _Section 2.11_, to the extent that the sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery, to Buyer of any Purchased Asset would result
in a violation of applicable Law, or would require the consent, authorization,
approval or waiver of a Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an
Affiliate of a party to this Agreement (including any Governmental Authority),
and such consent, authorization, approval or waiver shall not have been
obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or an attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof; _provided, however_ ,
that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained in
**ARTICLE VII**, the Closing shall occur notwithstanding the foregoing
without any adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof. Following the
Closing, Seller and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall
cooperate with each other, to obtain any such required consent, authorization
or approval (or waiver of such requirement) for the valid sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of the Purchased Assets which are subject to
the provisions of this _Section 2.11_ to Buyer; _provided, however_ , that
neither Seller nor Buyer shall be required to pay any

 



      

 

 



 

consideration therefor. Once such consent, authorization, approval or waiver
is obtained, Seller shall be deemed to have sold, assigned, transferred,
conveyed and delivered to Buyer the relevant Purchased Asset to which such
consent, authorization, approval or waiver relates for no additional
consideration hereunder. Applicable sales, transfer and other similar Taxes in
connection with such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or license shall
be paid in accordance with _Section 6.9_.

 



 

(b) To the extent that any Purchased Asset and/or Assumed Liability cannot be
transferred to Buyer following the Closing pursuant to this _Section 2.11_,
Buyer and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into such
arrangements (such as subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting) to provide
to the Parties the economic and, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
operational equivalent of the transfer of such Purchased Asset and/or Assumed
Liability to Buyer as of the Closing and the performance by Buyer of its
obligations with respect thereto, including, without limitation, by providing
to Buyer, to the fullest extent practicable, the claims, rights and benefits
of any such Purchased Assets. In furtherance of the foregoing, to the extent
permitted under applicable Law, (i) Buyer shall, as agent or subcontractor for
Seller, pay, perform and discharge the liabilities and obligations of Seller
thereunder from and after the Closing Date, and (ii) Seller shall, at Sellers
expense, hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly upon receipt thereof,
such Purchased Asset and all income, proceeds and other monies received by
Seller to the extent related to such Purchased Asset in connection with the
arrangements under this _Section 2.11_. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the provisions of this _Section 2.11_ shall not apply to any
consent or approval required under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law, which consent or approval shall be governed by _Section 6.5_.

 **Section 4.13** **Employee Benefit Matters**.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 4.13(a)_ sets forth a true, complete and correct list of each
Benefit Plan.

 

     

 

 



 

(b) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code is so qualified and has received a favorable determination or approval
letter from the IRS with respect to such qualification, or may rely on an
opinion letter issued by the IRS with respect to a prototype plan adopted in
accordance with the requirements for such reliance, or has time remaining for
application to the IRS for a determination of the qualified status of such
Benefit Plan for any period for which such Benefit Plan would not otherwise be
covered by an IRS determination and no event or omission has occurred that
would cause any Benefit Plan to lose such qualification.

 



 

(c) Each Benefit Plan is, and has been operated in material compliance with
applicable Laws and regulations and is and has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with applicable Laws and regulations and with
its terms. No litigation or governmental administrative proceeding, audit or
other proceeding (other than those relating to routine claims for benefits) is
pending or, to the Sellers Knowledge, threatened with respect to any Benefit
Plan or any fiduciary or service provider thereof and there is no reasonable
basis for any such litigation or proceeding. All payments and/or contributions
required to have been made with respect to all Benefit Plans either have been
made or have been accrued in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Benefit Plan and applicable Law. The Benefit Plans satisfy in all material
respects the minimum coverage and discrimination requirements under the Code.

 



 

(d) No Benefit Plan is a single employer pension plan (within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA) for which the Seller or any ERISA Affiliate
could incur liability under Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or a plan maintained
by more than one employer as described in Section 413(c) of the Code.

 



 

(e) Neither the Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever maintained,
contributed to, or been required to contribute to (i) any employee benefit
plan that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA, Section 412 of the Code,
Section 302 of ERISA, (ii) a Multiemployer Plan, (iii) any funded welfare
benefit plan within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code, (iv) any "multiple
employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 210 of ERISA or Section 413(c)
of the Code), or (v) any "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (as such term
is defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), and neither the Seller nor any ERISA
Affiliate has ever incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA that has not
been paid in full.

 



 

(f) None of the Benefit Plans provides health care or any other non-pension
benefits to any employees after their employment is terminated (other than as
required by Part 6

 



      

 

 



 

of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA or similar state Law) and the Seller has
never promised to provide such post-termination benefits, except in connection
with previously executed separation agreements as consideration for a release
of claims and only after the employee has elected continuation coverage under
COBRA.

 



 

(g) Each Benefit Plan may be amended, terminated, or otherwise modified by the
Seller to the greatest extent permitted by applicable Law, including the
elimination of any and all future benefit accruals thereunder, and no employee
communications or provision of any Benefit Plan has failed to effectively
reserve the right of the Seller or the ERISA Affiliate to so amend, terminate
or otherwise modify such Benefit Plan. Neither the Seller nor any of its ERISA
Affiliates has announced its intention to modify or terminate any Benefit Plan
or adopt any arrangement or program which, once established, would come within
the definition of a Benefit Plan. Each asset held under each Benefit Plan may
be liquidated or terminated without the imposition of any redemption fee,
surrender charge or comparable liability. No Benefit Plan provides health or
disability benefits that are not fully insured through an insurance contract.
None of the Benefit Plans, nor any Liability of any kind thereunder or with
respect thereto, will be required by operation of law or otherwise to be
transferred to Buyer and/or its Affiliates as a result of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(h) The per share exercise price of each Seller option is no less than the
fair market value of a share of Seller common stock on the date of grant of
such Seller option determined in a manner consistent with Section 409A of the
Code. Each Benefit Plan that constitutes in any part a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code has been
operated and maintained in all material respects in operational and
documentary compliance with Section 409A of the Code and applicable guidance
thereunder. No payment to be made under any Benefit Plan is, or will be,
subject to the penalties of Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code.

 



 

(i) Except for any Benefit Plan that applies in relation to any UK Employee,
no Benefit Plan is subject to the Laws of any jurisdiction outside the United
States.

 



 

(j) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement, nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby could (either alone or in conjunction
with any other event) (i) entitle any current or former employee, independent
contractor, officer or director of the business to severance pay, unemployment
compensation, bonus payment or any other payment, (ii) result in, or cause
the accelerated vesting payment, funding or delivery of, or increase the
amount or value of, any payment or benefit to any current or former employee,
independent contractor, officer, director or other service provider of the
Seller or any of its

 



     

 

 



 

ERISA Affiliates; (iii) limit the right of the Seller, any of its Subsidiaries
or any of their ERISA Affiliates to amend, merger, terminate or receive a
reversion of assets from any Benefit Plan or related trust; (iv) entitle any
employee of the business to terminate, shorten or otherwise change the term of
his or her employment; (v) result in any "parachute payment" as defined in

be reasonable compensation for services rendered); or (vi) result in a
requirement to pay any Tax "gross-up" or similar "make-whole" payments to any
employee, director or consultant of the Seller or an ERISA Affiliate.

has made an offer of affordable minimum essential coverage to its respective
employees in the manner contemplated under Section 4980H of the Code to the

Taxes or penalties under Section 4980H of the Code or under the Affordable
Care Act or in connection with requirements relating thereto.

on the part of Buyer or, to the knowledge of Buyer, any other party thereto
under the Equity Financing Commitment. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in **ARTICLE VII** and the Equity Financing Commitment and based
upon facts and events known to Buyer on the date hereof, Buyer has no reason
to believe, as of the date hereof, any of the conditions to the funding of the
Equity Financing required to be satisfied by it will not be satisfied by the
time it is required to consummate the Closing hereunder. Assuming satisfaction
of the conditions set forth in **ARTICLE VII** and the Equity Financing
Commitment and based upon facts and events known to Buyer on the date hereof,
the funds provided pursuant to the Equity Financing Commitment, if funded in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Equity Financing Commitment,
will be sufficient for Buyer to have at the Closing funds sufficient to (a)
pay the Purchase Price, (b) pay any and all fees and expenses required to be
paid by Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated herein and (c)
satisfy all of the other payment obligations of Buyer contemplated hereunder
that are required to be satisfied in connection with the Closing.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Buyer acknowledges,
represents, warrants and agrees that consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein and the Closing shall not be conditioned upon Buyer
obtaining financing for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 5.8** **Sponsor Limited Guarantee**. Seller is a third party
beneficiary of the Equity Financing Commitment and may enforce the Equity
Financing Commitment directly against Sponsor for the purpose of
unconditionally guaranteeing the payment of the Purchase

 



     

 

 



 

Price and the other payment obligations of Buyer set forth in **ARTICLE II**.
As of the date hereof, (i) the Equity Financing Commitment is in full force
and effect and (ii) is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Sponsor,
enforceable against Sponsor in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles. As of the date hereof, (i)
there is no default under the Equity Financing Commitment by Sponsor and (ii)
no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or
both would constitute a default thereunder by Sponsor.

determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the Tax period of any
partnership or other pass-through entity in which the Purchased Subsidiary
holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time), and
the amount of any other Tax of the Purchased Subsidiary that is allocable to
the portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the portion of the

take effect prior to the Closing and (B) any such corporate or other action

as may be reasonably requested by Buyer (including delivery of a solvency
certificate of the chief financial officer); provided, however, that nothing
herein shall require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere

from any source other than those counterparty to, or in any amount in excess
of that contemplated by, the Equity Commitment Letter, (iii) waive any terms

and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, a Seller Indemnified

 **Section 8.4** **Certain Limitations**. The party making a claim under this
**ARTICLE VIII** is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ ", and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this **ARTICLE VIII** is referred
to as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ". The indemnification provided for in
_Section 8.2_ and _Section 8.3_ shall be subject to the following
limitations:

 



 

(a) Except in respect of any Losses in connection with claims arising from (i)
Fraud or (ii) as expressly contemplated by _Section 8.2_, the Seller shall

indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_, other than with respect to

8.2(a), 8.2(g) or 8.2(f), _ shall be made (i) first, against the RandW Insurance
Policy, to the extent such claim is or could be recoverable under the RandW
Insurance Policy, and (ii) second, after the foregoing sources of
indemnification or recovery are exhausted in accordance with _Section
8.4(c)_, against Sellers directly in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 8.2_ or _Section
8.3 _in respect of any Loss shall be limited to the amount of any liability or
damage that remains after deducting therefrom any insurance proceeds that the
Indemnified Party has received for such Losses (net of any costs of recovery
or other out-of-pocket costs resulting from making any claims thereunder) and
any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by the
Indemnified Party in respect of any such Loss. The Indemnified Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to recover under insurance policies or
indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses to the
extent that such Indemnified Party is entitled to such

 



     

 

 



 

indemnification or contribution in respect of such Losses prior to seeking
indemnification under this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 8.5** **Indemnification Procedures**.

 



 

(a) **Third Party Claims**. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of Legal Proceeding made or brought by any Person
who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this
Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a " _Third Party Claim_ ")
against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits material rights or defenses by
reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe
the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail (to the extent legally
permissible), shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof to
the extent reasonably practicable and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate
in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty days
after received of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying
Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense; _provided_ , however, that that the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to assume control of the defense of any Third Party Claim
(i) if the object of such Third Party Claim is to obtain an injunction,
restraining order, declaratory relief or other non-monetary relief against the
Indemnified Party, (ii) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation; (iii) the Indemnifying Party fails to prosecute or defend such
claim in a timely and reasonable manner; (iv) the claim involves any
significant customer, supplier or other material business relation of the
Business; (v) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the Loss
relating to such claim could exceed the maximum amount that the applicable
Indemnified Party could then be entitled to recover under the applicable
provisions of **ARTICLE VIII**; or (vi) if the named parties to any such
action or proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the former shall have been
advised in writing by counsel (with a copy to the Indemnifying Party) that
there are one or more legal or equitable defenses available to them that are
different from or additional to those available to Indemnifying Party. In the
event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third Party
Claim, subject to _Section 8.5(b)_, it shall have the right to take such
action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make
counterclaims pertaining to any such Third Party Claim in

 



     

 

 



 

the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim with counsel selected by it (other than any fees and
expenses of such separate counsel that are incurred prior to the date the
Indemnifying Party effectively assumes control of such defense which,
notwithstanding the foregoing, shall be borne by the Indemnifying Party)
subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to control the defense thereof. If
the Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third Party
Claim, is not entitled to assume such defense or fails to promptly notify the
Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section 8.5(b) _and at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, pay, compromise, defend such Third Party
Claim and seek indemnification, subject to the limitations set forth herein,
for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Third
Party Claim. Seller, Buyer and UK Buyer shall cooperate with each other in all
reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim,
including making available (subject to the provisions of _Section 6.6_)
records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense
(other than reimbursement of actual reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
expenses) to the defending party, management employees of the non-defending
party as may be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of
such Third Party Claim (subject to any applicable confidentiality agreement).

 



 

(b) **Settlement of Third Party Claims**. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of
any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if the
settlement (i) leads to liability, injunctive or other equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party or the creation of a financial or other
obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party for which the Indemnifying
Party does not have an obligation to indemnify under this **Article VIII** or
(ii) does not provide, in customary form, for the unconditional release of
each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with
such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party receives a firm offer to
enter into a settlement of the Third Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party
desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give
written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified
Party fails to consent to such firm offer within twenty (20) days after its
receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest or
defend such Third Party Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the
Indemnifying Party as to such Third Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of
such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may settle the Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth
in such firm offer to settle such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party
has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section 8.5(a),_ it shall not agree to
any settlement without the written consent of the

 



      

 

 



 

Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, it being understood that it shall be unreasonable to fail to consent
to the payment of only monetary damages).

 



 

(c) **Direct Claims**. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be
asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written
notice thereof, but no later than twenty (20) days after the Indemnified Party
first received knowledge thereof. The failure to give such prompt written
notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits material rights or defenses by reason of such
failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim
in reasonable detail (to the extent legally permissible), shall include copies
of all material written evidence thereof to the extent reasonably practicable
and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the
Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The
Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such
notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such thirty (30)-day
period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its
professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by giving such
information and assistance (including reasonable access to the Indemnified
Partys premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts,
documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional
advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond
within such thirty (30)-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to
have accepted such claim.

 



 

 **Section 8.6** **Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments**. All
indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the
Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

 



 

 **Section 8.7** **Exclusive Remedies**. Subject to _Section 10.11_, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any and all claims whether based on tort, contract or otherwise
(other than claims arising from intentional fraud or intentional
misrepresentation on the part of a party hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this
**ARTICLE VIII**. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives,
to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action for any breach

 



     

 

 



 

of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth
herein it may have against the other party hereto and their Affiliates and
each of their respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Law
(including without limitation any right to cost recovery or contribution under
Environmental Laws), except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this **ARTICLE VIII**. Nothing in this _Section 8.7_ shall limit
(a) any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to which any
Person shall be entitled pursuant to _Section 10.11_ or to seek any remedy on
account of Fraud.

 



 

 **Section 8.8** **Other Limitations**.

 



 

(a) If at any time subsequent to the receipt by an Indemnified Party of an
indemnity payment hereunder, such Indemnified Party (or any Affiliate thereof)
receives any recovery, settlement or other similar payment (other than from
the RandW Insurance Policy) with respect to the Loss for which it received such
indemnity payment (the " _Recovery_ "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly
pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the amount of such Recovery,
less any expense incurred by such Indemnified Party (or its Affiliates) in
connection with such Recovery, but in no event shall any such payment exceed
the amount of such indemnity payment.

 



 

(b) To the extent consistent with the common law doctrine of mitigation, each
Indemnified Party shall take, and cause its Affiliates to take, all
commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss, it being understood and
acknowledged that the reasonable cost of mitigation shall be an indemnifiable
Loss under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) For purposes of (i) determining the accuracy or breach of the
representations and warranties of set forth in this Agreement (other than in
respect of the term "material" in the names and definitions of the defined
terms "Material Adverse Effect," "Material Contracts," "Material Customers"
and "Material Suppliers") and (ii) calculating the amount of any Losses under
_Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_, the amount of the Loss shall be determined
without regard to any materiality qualification, including such terms as
"material" or "material adverse effect" contained in the applicable
representation and warranty.

 **ARTICLE IX** ** 
TERMINATION**

 



 

 **Section 9.1** **Termination**. This Agreement may be terminated at any
time prior to the Closing:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

 



 

(b) by Buyer by written notice to Seller if:

 



 

(i) Buyer and UK Buyer are not then in material breach of any provision of
this Agreement and there has been a breach, inaccuracy in or failure to

Date_ "); or

 



 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1 _or _Section 7.2_ shall

to the Closing;

 



 

(c) by Seller by written notice to Buyer if:

 



 

(i) Seller is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement

inaccuracy or failure cannot be, and has not been, cured by Buyer or UK Buyer
by the Drop Dead Date; or

 



 

(ii) any of the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ or _Section 7.3_ shall
not have been fulfilled by the Drop Dead Date, unless such failure shall be
due to the failure of Seller to perform or comply with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions hereof to be performed or complied with by it prior
to the Closing; or

 



     

 

 



 

(d) by Buyer or Seller in the event that:

contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited; or

 



 

(ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order

survive termination of this Agreement); and there shall be no liability on the
part of the Seller, on the one hand, or the Buyer and UK Buyer, on the other
hand, to one another; provided that no such termination shall relieve any
party of any liability arising out of an intentional and wilful material
breach of this Agreement or any agreement made as of the date hereof or

words "include," "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation"; (b) the word "or" is not exclusive; (c) the
words "herein," "hereof," "hereby," "hereto" and "hereunder" refer to this
Agreement as a whole, and (d) the words "ordinary course of business" shall
mean ordinary course of business, consistent with past custom and practice,
including with respect to timing, frequency and magnitude. Unless the context
otherwise requires, references herein: (x) to Articles, Sections, Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits mean the Articles and Sections of, and Disclosure
Schedules and Exhibits attached to, this Agreement; (y) to an agreement,
instrument or other document means such agreement, instrument or other
document as amended, supplemented and modified from time to time to the extent
permitted by the provisions thereof; and (z) to a statute means such statute
as amended from time to time and includes any successor legislation thereto
and any regulations promulgated thereunder. This Agreement shall be construed
without regard to any presumption or rule requiring construction or
interpretation against the party drafting an instrument or causing any
instrument to be drafted. Although the same or similar subject matters may be
addressed in different provisions of this Agreement, the parties intend that,
except as reasonably apparent on the face of the Agreement or as expressly
provided in this Agreement, each such provision shall be read separately, be
given independent significance and not be construed as limiting any other
provision of this Agreement (whether or not more general or more specific in
scope, substance or content). The Disclosure Schedules and Exhibits referred
to herein shall be construed consistent with this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

 **Section 10.4** **Headings**. The headings in this Agreement are for
reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.5** **Severability**. If any term or provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other term or
provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or
provision in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner
in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as
originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 



 

 **Section 10.6** **Entire Agreement**. This Agreement, the other Transaction
Documents and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the sole and entire
agreement of the Parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter
contained herein and therein, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
representations, warranties, understandings and agreements, both written and
oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency
between the statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the other
Transaction Documents, the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules (other than an
exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Schedules), the
statements in the body of this Agreement will control.

 



 

 **Section 10.7** **Successors and Assigns**. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither party may assign its rights or
obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other party,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided that_
either Party may assign its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in
part, to its debt financing sources as collateral security; to one or more of
its Affiliates; to any purchaser of all or substantially all of the assets or
equity interests (whether by merger, recapitalization, reorganization or
otherwise) of such Party or the Business (in the case of Buyer or UK Buyer);
or to any of such Partys Affiliates. No assignment shall relieve the
assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

 **Section 10.8** **No Third Party Beneficiaries**. Except as provided in
**ARTICLE VIII,** this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the Parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person or entity any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature

 



     

 

 



 

whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; provided that _Section
10.14_ is made for the benefit of the Non-Recourse Persons.

 



 

 **Section 10.9** **Amendment and Modification; Waiver**. This Agreement may
only be amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by
each party hereto. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof
shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the
party so waiving. No waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a
waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified
by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and
whether occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or
delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this
Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege.

 



 

 **Section 10.10** **Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of
Jury Trial**.

 



 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction).

 



 

(b) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA LOCATED IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION
OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL
TO SUCH PARTYS ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS
FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE
PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF
VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT,
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN
INCONVENIENT FORUM.

 



     

 

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL
ACTION, (B) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C)
SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _Section 10.10(c)_.

 



 

 **Section 10.11** **Remedies**.

 



 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that
the Parties shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereto,
without proof of damages, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 9.1_, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement and (b) the right to specific
enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and without that right, none of Seller, Buyer or UK Buyer would have
entered into this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Parties have an adequate remedy at law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section 10.11_ shall
not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such injunction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
under no circumstances will any party be entitled to both a grant of specific

 



     

 

 



 

performance or other equitable remedies of the sort described in this _Section
10.11_ and damages under this Agreement in respect of the same action, non-
action, matter or event.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything else in this _Section 10.11_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement (or any other document), the right of the Seller to seek
specific performance to force Buyer and UK Buyer to consummate the Closing, if
and only if, each of the following shall have been satisfied: (i) all
conditions in _Section 7.2_ (other than as set forth in _Section 7.2_ and
other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to their satisfaction at the Closing) have been satisfied
or waived by Buyer as of the date on which the Closing would otherwise be
required to occur, (ii) Buyer and UK Buyer are required to consummate the
Closing pursuant to _Section 3.1_, (iii) Buyer and UK Buyer fail to
consummate the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have occurred
pursuant to _Section 3.1_, and (iv) the Seller has irrevocably confirmed in
writing that if specific performance is granted, then the Closing will occur
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything else in this _Section 10.11_ or elsewhere in
this Agreement (or any other document), but expressly subject to Sellers
right to enforce the Equity Commitment Letter, the Seller and any other Person
shall not be entitled to receive recovery for, and Buyer and its Affiliates,
and their respective members, shareholders, investors, shall have no liability
or obligation with respect to, any loss suffered as a result of any breach by
the Buyer of this Agreement (or any other document) or otherwise arising out
of the transactions contemplated hereby, in an amount (aggregating all such
recoveries by any such Persons) in excess of $960,000 (the " ** _Damages
Cap_** "). In no event shall the Seller seek or obtain (and each of the
foregoing shall cause their Affiliates not to seek or obtain) (i) any monetary
recovery or award or any monetary damages of any kind, in the aggregate, in
excess of the Damages Cap, or (ii) any monetary damages other than actual,
direct, out-of-pocket damages (which excludes all consequential, incidental,
punitive, special, indirect, diminution in value, lost profits, damages based
on multiple of earnings or other financial metric damages).

 



 

 **Section 10.12** **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of
this Agreement delivered by facsimile, e-mail or other means of electronic
transmission shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an
original signed copy of this Agreement.

 



 

 **Section 10.13** **Disclosure Schedules**. Any information disclosed in any
Schedule shall be deemed disclosed for the purposes of all of the Schedules
and shall be deemed to qualify all representations and warranties in **ARTICLE
IV** and **ARTICLE V** to the extent such

 



      

 

 



 

qualification is reasonably apparent from the face of such Schedule. The
inclusion of, or reference to, any item within any particular Schedule does
not constitute an admission by Seller, Buyer or UK Buyer that such item meets
any or all of the criteria set forth in this Agreement for inclusion on such
Schedule. From time to time prior to Closing, Seller may provide informational
updates to the Disclosure Schedules to address matters arising after the date
hereof that if, in existence on the date hereof, would be required to be
disclosed on the Disclosure Schedules. Such informational updates shall not be
deemed to modify or qualify the representations and warranties in **ARTICLE
IV**.

 



 

 **Section 10.14** **Non-recourse**. This Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim, action, suit or other legal proceeding based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that
are expressly named as Parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein with respect to such party. No past,
present or future director, officer, employee, incorporator, manager, member,
partner, stockholder, financing source, Affiliate, agent, attorney, or other
Representative of any party hereto or of any Affiliate of any party hereto, or
any of their successors or permitted assigns (each, a " _Non-Recourse Person_
"), in such capacity, shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim, action,
suit or other legal proceeding based on, in respect of or by reason of the
transactions contemplated hereby, subject however to Sellers right to enforce
the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter against Sponsor. Each Non-Recourse
Person is expressly intended as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section
10.14_. This _Section 10.14_ shall not limit the obligations of the Non-
Recourse Persons who execute any Transaction Document or other agreement,
document or certificate in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement with respect to the subject matter thereof, including the
obligations of Sponsor under the Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

 **Section 10.15** **Retention of Counsel**. In any dispute or proceeding
arising under or in connection with this Agreement following the Closing,
Seller (and its owners) shall have the right, at their election, to retain
Messerli and Kramer, P.A. to represent all or any of them in such matter, and
Buyer and UK Buyer, for themselves and the Business and for their respective
successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably waives and consents to any such
representation in any such matter and the communication by such counsel to the
Seller (and its owners) in connection with any such representation of any fact
known to such counsel arising by reason of such counsels prior representation
of the Business. Buyer and UK Buyer, for themselves and the Business and for
their and such respective Persons Affiliates, successors and assigns,
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications between any of the
Business, on the one hand, and counsel, on the other hand, made in connection
with the negotiation,

 



     

 

 



 

preparation, execution, delivery and Closing under, or any dispute or
proceeding arising under or in connection with this Agreement or otherwise
that, immediately prior to the Closing, would be deemed to be privileged
communications of the Business, on the one hand, and its counsel, on the other
hand, and would not be subject to disclosure to the Buyer in connection with
any process relating to a dispute arising under or in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise, shall continue after the Closing and for all purposes
be deemed to be privileged communications among Seller (and, if applicable,
its owners), on the one hand, and such counsel, on the other hand, and neither
the Buyer nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the Buyer
shall seek to obtain the same by any process on the grounds that the privilege
attaching to such communications belongs to the Business, and not the Seller
(and, if applicable, its owners).
