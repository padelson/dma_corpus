of share ownership of AutoChina and employment by any Group Company except

each director, officer or manager of each Group Company, during the period
that he or she maintains a relationship with any Group Company as a director,
officer, consultant or employee and during the Non-Competition Period,
without the prior written permission of a majority of the Board, which
majority must include an affirmative vote from at least one (1) SCAC

or manager of any Group Company from investing his or her personal assets in
the securities of any corporation or other business entity which is engaged
in a Competitive Business if such securities are traded on an internationally
recognized stock exchange, such investment does not result in his or her
beneficially owning, at any time, more than one percent (1%) of the publicly-
traded equity securities of such Competitive Business, and such person does
not have any other relationship with such Competitive Business.

of Section 5.06 (b), (c) or (d), SCAC shall have the right and remedy to have
the provisions of this Section 5.06 specifically enforced by any
Governmental Authority, it being acknowledged and agreed by each Warrantor
that any such breach or threatened breach will cause irreparable injury to
SCAC and the Group Companies and that money damages will not provide an
adequate remedy.

5.06(c) or Section 5.06(d) is held to be unenforceable because of the scope,
duration or area of its applicability, the Governmental Authority making such
determination shall have the power to modify such scope, duration, or area,
