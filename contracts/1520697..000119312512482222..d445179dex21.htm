_PURCHASE AND SALE_

1A. _Purchase and Sale of Acquired Securities_. On the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Closing and upon payment of
the Estimated Purchase Price by Buyer in accordance with _Section 1C_, Buyer
shall purchase and accept from the Sellers, and the Sellers shall sell to
Buyer, all of the Acquired Securities.

or, if the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article 2_ shall not have been
satisfied by such date (or waived in writing), on the second Business Day
following the satisfaction (or waiver in writing) of such conditions. The
date on which the Closing shall occur is referred to herein as the " _Closing
Date_ ," and the Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01 a.m. (Chicago
time) on the Closing Date. On the Business Day immediately prior to
the Closing Date, Buyer and the Representative shall conduct a pre-Closing at
the same location as the Closing, commencing at 10:00 a.m. local time, at
which each of Buyer and the Representative shall present for review by the
other party copies in execution form of all documents required to be

required to be delivered under  _Section 2B_ in order for the conditions of
Buyer to be satisfied. At the election of the Buyer and Representative, the

instruments and consideration, as applicable, using wire transfers, overnight
courier service, electronic mail and/or facsimile transmission.

1C. _Closing Distributions_.

(i) At the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers in accordance with paragraph
(i) of _Section 1E_ of the Company Disclosure Letter an aggregate amount in
cash equal to the Estimated Purchase Price (less the Indemnity Escrow Deposit
Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Deposit Amount), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from Buyer to the account or accounts designated
by the Representative (which account or accounts, together with the amounts
payable to each Seller, shall be designated by the Representative in writing
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date).

 

(ii) At the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an aggregate amount equal to (a) the Indemnity Escrow Deposit
Amount to the Escrow Agent for deposit into a separate escrow account (the "
_Indemnity Escrow Account_ ") established pursuant to the terms of

 



-2-   an escrow agreement, substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached
hereto (the " _Indemnity Escrow Agreement_ "), among Buyer, the Representative
and the Escrow Agent, and (b) the Adjustment Escrow Deposit Amount to the
Escrow Agent for deposit into a separate escrow account (the " _Adjustment
Escrow Account_ ") established pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement,
substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_ attached hereto (the " _Adjustment
Escrow Agreement_ "), among Buyer, the Representative and the Escrow Agent.
The Indemnity Escrow Funds and the Adjustment Escrow Funds shall be maintained
separately in the Indemnity Escrow Account and the Adjustment Escrow Account,
respectively, and the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Adjustment Escrow Amount
shall be Buyers sole and exclusive source of recovery for any amounts owing
to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, except as otherwise set forth in
_Article 10_. The fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent shall be paid 50% by
Buyer and 50% by the Representative.

 

(iii) At the Closing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, Buyer shall pay to the intended beneficiaries thereof (as
identified by the Representative to Buyer at least two (2) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date) (a) amounts due and owing pursuant to the Credit
Facilities, (b) the Company Expenses (except with respect to any severance
obligations owed in connection the terminations of employment described in
Section 11K, which such amounts Buyer shall retain and pay to the applicable
former employees following the Closing in accordance with the terms of the
applicable agreements creating such severance obligations), (c) the
Representative Expenses, and (d) any other liabilities included in the
computation of Estimated Net Indebtedness which by their terms or pursuant to
this Agreement are required to be paid at Closing.

1D. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

 

(i) Within 60 days following the Closing Date, the Company shall, and Buyer
shall cause the Company to, prepare and deliver to the Representative (a) an
unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Adjustment
Calculation Time (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and (b) a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Companys calculation of Closing Net
Working Capital and Closing Net Indebtedness, and together with the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, Buyer shall deliver to the
Representative a certificate of Buyer that it has complied with the covenants
set forth in _Section 1D(vii)_. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with the methodologies,
practices, estimation techniques, assumptions and principles used in the
preparation of the Latest Audited Balance Sheet. The Closing Statement shall,
with respect to the Closing Net Working Capital, be derived from the Closing
Balance Sheet, and shall, with respect to both the Closing Net
Working Capital and the Closing Net Indebtedness, be prepared in accordance
with the applicable definitions set forth in this Agreement. During the 30
days immediately following the Representatives receipt of the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Statement and any period of dispute thereafter with
respect thereto, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, (x) cooperate
with the Representative in the review of the Closing Balance Sheet and Closing
Statement and provide the Representative and its representatives with full
access during normal business hours to the books, records (including work
papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data and
employees of the Company reasonably related to the Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Statement (and the preparation thereof) for purposes of their
review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, and (y)
cooperate fully with the Representative and its representatives in connection
with such review, including providing on a timely basis all other information
reasonably necessary or useful in

 



-3-   connection with the review of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing
Statement as is reasonably requested by the Representative or its
representatives. The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the
resulting calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Net
Indebtedness shall become final and binding upon the parties 30 days following
the Representatives receipt thereof unless the Representative gives
written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ") to Buyer
prior to such date; _provided_ _that_ the Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing
Statement and the resulting calculation of Closing Net Working Capital
and Closing Net Indebtedness shall become final and binding upon the parties
upon the Representatives delivery, prior to the expiration of the 30-day
period, of written notice to Buyer of its acceptance of the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Statement. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in
reasonable detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted.

(ii) If a timely Notice of Disagreement is received by Buyer, then the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement (as revised in accordance with this
_Section 1D(ii)_), and the resulting calculation of Closing Net Working
Capital and Closing Net Indebtedness, shall become final and binding upon the
parties on the earlier of (a) the date any and all matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement are finally resolved in writing by the Representative
and Buyer and (b) the date any and all matters specified in the Notice of
Disagreement not resolved by the Representative and Buyer are finally resolved
in writing by the Arbiter (as defined below). The Closing Balance Sheet and
the Closing Statement shall be revised to the extent necessary to reflect any
resolution by the Representative and Buyer and any final resolution made by
the Arbiter in accordance with this _Section 1D(ii)_. During the 30
days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement or such
longer period as the Representative and Buyer may agree in writing, the
Representative and Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any
differences which they may have with respect to any matter specified in the
Notice of Disagreement, and all such discussions related thereto shall (unless
otherwise agreed by Buyer and the Representative) be governed by Rule 408 of
the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable similar state rule. At the
end of such 30-day period, the Representative and Buyer shall submit to a
nationally recognized consulting firm with expertise in financial analysis
that is mutually selected by the Representative and Buyer (the " _Arbiter_ ")
for review and resolution of any and all matters (but only such matters) which
remain in dispute and which were included in the Notice of Disagreement. Buyer
and the Representative shall instruct the Arbiter to, and the Arbiter shall,
make a final determination of the items included in the Closing Balance Sheet
and the Closing Statement (to the extent such amounts are in dispute) in
accordance with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement.
Buyer and the Representative will cooperate (and Buyer shall cause the
Company to cooperate) with the Arbiter during the term of its engagement.
Buyer and the Representative shall instruct the Arbiter not to, and the
Arbiter shall not, assign a value to any item in dispute greater than the
greatest value for such item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the
Representative, on the other hand, or less than the smallest value for such
item assigned by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Representative, on the other
hand. Buyer and the Representative shall also instruct the Arbiter to, and the
Arbiter shall, make its determination based solely on presentations by Buyer
and the Representative that are in accordance with the guidelines and
procedures set forth in this Agreement ( _i.e._ , not on the basis of an
independent review). The presentations must be made within fifteen (15) days
of engaging the Arbiter and copies of such presentations shall be provided to
each party. The Closing Balance Sheet, the Closing Statement and the
resulting calculation of Closing Net Working Capital and Closing Net
Indebtedness shall become final and binding on the parties hereto on the date
the Arbiter delivers its final resolution in writing to Buyer and the
Representative (which final resolution shall be requested by the parties to be
delivered not more than 45 days following submission of such disputed
matters), and such resolution by the Arbiter shall not be subject to 

 



-4-   court review or otherwise appealable. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter
pursuant to this _Section 1D(ii)_ shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand,
and the Representative, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which
the aggregate portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears
to the aggregate amount actually contested by such party.

 

(iii) If the Estimated Purchase Price is less than the Purchase Price (such
shortfall, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), Buyer shall, within two (2) Business
Days after the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement become final
and binding on the parties pursuant to this _Section 1D_, make payment of the
Shortfall Amount by wire transfer in immediately available funds to, or as
directed by, the Representative. Furthermore, Buyer and the Representative
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the
Escrow Agent to make payment of the Adjustment Escrow Funds from the
Adjustment Escrow Account, within two (2) Business Days after the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement become final and binding on the
parties pursuant to this _Section 1D_, to, or as directed by,
the Representative, with such amounts, subject to _Section 11J_ hereof,
being distributable as a portion of the Additional Purchase Price as provided
in _Section 1D(v)_.

 

(iv) If the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price (such
excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), Buyer and the Representative shall deliver
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to cause the Escrow Agent to
make payment to Buyer, within two (2) Business Days after the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Statement become final and binding on the parties
pursuant to this _Section 1D_, by wire transfer in immediately available
funds of the Excess Amount from the Adjustment Escrow Amount in the Adjustment
Escrow Account. If the Excess Amount is greater than the Adjustment Escrow
Amount (such excess, the " _Adjustment Escrow Shortfall_ "), Buyer and the
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to

the provisions of this _Article 10_), the Sellers shall, collectively or

(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ "), from or with respect to,
any Losses suffered or incurred by any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to the
extent arising from or based upon:

 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Sellers, a Blocker or the Company contained in this Agreement;

(ii) any breach of any covenant of the Sellers contained in this Agreement
requiring performance following the Closing Date (the " _Post-Closing
Covenants_ "), including any covenant of payment set forth in _Section
11G(ix)_, but excluding any covenant set forth on _Schedule 10A(vi)_ ;

 

(iii) any breach of any covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement
requiring performance prior to the Closing Date (but only to the extent such

(iv) any claims for recoupment, offset, repayment or similar actions seeking
to recover any moneys in respect of past payments against the Company of every

(v) any of the matters set forth on _Schedule 10A(v)_ ; or

10B. _Indemnification by Buyer_. From and after the Closing (but subject to
the provisions of this  _Article 10_), Buyer shall indemnify the Seller
Parties against, and hold harmless the Seller Parties from, any Losses
suffered or incurred by any such indemnified party prior to the Limitation
Date to the extent directly arising from any breach of any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in this Agreement or any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement requiring performance by Buyer
prior to the Closing or by Buyer or the Company from or after the Closing
Date.

10C. _Limitations on Indemnification; Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(i) No claims for indemnification by Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
_Section 10A(i)_ or _10A(iii)_  shall be asserted, and no Buyer Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section 10A(i)_ or
_10A(iii)_ , (A) where the loss relating to such claim, or series of related
claims, is less than $5,000, and (B) unless and until the aggregate amount of
all Losses indemnifiable thereunder exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount
equal to $1,000,000

 



-31-   (the " _Deductible_ "), and then once such Deductible is exceeded, the Buyer
may seek indemnification and the Seller Parties shall be liable only to the
extent of such excess; provided, however, that such limitations shall not
apply to claims for Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect
of any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or
the representations and warranties contained in _Sections 5G_ (Tax Matters),
_6H_ (Tax Matters), _6M_ (Employee Benefit Plans) or _6R_ (Health Care
Regulatory Compliance).

(ii) All claims for indemnification by Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to
_Section 10A(i)_, _10A(iii)_ , _10A(iv)_ and _10A(vi)_ shall be asserted
solely and exclusively against the Indemnity Escrow Amount then remaining in
the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Indemnity Escrow
Agreement and the Indemnity Escrow Amount then remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Account shall be the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive
source of recovery for any amounts owing to any Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to Sections _10A(i)_ , _10A(iii)_ , _10A(iv)_ and _10A(vi)_ ;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such limitations shall not apply to claims for
Losses based upon, arising out of or otherwise in respect of any inaccuracy in
or breach of any of the Fundamental Representations. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the maximum aggregate amount that the
Buyer Indemnified Parties may seek for indemnification or that otherwise may
be required to be indemnified for by any Seller under this _Article 10_ shall
not exceed the net proceeds received by such Seller (inclusive of amounts
received by a Seller and such Sellers Affiliates by virtue of their
respective ownership interests in Holdings) pursuant to this Agreement.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer
Indemnified Parties may recover from the Indemnity Escrow Account the full
amount of any Losses such Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to be
indemnified for under this Agreement, whether such Losses arise from or are
based upon a breach of or inaccuracy in any of the representations and
warranties of a Seller, a Blocker or the Company. In the event any
Buyer Indemnified Parties incur any indemnifiable Losses arising from or
based upon (1) a breach of or inaccuracy in any of the Fundamental
Representations, (2) a breach of a Post-Closing Covenant or (3) any of the
Identified Matters, such Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the right to
recover all or any portion of such Losses from (x) the Indemnity Escrow
Account or (y) any one or more Sellers on a joint and several basis subject to
the last sentence of  _Section 10C(ii)_, and in the event that such Buyer
Indemnified Party obtains recovery from the Indemnity Escrow Account pursuant
to _Section 10C(iii)(x)_ the Sellers hereby agree to pay, jointly and
severally, to the Escrow Agent the amount of such Losses so recovered from
the Indemnity Escrow Account for re-deposit into the Indemnity Escrow Account
to be held in accordance with the Indemnity Escrow Agreement (each, a "
_Replenishment Obligation_ ");  _provided_ _that_ , if a Seller breaches
(each, a " _Breaching Seller_ ") a Fundamental Representation or a Post-
Closing Covenant, in each case, that is particular to such Seller (each a "
_Specific Seller Breach_ "), and a Buyer Indemnified Party obtains recovery
for such Specific Seller Breach from the Indemnity Escrow Account, then such
Breaching Seller shall only be responsible for such Replenishment Obligation.

 

(iv) Each party acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing
(except for disputes under  _Section 1D_, which disputes will be resolved in
accordance with the dispute mechanism set forth in _Section 1D_), its sole
and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims relating to the
subject matter of this Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article 10_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the liability of any party under this
Agreement shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any other liability
that such party may have at law or equity for fraud and none of the provisions
set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this
Agreement of any right or remedy

 



-32-   which such party may have at law or equity based on any other partys fraud,
nor shall any such provisions limit, or be deemed to limit (A) the amounts of
recovery sought or awarded in any such claim for fraud, (B) the time period
during which such a claim for fraud may be brought (subject to any applicable
statute of limitations), or (C) the recourse which any such party may seek
against another party with respect to such a claim for fraud; provided that
nothing in this Section shall allow any party to recover more than once for
the same Loss(es). Any claim for fraud for which a party suffering Losses
arising therefrom shall be brought outside this Agreement and not under this
Agreement.

(v) If at any time or from time to time a Seller is obligated to (i) make
any payments to the Buyer Indemnified Parties under or otherwise with respect
to the indemnification provisions contained in this Agreement (including any
Replenishment Obligation) or (ii) incur any expenses (including reasonable
attorney fees) in handling, defending, settling, satisfying, paying,
performing or processing any payments or claims in connection with or arising
out of the indemnification provisions contained in this Agreement or otherwise
(such Seller, an " _Indemnifying Seller_ " and each of clauses (i) and (ii),
a " _Funding Obligation_ "), in each case, other than in connection with an
Indemnifying Sellers Specific Seller Breach, then each Seller that is not the
Indemnifying Seller (the " _Contributing Sellers_ ") hereby agrees to
promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Seller for his or its Contributing Seller
Pro Rata Portion of the Funding Obligations satisfied by the Indemnifying
Seller by delivery of check or wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account or accounts designated by the Indemnifying Seller. A
Contributing Sellers " _Contributing Seller Pro Rata Portion_ " means the
percentage set forth opposite such Contributing Sellers name in _Section
10C_ of the Company Disclosure Letter. After the Indemnifying Seller
determines to seek reimbursement in respect of a Funding Obligation, the
Indemnifying Seller shall provide each Contributing Seller a written notice
(a " _Funding Notice_ ") of the Funding Obligation, setting forth the
aggregate amount of such Funding Obligation, such Contributing Sellers
required reimbursement obligation and the manner in which such reimbursement
obligation is to be fulfilled. Each Contributing Seller shall fund its
required reimbursement obligation as set forth in the Funding Notice on the
date designated therein by check or wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account number(s) set forth in the Funding Notice. The failure
of the Indemnifying Seller to deliver a Funding Notice pursuant to this
_Section 10C(v)_ shall not limit the rights or obligations of the
indemnifying Seller or the other Contributing Sellers under this Agreement.

10D. _Termination of Indemnification_. The obligations to indemnify and
hold harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation or
warranty or covenant shall terminate when the applicable representation or
warranty or covenant terminates pursuant to _Section 11A_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not
terminate with respect to any item as to which the Person to be indemnified
shall have, prior to the Limitation Date, previously made a claim by
delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable detail the nature of, and
factual and legal basis for, any such claim for indemnification, and the
provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is
made) to the Indemnifying Party in accordance with this Agreement.

10E. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

 

(i) In order for a Person that has rights of indemnification under this
Agreement (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any
indemnification provided for under this

 



-33-   Agreement in respect of a claim or demand made by any Person against the
Indemnified Party (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party must
notify the indemnifying party (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing, and
in reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim as promptly as reasonably
possible after receipt by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third Party
Claim; _provided_ _that_ failure to give such notification on a timely basis
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of such
failure; _provided_ _further_ that, for purposes of making claims against the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, written notice to the Representative shall be deemed
written notice to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this _Section 10E(i)_.
Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party,
within five (5) Business Days after the Indemnified Partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
Indemnified Party relating to the Third Party Claim. 

(ii) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it elects, to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnifying Party may not assume the
defense of any Third Party Claim if such claim (i) could result in
imprisonment of or imposition of a civil or criminal fine against the
Indemnified Party or its representatives, (ii) could result in an equitable
remedy that would impair the Indemnified Partys ability to exercise its
rights under this Agreement, or with respect to a Buyer Indemnified Party,
impair such Buyer Indemnified Partys right or ability to own or operate its
assets or properties or conduct its businesses, including the Business, or
(iii) the claim names both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
(including impleaded parties) and representation of both such parties by the
same counsel would create a conflict in the determination of the Indemnified
Party. Should an Indemnifying Party elect to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such
defense, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from
the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. If the Representative
(on behalf of the Sellers) is defending a Third Party Claim, the reasonable
expenses of the Representative incurred in defending a Third Party Claim (or
any participation in a Third Party Claim that could result in Losses to the
Representative) shall be reimbursed, when and as incurred, from the Indemnity
Escrow Funds. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend any Third Party
Claim, all the parties hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or
prosecution of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Further, if an Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall agree prior
thereto, in writing, that it is liable under this _Article 10_ to indemnify
the Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms contained herein in
respect of such claim (subject to the limitations and other terms and
conditions set forth herein) and shall conduct such defense diligently;
_provided,_ _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not without the
written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the matter which (x) does not
include a provision whereby the plaintiff or the claimant in the matter
releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto, (y) in
the case of Buyer Indemnified Parties, does not include any provision that
would impose any obligation (including an obligation to refrain from taking
action) upon Buyer, the Company

 



-34-   or their Affiliates or (z) the Losses resulting therefrom are not fully
indemnified for by the Indemnifying Party. Whether or not the Representative
shall have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, neither Buyer nor any
of its Affiliates shall admit any liability with respect to, consent to the
entry of any judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Representative (which shall
not be unreasonably held).

10F. _Certain Additional Matters_.

 

(i) The amount of any and all Losses under this _Article 10_ shall be
determined net of (a) the amount of any Tax Benefit actually received by any
party seeking indemnification hereunder arising from the deductibility of any
such Losses and (b) any amounts recovered by an Indemnified Party or any of
such Indemnified Partys Affiliates under or pursuant to any insurance
policy, Run-Off Insurance Policy, title insurance policy, indemnity,
reimbursement arrangement or contract (less any reasonable costs required to
obtain any such recovery and any increases in premiums as a result of
such recovery) pursuant to which or under which the Company is a party or has
rights (collectively, " _Alternative Arrangements_ "). Subject to the
Companys obligation to purchase the Run-Off Insurance Policies, Buyer shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain Alternative Arrangements
in effect for the Company following the Closing that are substantially similar
to the Alternative Arrangements in effect for the Company immediately prior to
the Closing. If a Tax Benefit is actually received by an Indemnified Party
after an indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly reimburse such amount (but not in excess of the indemnification
payment actually received from the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Loss) to the Indemnifying Party.

(ii) In no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to recover or make a
claim for any amounts in respect of, and in no event shall "Losses" be deemed
to include, (a)(1) any punitive, indirect or exemplary damages, or (2) any
losses, liabilities damages or expenses for lost profits or diminution in
value or any "multiple of profits", "multiple of cash flow" or similar
valuation methodology used in calculating the amount of Losses, or (b) in the
case of Buyer, any loss, liability, damage or expense to the extent included
in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital or Closing Net Indebtedness
or reserved against in the Closing Balance Sheet. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, "Losses" shall include and the Buyer Indemnified Parties may be
entitled to make a claim for the Losses (x) described in (a)(1) of the
foregoing sentence to the extent a Buyer Indemnified Party pays such Losses to
a third party pursuant to a Third Party Claim or (y) described in (a)(2) of
the foregoing sentence to the extent such Losses have a detrimental and
reoccurring effect on the Companys consolidated earnings after the Closing.

 

(iii) Any indemnity payment under this Agreement shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes. 

(iv) No Buyer Indemnified Party shall have any right to indemnification under
_Section 10A_ or otherwise under this Agreement to the extent such Losses
consist of Taxes that (i) are attributable to taxable periods (or portions
thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, other than those Losses directly
resulting from Sellers failure to timely file any Tax Returns required to be
filed by the Representative, HEP or Siguler under _Section 11G(i)_, to
include a Code Section 754 election under _Section 11G(v)_ or failure to take
any other action with respect to timely payment of Taxes required under
_Section 11G_, which failure results in an increase in Taxes for such taxable
periods (or portions thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or other Tax
detriment to Buyer for which Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification

 



-35-   under _Section 10A_; (ii) are due to the unavailability in any taxable
period (or portion hereof) beginning after the Closing Date of any net
operating losses, credits or other Tax attribute of the Company or the
Blockers from a taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the
Closing Date; or (iii) are attributable to any breach or other violation of
_Section 11G(ii)_.

 

(v) In the event that a representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement (other than  _Section 6E(i)_, the first sentence
of _Section 6F_ and the first sentence of _Section 6I_) is qualified by
words or phrases such as "material," "materially," "material
respects," "Material Adverse Effect," or words of similar import, such
qualifiers shall be disregarded following the Closing for purposes of
determining whether a breach of such representation or warranty has occurred
and for calculating the amount of any Losses for which the Indemnified
Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(vi) Any amounts owed by the Sellers to any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant
to this Agreement shall be first claimed and recovered against the Indemnity
Escrow Account in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement prior to, and as a condition of, the Sellers obligation to
otherwise indemnify, defend and hold harmless any Buyer Indemnified Party
(subject to claims in which the Indemnity Escrow Account is the sole and
exclusive remedy). Subject to the other limitations contained herein, each
Seller shall be solely responsible for any and all Losses in excess of
the Indemnity Escrow Amount based upon, arising out of or otherwise in
respect of any inaccuracy in or breach by such Seller of any representation or
warranty of such Seller contained in _Article 4_ of this Agreement, and for
the avoidance of doubt, no Pro Rata Share shall be taken into account for
such inaccuracies or breaches.

(vii) Each Indemnified Party hereby waives any subrogation rights that its
insurer may have with respect to any indemnifiable Losses. After any
indemnification payment is made to any Indemnified Party pursuant to this
_Article 10_, the Indemnifying Party shall, to the extent of such payment,
be subrogated to all rights (if any) of the Indemnified Party against any
third party in connection with the Losses to which such payment relates.
Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, any Indemnified
Party receiving an indemnification payment pursuant to the preceding sentence
shall execute, upon the written request of the Indemnifying Party, any
instrument reasonably necessary to evidence such subrogation rights.

 

ARTICLE 11

 

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

11A. _Survival_. The representations and warranties of the parties, and

the aggregate amount (the " _Claim Amount_ ") for which valid claims for
indemnification were made against the Indemnity Escrow Amount prior to the
Limitation Date and 

 



-36-   not yet resolved. Furthermore, within five (5) Business Days after it is
determined that all or any portion of the Claim Amount is not owed to Buyer
hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall, pursuant to the terms of the Indemnity
Escrow Agreement, release to, or as directed by, the Representative such
portion of the Claim Amount. Subject to _Section 11J_, any amounts received
by the Representative pursuant to this  _Section 11A_ shall be received for
the Sellers.

11B. _Press Release and Announcements_. The Company (including its
Subsidiaries), the Sellers, the Blockers and Buyer agree that, from the date
hereof until the Closing Date, no public release or announcement concerning
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued or made by or on behalf
of any party without the prior consent of the other parties, except that the
Company may at its discretion make announcements from time to time to its
employees, customers, suppliers and other business relations, and otherwise as
the Company may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with applicable
law or the requirements of any agreement to which the Company is a party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that Buyer (and
Guarantor) is expressly permitted to issue one or more press releases or
other public announcements concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement immediately following the execution of this Agreement and the
Closing and at such times may file any documents describing the transactions
contemplated herein to the extent required by securities laws or to comply
with accounting or other disclosure obligations (in each case in the
reasonable judgment of counsel to Buyer (and Guarantor). The Sellers, the
Blockers, the Company and Buyer agree to keep the terms of this Agreement
confidential, except to the extent required by applicable law or for financial
reporting purposes and except that the parties may disclose such terms to
their respective employees, accountants, advisors and other representatives
as necessary in connection with the ordinary conduct of their respective
businesses (so long as such Persons agree to or are bound by contract to keep
the terms of this Agreement confidential), and Linden, Siguler and their
Affiliates (except for the Company) may provide information about the subject
matter of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in
connection with Lindens, Sigulers, or their Affiliates fund raising,
marketing, information and reporting activities.

11C. _Confidentiality_.

 

(i) Buyer acknowledges that all information provided to it and any of its and
its Affiliates agents and representatives by the Company and its Affiliates,
agents and representatives (including pursuant to _Section 3A_) is subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement between or on behalf of the Company
and Buyer or one or more of their respective Affiliates or other beneficial
owners (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are hereby
incorporated herein by reference.

 

(ii) The Sellers acknowledge that they may be in possession of Confidential
Information (as defined below) of special value to the Company and its
Subsidiaries. For purposes of this _Section 11C_, the term " _Confidential
Information_ " means all information exclusively related to the businesses,
operations and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than
information which is generally available to the public, except as a result of
a breach by the Seller of this Agreement), including the Companys and its
Subsidiaries confidential and proprietary information about its business,
facilities, clinics, financial condition, products, technology, know-how and
business programs and plans. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the
Confidential Information is proprietary and confidential in nature. From and
for a period of five (5) years after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall
maintain in confidence, and shall not disclose any such Confidential
Information. The foregoing shall not prohibit disclosure of such 

 



-37-   information (i) as is required by applicable law (after such Seller has
advised and consulted with Buyer about its intention to make, and the proposed
contents of, such disclosure);  _provided_ , that the Sellers shall provide
Buyer with prompt written notice of such request so that Buyer may seek an
appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy and, if such
protective order or remedy is not obtained, the Sellers may disclose only
that portion of the Confidential Information which such Seller is legally
required to disclose, and such Seller shall exercise its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded to such Confidential Information so disclosed or (ii) as is
necessary for the Sellers to assert or protect any rights of such Seller
hereunder.

11D. _Consents_. Buyer acknowledges that certain consents to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to contracts,
leases, licenses or other agreements to which the Company is a party
(including the Company Material Contracts, as required to be disclosed on
_Section 6D_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule), and such consents have not
been obtained and may not be obtained. Buyer agrees that neither the Company
nor any of the Seller Parties shall have any liability whatsoever to Buyer
(and Buyer shall not be entitled to assert any claims) arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or because of the default, acceleration or termination of or loss of right
under any such contract, lease, license or other agreement as a result
thereof; provided, however, nothing in this _Section 11D_ amends or limits
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 6D_ or reduces or
relieves any liability of the Sellers for a breach of or inaccuracy in any of
such representations or warranties. 

11E. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in this  _Section 11E_), each of Buyer,
the Sellers and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
other parties conditions to Closing to be satisfied and for the Closing to
occur. The "reasonable best efforts" of the Company shall not for any purpose
in connection with this Agreement require the Company or any of its Affiliates
to expend any money to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty
hereunder or to commence any litigation or arbitration proceeding.

11F. _Regulatory Act Compliance_.

 

(i) Buyer and the Company shall each file or cause to be filed, promptly (but
in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the date of this Agreement,
any notifications or the like required to be filed under the HSR Act and other
antitrust or competition laws of any applicable jurisdiction with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer and the Company shall bear the
costs and expenses of their respective filings and shall bear all filing fees
in connection therewith equally. Buyer and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to respond to any requests for
additional information made by any agencies and to cause the waiting periods
or other requirements under the HSR Act and all other applicable antitrust or
competition laws to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date
(including with respect to filings under the HSR Act, seeking early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act) and, subject to the
Representatives rights under _Section 8A_, to resist in good faith
(including the institution or defense of legal proceedings), any assertion
that the transactions contemplated hereby constitute a violation of the
antitrust or competition laws of any applicable jurisdiction, all to the end
of expediting consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of
Buyer and the Company shall (A) unless otherwise prohibited by applicable
law, promptly notify each other of

 



-38-   any communication to that party from the Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_
"), the United States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") or any other
regulatory agency with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and
permit the other party to review in advance any proposed written communication
to the FTC, the DOJ or any other regulatory agency; (B) unless otherwise
prohibited by applicable law, furnish the other party with copies of all
correspondence, filings and other communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it, its Affiliates and their respective
representatives, on the one hand, and the FTC, the DOJ or any other
regulatory agency, or members of their respective staffs, on the other hand,

(ii) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer
agrees to take any and all commercially reasonable steps necessary to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any law that may be asserted by
any Governmental Entity or any other Person so as to enable the parties to
expeditiously close the transactions contemplated hereby, including
consenting to any commercially reasonable divestiture or other structural or
conduct relief in order to obtain clearance from any Governmental Entity. At
the written request of the Company, to the extent it is commercially
reasonable for such parties, Buyer and its Affiliates will be obligated to
contest, administratively or in court, any ruling, order, or other action of
any Governmental Entity or any other Person respecting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

take all action commercially reasonably necessary (including providing a power
of attorney) to enable the Representative, HEP, or Siguler, as applicable, to
exercise its control rights as set forth in this _Section 11G_. provided ,
however , that the failure to give notice as provided in this _Section 11G_
shall not affect Buyers right to indemnification under this Agreement except
to the extent Sellers shall have been prejudiced by such failure. Further, if
the Representative or a Seller Party assumes the defense of a Tax Proceeding,
such party shall agree prior thereto, in writing, that it is liable under
this Agreement to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties in accordance with
the terms contained herein in respect of such Tax Proceeding (subject to the
limitations and other terms and conditions set forth herein) and
shall conduct such defense diligently; _provided,_ _however_ , that the
Representative or applicable Seller Party shall not without the written
consent of the Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement

the effect of increasing any Tax liability of any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or their Affiliates following the Closing Date or (z) the Losses
resulting therefrom are not fully indemnified for by the Sellers.

(iv)  _Cooperation_. Buyer, the Blockers, the Company, Sellers and the

Siguler under _Section 11G(i)_), any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes and the computation and verification of any amounts
paid or payable under this _Section 11G_ (including any supporting
workpapers, schedules and documents). Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Except for books and records pertinent to federal, state and local
income Tax matters with respect to the Company and the Blockers for periods
ending on or before the Closing Date (which books and records shall be
retained by the Representative, HEP, or Siguler, as applicable, and copies of
which shall be provided to Buyer at the Closing), the Company and the Blockers
shall retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to
the Company and the Blockers relating to any tax periods and shall abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and
shall give the Representative, HEP, or Siguler, as applicable, reasonable
written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books
and records prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
for that tax period, and if the Representative, HEP, or Siguler, as
applicable, so requests, the Company and the Blockers shall allow
the Representative, HEP, or Siguler, as applicable, to take possession of
such books and records rather than destroying or discarding such books and
records.

(v) _Company 754 Election_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, the parties hereto agree that the Company will make an election
under Code Section 754 on its partnership tax return that includes the
Closing Date, or as otherwise specifically directed in writing by Buyer to the
Company prior to filing any Tax Returns hereunder.

 

(vi) _Section 338_. Buyer shall not make any election under Code Section 338
(or any similar provision under state, local, or foreign law) with respect to
the acquisition of any Blocker or any of their Affiliates.

 

(vii) _Tax Year End; Allocation of Taxes_. Buyer shall not take any action
that may prevent the Tax year of any Blocker from ending under applicable law
for federal and state income tax purposes at the end of the day on which the
Closing occurs (including for federal income tax purposes, causing Blockers to
join in the "consolidated group" of Buyer (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation §1.1502-1(h)). In any case where applicable Law does not permit the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any Blocker to treat the Closing
Date as the last day of the Taxable period, the amount of Taxes that are
allocable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date shall be: (A) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis
with respect to the business or assets of the Company, any Subsidiary of
the Company, or any Blocker, as applicable, the amount of such Taxes for the
entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of calendar days in the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period; and (B) in the case of Taxes that
are based upon or related to income, gross or net sales, payments or receipts
(including any income Taxes), deemed equal to the amount that would be
payable if the taxable period ended on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any Taxes relating to any transactions not in the ordinary course
of business that occur after the time of the Closing on the Closing Date
shall be treated as occurring on the day after the Closing Date.

(viii) _Tax Treatment of Acquisition_. For federal and applicable state
income tax purposes, the parties acknowledge and agree that the Blocker Pre-
Closing Distribution shall be

 



-42-   treated (A) as a distribution under Code §731 of each Blockers respective
proportionate, undivided indirect ownership interest in the assets of the
Company (including any assets of Subsidiary of the Company which is treated
as a disregarded entity for federal or applicable state and local income tax
purposes) and (B) as a subsequent contribution under Code §721 of such assets
to the Company in exchange for Units of the Company, and such transactions
shall be reported by the parties consistently therewith for federal and
applicable state and local income tax purposes. For U.S. federal and
applicable state and local income tax purposes, the parties agree to treat
the transfer of the Acquired Securities to Buyer in exchange for Buyer paying
the Purchase Price to Sellers on the terms and conditions set forth herein as
(A), in the case of the Acquired Units, as a sale of partnership interests in
the Company to Buyer and (B), in the case of the Acquired Shares, as a sale
of capital stock in the Blockers to Buyer.

(ix) _Tax Liabilities_.

(A) Sellers shall be responsible for, pay and indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties from (i) all Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-
Closing Tax Periods, (ii) all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Company or
any Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period as a result being a member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which the Company and
its Subsidiaries (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is or was a
member on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) all Taxes of any Person (other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries) imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as a transferee or successor, by contract (other than (a) any
customary agreements with customers, vendors, lenders, lessors or the
like entered into in the ordinary course of business, (b) property Taxes
payable with respect to properties leased, and (c) other agreements for which
Taxes is not the principal subject matter) or pursuant to any law, rule or
regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction occurring before
the Closing, or (iv) Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
resulting from the Blocker Pre-Closing Distribution, Texas Blocker Redemption

(ii) all Taxes of any Person imposed on the HEP Blocker for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period as a result being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined,

(x) _Tax Refunds_. Except to the extent (i) any Tax refund is reflected as an
asset in the Closing Net Working Capital or (ii) such Tax refund relates to a
carryback of any Tax attribute from any taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date, the Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers) shall be entitled to (A) any Tax refunds that are actually received
by the Buyer or the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, or any Blocker
(including any Tax refunds attributable to the carryback of items under
_Section 11G_), and (B) any amounts credited against Tax to which the Buyer
or the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, or any Blocker become entitled
in a Tax period ending after the Closing Date, in each case, that relate to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any
Blocker. The Buyer shall pay over to the Representative (on behalf of the
Sellers) any such refund within twenty (20) days after the actual receipt of
such Tax refund or within twenty (20) days of filing of the Tax Return
reflecting such credit. Buyer and Sellers shall request a refund (rather than
a credit against future Taxes) with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax Periods if
permitted by applicable Law. To the extent that Buyer has paid a Tax refund to
the Representative, and all or a portion of such Tax refund has subsequently
been determined to be due and owing to a Governmental Entity, without
duplication for any indemnification payments by any Seller hereunder related
to such Tax refund, the Sellers shall return to Buyer such amounts of such
Tax refund which have been determined to be due and owing to such Governmental
Entity.

(xi) _Carrybacks_. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns under
Section _11G_ , the Buyer and the Sellers agree that the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, and any Blocker shall elect to carry back any item
of loss, deduction or credit from the tax period ending on the Closing Date,
including any Transaction Tax Deductions deductible in such Tax

 



-44-   period, to prior taxable years to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Tax law (using any permissible short-form or accelerated procedures (including
filing IRS Form 1139 and any corresponding form for applicable state, local
and foreign tax purposes) and filing amended Tax Returns to the extent
necessary) and obtain any potential Tax refunds or claims related thereto.
Sellers shall be responsible for all costs and expenses with respect to
preparing any Tax Returns to utilize carry backs to obtain any Tax refund or
claims.

(xii)  _Transaction Tax Deductions_. In connection with the preparation of
Tax Returns under _Section 11G_, any Transaction Tax Deductions, to the
extent "more likely than not" deductible under applicable Tax law for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be treated as properly allocable to the Tax
period ending on the Closing Date and such Tax Returns shall include such
applicable Transaction Tax Deductions as deductions in the Tax Returns of the
Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, or any Blocker, as applicable, for
the Pre-Closing Tax Period that ends on the Closing Date. After the Closing,
the Representative shall cause the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, and
the Blockers to make a timely election to apply Rev. Proc. 2011-29 with
respect to any success based fees within the scope of such Rev. Proc. paid by
or on behalf of the Sellers, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, or
any Blocker. Sellers shall be responsible for all costs and expenses with
respect to making such election. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, in connection with preparing the Tax Returns described in _Section
11G_, within sixty (60) days after Closing, in consultation with its tax
counsel, Representative shall provide written notice (including any supporting
work papers, schedules, memoranda or documents) to the Buyer with respect to
its view (consistent with the "more likely than not" standard set forth in
this _Section 11G(xii)_ as to (A) the amount of the Transaction Tax
Deductions that are "more likely than not" deductible, (B) the amount and
description of any deduction that would be a Transaction Tax Deduction if it
were "more likely than not" deductible but that does not meet that standard
and (C) the taxable period in which the various Transaction Tax Deductions
that are "more likely than not" deductible would be deductible)
(collectively, the " _Deduction Statement_ "). If Buyer has any objections to
the Deduction Statement, it shall inform the Representative, in writing,
within sixty (60) days after receiving the Deduction Statement.
Representative and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute
and the Deduction Statement shall be modified accordingly. If the
Representative and Buyer do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30)
days after delivery of the Deduction Statement, Representative and Buyer shall
promptly submit any unresolved items regarding the Deduction Statement to the
mutually agreed third-party accountant for resolution (and shall execute
any customary engagement letter and agree to any other customary terms and
conditions of the engagement) for prompt resolution. The third-party
accountant in resolving such dispute shall apply a "more likely than not"
standard as to whether a Transaction Tax Deduction is deductible and the
appropriate Tax period in which such deduction shall be allocable.

(xiii) _Post-Closing Tax Savings_. Buyer shall pay to the Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) the amount of any reduction in Tax payments that would
otherwise be made in any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date by Buyer, the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, any Blocker
or any of their Affiliates that are attributable to any Transaction Tax
Deductions (or any amounts accrued as a liability in Net Working Capital as
finally determined pursuant to this Agreement) properly deductible in a
taxable period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date, in each
case, calculated by comparing the Taxes that would have been actually
payable without any such deductions and the Taxes actually payable taking
into account such deductions. Buyer shall pay over to the Representative (on
behalf of the Sellers) any such reduction in Taxes (as finally determined)
within twenty (20) days after the filing of the Tax Return related to such
reduction. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) the Sellers shall not be entitled
to receive and Buyer shall not have to pay to the Sellers the amount of any 

 



-45-   reduction in Tax payments or other Tax benefit that is attributable to any
net operating or capital loss or credit carryovers of the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, or any Blocker from any Pre-Closing Tax Period
that are utilized in a taxable period beginning after the Closing Date and (B)
for all purposes under this Agreement, Transaction Tax Deductions shall not be
treated as including any step-up in tax basis solely by reason of the Company
making an election under Code Section 754 as stipulated in _Section 11G(v)_
of this Agreement.

(xiv) _Tax Return Delivery_. Upon the written request of the Representative,
the Buyer shall deliver to the Representative copies of any filed Tax Returns
of the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, and any Blocker relating to
the Tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing
prepared in accordance with _11G_.

11H. _Insurance Matters_.

(i) Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company to, amend, repeal or
modify any provision in the Companys certificate of formation or limited
liability company agreement relating to the exculpation or indemnification of
former officers and managers of the Company as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing, it being the intent of the parties that the officers and managers
of the Company prior to the Closing shall continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law.

(ii) The Company will purchase, prior to or concurrent with the Closing (if
concurrent with the Closing, as part of the Company Expenses), prepaid
liability insurance policies (i.e., "tail coverage" or "nose coverage") that
will remain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date
(the " _Run-Off Insurance Policy_ "), the material terms of which, including
type, coverage and amount, are substantially similar to the insurance policies
maintained by the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
this _Section 11H_ shall survive the consummation of the Closing
indefinitely. In the event that Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective successors or assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person, or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its properties
or assets to any Person, then, and in each case, Buyer shall cause the
successors and assigns of Buyer or its Subsidiary(ies), as the case may be, to
expressly assume and be bound by the obligations set forth in this  _Section
11H_ as a condition to any such transaction.

11I. _Designation and Replacement of Representative_. The parties have agreed
that it is desirable to designate the Representative to act on behalf of the
Sellers for certain limited purposes, as specified herein. The parties have
designated Holdings as the initial Representative, and execution of
this Agreement by the Sellers shall, to the maximum extent permitted under
applicable law, constitute irrevocable ratification and approval of such
designation by the Sellers and authorization of the Representative to serve in
such capacity (including to settle any and all disputes with Buyer under this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreements), and shall also constitute a
reaffirmation, approval, acceptance and adoption of, and an agreement to
comply with and perform, all of the acknowledgments and agreements made by
the Representative on behalf of the Sellers in this Agreement and the other
documents delivered in connection herewith (including the Escrow Agreements).
The Representative may resign at any time and the Representative may
be removed only by the vote of Persons which collectively owned more than 50%
of the Units as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Majority Holders_
"). The designation of the Representative is coupled with an interest, and,
except as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, such designation
is irrevocable and shall not be

 



-46-   affected by the death, incapacity, illness, bankruptcy, dissolution or other
inability to act of any of the Sellers. In the event that the Representative
has resigned or been removed, a new Representative shall be appointed by a
vote of the Majority Holders, such appointment to become effective upon the
written acceptance thereof by the new Representative. Written notice of any
such resignation, removal or appointment of a Representative shall be
delivered by the Representative to Buyer promptly after such action is taken.

11J. _Authority and Rights of Representative; Limitations on Liability_. The
Representative shall have such powers and authority as are necessary or
appropriate to carry out the functions assigned to it under this Agreement and
in any other document delivered in connection herewith (including the Escrow
Agreements); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Representative will have no
obligation to act on behalf of the Sellers. The Company, Buyer and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely on the actions taken by the Representative
without independent inquiry into the capacity of the Representative to so act.
All actions, notices, communications and determinations by the Representative
to carry out such functions shall conclusively be deemed to have been
authorized by, and shall be binding upon, the Sellers. Neither the
Representative nor any of its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents
or representatives shall have any liability to the Sellers or the Company with
respect to actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Representative in such
capacity (or any of its officers, directors, managers, employees, agents or
representatives in connection therewith), except with respect to the
Representatives gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Representative
will at all times be entitled to rely on any directions received from the
Majority Holders; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Representative shall not
be required to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to
take any action in its capacity as Representative based upon any such
direction. The Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel,
experts and other agents and consultants as it shall deem necessary in
connection with exercising its powers and performing its function hereunder
and (in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Representative) shall be
entitled to conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The
Representative (for itself and its officers, directors, managers, employees,
agents and representatives) shall be entitled to full reimbursement for all
reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances (including fees and
disbursements of its counsel, experts and other agents and consultants)
incurred by the Representative in such capacity (or any of its officers,
directors, managers, employees, agents or representatives in connection
therewith), and to full indemnification against any loss, liability or
expenses arising out of actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity
as Representative (except for those arising out of the Representatives gross
negligence or willful misconduct), including the costs and expenses of
investigation and defense of claims, from the Sellers (including from funds
paid to the Representative under this Agreement and/or otherwise received by
it in its capacity as Representative, or funds to be distributed to the
Sellers under this Agreement at its direction, pursuant to or in connection
with this Agreement (including under the Escrow Agreements)). In furtherance
of the foregoing, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Representative shall have the power and authority to set aside and retain
additional funds paid to or received by it, or direct payment of additional
funds to be paid to the Sellers, as Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement
at Closing or thereafter, to satisfy such obligations (including to
establish such reserves as the Representative determines in good faith to be
appropriate for such costs and expenses that are not then known or
determinable). To the extent that any amount included as Representative
Expenses exceeds such expenses, disbursements or advances, the Representative
may retain such excess as a fee for the services it provides hereunder. The
relationship created herein is not to be construed as a joint venture or any
form of partnership between or among the Representative or any Seller for any
purpose of U.S. federal or state law, including federal or state income tax
purposes. Neither the Representative nor any of its Affiliates owes any
fiduciary or other duty to any Seller.

 



-47-  11K. _Employee Matters_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sellers
from any liability under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification
Act of 1988, 29 U.S.C. § 2101, et seq., as amended, or any similar foreign,
state or local law, regulation or ordinance (collectively, "WARN") that is
triggered by any termination of employees by Buyer or the Company following
the Closing. Buyer shall cause the Company to comply with any and all
applicable notice or filing requirements under WARN. Buyer shall be solely
responsible for complying with the requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code for any individual who is an
"MandA qualified beneficiary" as defined in QandA 4 of Treas. Reg. §54.4980B-9 in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Immediately
prior to the Closing, the Company (but not the Subsidiaries) shall terminate
the employment of its employees set forth on _Section 11K_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (the "Terminated Employees"). All employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries who are not Terminated Employees shall be referred to
herein as the "Continuing Employees". During the six-month period following
the Closing Date, with respect to the Continuing Employees who satisfy
Buyers screening requirements (including but not limited to background
checks), Buyer shall cause the Company to honor all employment, severance,
termination, consulting, retirement and other compensation and benefit plans,
arrangements and agreements to which the Company is a party, as such plans,
arrangements and agreements are in effect on the date hereof (it being
understood that this Section 11K shall not be deemed to prohibit Buyer or the
Company or its Subsidiaries from amending, modifying, replacing or terminating
such arrangements in accordance with their terms). Buyer shall take all
actions required so that the Continuing Employees who are so eligible shall
receive service credit for purposes of determining eligibility, vesting, and
future vacation or paid-time-off accrual and for purposes of determining
severance amounts under employee benefit plans and arrangements of the Buyer,
the Company or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates in which they participate
following the Closing Date (to the extent such service credit would be given
under such current Employee Benefit Plans). To the extent that Buyer modifies
any coverage or benefit plans under which the Continuing Employees
participate, Buyer shall waive (if permitted by applicable law) any applicable
waiting periods, or actively-at-work requirements and shall give such
Continuing Employees credit under the new coverages or benefit plans
for continuous coverage for pre-existing conditions, deductibles, co-
insurance and out-of-pocket payments attributable to such Continuing Employees
in which such coverage or plan modification occurs. This _Section 11K_ shall
survive the Closing, and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of
Buyer and the Company.

11L. _Representation of the Seller Group_. Each of the parties to this
Agreement hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
managers, members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Kirkland
and Ellis LLP may serve as counsel to each and any of the Representative, the
Sellers and their respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "
_Seller Group_ "), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Kirkland
and Ellis LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Seller Group or
any director, manager, member, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the
Seller Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement notwithstanding such representation or any continued representation
of the Company, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of
interest arising from such representation. Each of the parties to this
Agreement further agrees to permit (and shall take reasonable steps requested
by any party at such requesting partys expense so that) any privilege
attaching as a result of Kirkland and Ellis LLPs services as counsel to the
Company in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement to
survive the Closing and to remain in effect;  _provided_ _that_ such
attorney-client privilege from and after the Closing will be controlled by the
Representative. In addition, if the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, all of 

 



-48-   Kirkland and Ellis LLPs records related to such transaction will become
property of (and be controlled by) the Representative, and neither Buyer nor
the Company shall retain any copies of such records or have any access to
them.

11M. _Expenses; Transfer Taxes_. If this Agreement is terminated prior to
consummation of the Closing, each party shall pay all fees and expenses
incurred by such party in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise required by applicable law. If the Closing
occurs, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, all fees and expenses incurred
by Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise required by applicable law, any
and all Company Expenses and Representative Expenses (out of the Base
Purchase Price in accordance with Article 1), and all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other such transfer Taxes, and all
conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and charges (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

11N. _Distributions from the Escrow Agreements_. Distributions of Indemnity
Escrow Funds from the Indemnity Escrow Account shall be made pursuant to the
applicable provisions of the Indemnity Escrow Agreement and distributions of
Adjustment Escrow Funds from the Adjustment Escrow Account shall be made
pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Adjustment Escrow Agreement. Any
amount distributable to the Sellers in accordance with this  _Section 11N_
shall be released or disbursed to, or as directed by, the Representative, with
such amounts, subject to _Section 11J_ hereof, being distributable as a
portion of the Additional Purchase Price.

 

11O. _Certain Access Provisions_.

(i) For a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
preserve and retain, or cause the Company to preserve and retain, all
corporate, accounting, Tax, legal, auditing or other books and records of the
Company relating to the conduct of the business and operations of the Company
prior to the Closing Date.

(ii) After the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to permit the
Representative to have reasonable access to, and to inspect and copy, all
materials referred to in this _Section 11O_ and to meet with officers and
employees of Buyer and the Company on a mutually convenient basis in order to
obtain explanations with respect to such materials and to obtain additional
information and to call such officers and employees as witnesses. 

11P. _Post-Closing Payments_. Buyer shall promptly forward, or shall cause the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to forward, to the Representative any
and all proceeds or payments made to the Company or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries following the Closing Date in connection with that certain
indemnification claim made by the Company pursuant to that certain Unit
Purchase and Contribution Agreement, dated as of July 10, 2007, by and among
Behavior Centers of America Holdings, LLC, the Company, and the other
signatories thereto, in connection with disproportionate share payments
received by HMIH Cedar Crest, LLC for state fiscal years 2005-2007. If that
certain statutory eminent domain proceeding, _The State of Texas v. HMIH Cedar
Crest, LLC, Cause No. 67,8333, County Court at Law No. 3, Bell
County, Texas_, in which the State of Texas has acquired approximately 1.854
acres from Cedar Crest, LLC (the " _Eminent Domain Claim_ ") is not finally
determined, settled, or compromised with the State of Texas prior to the
Closing Date, then upon the Companys settlement or

 



-49-   compromise or the final determination of such Eminent Domain Claim (each a "
_Final Resolution_ "), then Buyer shall promptly forward, or shall cause the
Company and the Companys Subsidiaries to forward, to the Representative an
aggregate amount of cash equal to the following: (x) any and all proceeds or
payments made to the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries in
connection with or pursuant to such Final Resolution, _minus_ (y) all out-of-
pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the pursuit of such Final Resolution following the Closing
Date. The Sellers shall pay all costs and expenses reasonably required to be
incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries as a result of the Companys or
its Subsidiaries performance of any procedures, actions or other measures
required by the State of Texas as expressly set forth in the Final Resolution
(which such amount may be deducted from the payment from Buyer to the Sellers
pursuant hereto). In furtherance of the foregoing, if a Final Resolution has
not occurred by the Closing Date, then the Representative will assume, at its
sole cost and expense, the Eminent Domain Claim and have the right to settle,
compromise, resolve and enter into the Final Resolution, subject in all cases
to the provisions contained in this _Section 11P_. Buyer shall cause
the Company and its Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate with the
Representative in connection with the completion of the Final Resolution. Any
payments described in this _Section 11P_ made to the Representative shall be
by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated by the Representative and will be distributable as a portion of the
Additional Purchase Price as provided in _Section 1D(v)_.

12C. _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned
(including by operation of law) 

 



-52-   without the prior written consent of (i) prior to the Closing, the
Representative, the Company and Buyer and (ii) from and after the Closing,
Buyer and the Representative;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may
collaterally assign, without the prior written consent of any other party
hereto, its rights hereunder to its financial lender and may assign, without
the prior written consent of any other party hereto (whereupon Buyer shall
provide written notice thereof to the Sellers, the Company and the
Representative), any of its rights, benefits or obligations under this
Agreement to an Affiliate; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such assignment
shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that, in the case of an assignment by Buyer to an Affiliate, such
assignment shall not be effective vis-a-vis the other parties to
this Agreement unless such Affiliate agrees in writing to assume the
obligations of Buyer under this Agreement on a joint and several basis with
Buyer.

12D. _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

12E. _No Strict Construction_. Notwithstanding the fact that this Agreement
has been drafted or prepared by one of the parties, each of Buyer, the
Sellers, the Company and the Representative confirm that they and their
respective counsel have reviewed, negotiated and adopted this Agreement as the
joint agreement and understanding of the parties hereto and the language used
in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties
hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction
shall be applied against any Person.

 

12F. _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement and descriptions of the
Company Disclosure Letter are for convenience of reference only and do not
constitute a part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to limit,
characterize or in any way affect any provision of this Agreement, and all
provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and construed as if no
caption or description of the Company Disclosure Letter had been used in this
Agreement.

12G. _Complete Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the Escrow Agreements and any other agreements referred to herein
or therein executed and delivered on or after the date hereof, contain the
complete agreement among the parties hereto and supersede any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or between such parties,
written or oral, which may have related to the subject matter hereof in any
way.

12H. _Company Disclosure Letter_. The Company Disclosure Letter is
incorporated herein and shall be arranged in sections corresponding to the
sections contained in _Articles_ _IV_ , _V_  and _VI_ of this Agreement, and
any disclosure made in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
qualify other sections of the Company Disclosure Letter if it is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure that it is applicable to such other
sections of Company Disclosure Letter. The inclusion of information in the
Company Disclosure

 



-53-   Letter shall not be construed as or constitute an admission or agreement
that a violation, right of termination, default, liability or other obligation
of any kind exists with respect to any item, except where such information is
expressly required to be disclosed, nor shall it be construed as or constitute
an admission or agreement that such information is material to the Company,
Blockers or any of the Sellers. Neither the specifications of any dollar
amount in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
nor the inclusion of any specific item in the Company Disclosure Letter is
intended to imply that such amount, or higher or lower amounts, or the item
so included or other items, are or are not material, and no Person shall use
the fact of the setting forth of any such amount or the inclusion of any such
item in any dispute or controversy between the parties as to whether any
other obligation, item or matter not described herein or included in the
Company Disclosure Letter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. Prior to the Closing, the Sellers and the Company shall have the
right from time to time to supplement, modify or update the Company
Disclosure Letter in order to add information relating to or resulting from
facts or events occurring subsequent to the execution of this Agreement (a "
_Schedule Supplement_ "). In the event that the Company and/or the
Representative provide any Schedule Supplement, the matters set forth on such
Schedule Supplement shall not be effective to cure and correct for purposes of
_Article X_ any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant which
would have existed if the Company and/or the Representative had not provided
such Schedule Supplement. In the event that prior to the Closing Date the
Company and/or the Representative provide to Buyer notification pursuant to
the terms of this _Section 12H_ of the failure of any condition in _Article
2_ as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant of
the Sellers, the Blockers or the Company due to facts or events occurring
subsequent to the execution of this Agreement that, but for this _Section
12H_, would entitle Buyer to not consummate the Closing (a " _Termination
Update_ "), Buyer may terminate this Agreement in accordance with  _Section
12H_. If Buyer proceeds to consummate the Closing after receiving a
Termination Update, Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any and all rights,
remedies or other recourse against the Company or the Sellers to which Buyer
might otherwise be entitled in respect of a breach that would be cured by
such Termination Update, including any rights or remedies under _Article X_
and such Termination Update shall be effective to cure and correct for all
other purposes any such breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
which would have existed if the Company and/or the Representative had not
provided such Termination Update, and all references to any Schedule hereto
which is supplemented or amended as provided in this _Section 12H_ shall for
all purposes after the Closing be deemed to be a reference to such Schedule as
so supplemented or amended. If Buyer proceeds to consummate the Closing after
receiving any Schedule Supplement that is not a Termination Update, Buyer
shall be entitled to exercise any rights or remedies pursuant to this
Agreement in respect of a breach that would be cured by such Schedule
Supplement, including any rights or remedies under _Article X_ , and
such Schedule Supplement shall not be effective to cure and correct for any
purpose any such breach of any representation, warranty or covenant which
would have existed if the Company and/or the Representative had not provided
such Schedule Supplement. To the extent any agreements, documents or other
items are represented in this Agreement as being provided to Buyer, such
agreements, documents or other items shall be considered delivered to Buyer
only if they were loaded into the Project Commodore datasite with Intralinks
prior to the date hereof.

12I. _No Additional Representations; Disclaimer_.

 

(i) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none of the Sellers, Blockers or the
Company nor any of their Affiliates or representatives, nor any other Person
acting on behalf of the Sellers, Blockers or the Company or any of their

by this Agreement without reliance on any representation or warranty, express
or implied, by the Company, Blockers, the Representative, the Sellers or
any of their respective Affiliates or representatives except for the

(iii) In connection with Buyers investigation of the Company, Buyer has
received from or on behalf of the Company certain projections, including
projected statements of operating revenues and income from operations of the
Company and certain business plan information of the Company. Buyer
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar
with such uncertainties, that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making
its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts), and that Buyer shall have no claim against any Seller Party or any
other Person with respect thereto. Accordingly, the Company makes no
representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts), and Buyer
has not relied thereon.

(including by means of telecopied or electronically transmitted signature
pages), all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
Agreement.

FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AGREE THAT VENUE WOULD BE PROPER IN SUCH
COURT, AND HEREBY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION THAT ANY SUCH COURT IS AN IMPROPER OR
INCONVENIENT FORUM FOR THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. THE
PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT THE MAILING BY CERTIFIED OR REGISTERED
MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, OF ANY PROCESS REQUIRED BY ANY SUCH COURT
SHALL CONSTITUTE VALID AND LAWFUL SERVICE OF PROCESS AGAINST THEM, WITHOUT

which the parties hereto are entitled at law or in equity.

12R. _Prevailing Party_. In the event any litigation or other court action,
arbitration or similar adjudicatory proceeding (a " _Proceeding_ ") is
commenced or threatened by any party hereto to enforce its rights under this
Agreement against any other party, if a prevailing party is determined in such
Proceeding, all fees, costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys fees and court costs, incurred by such prevailing party
in such Proceeding shall be reimbursed by the non-prevailing party; provided,
that if a party prevails in part, and loses in part, in such Proceeding, the
court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over such Proceeding shall
award a reimbursement of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the parties
on an equitable basis.
